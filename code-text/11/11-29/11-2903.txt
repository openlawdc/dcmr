THE PLATFORM (§ 11-2903)

2903.1. The buildings to be erected within the USN will be supported by two
   (2) platforms erected above the existing railroad tracks and separated by H
   Street, N.E. (the “Platform” or “Platforms”).

   2903.2. The Platforms will be generally horizontal structures that provide
   support for the new surface area, above the railroad tracks, on which
   development will be built.

   2903.3. In addition to providing structural support, the Platforms may house
   mechanical equipment, parking and loading areas, and non-residential,
   residential, retail, and arts uses permitted by §§ 2913 through 2916, as
   well as utilities and rail-related uses.

   2903.4. Structures below the grade of the railroad tracks and generally
   vertical, above-grade columns and structures will support the Platforms
   (collectively “Foundation Systems”).  The term “Platform” or
   “Platforms”, when used in this chapter, does not include Foundation
   Systems or any station and rail-related functions or facilities that are
   constructed below the Platforms on the subjacent lots.

   2903.5. Although portions of a Platform may extend below the volume of an air
   rights lot, any provision of this chapter pertaining to the Platform shall
   apply to the entire Platform.
