                                  DC REGULATIONS

ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT FACILITIES (C-3) (§ 11-745)

745.1. An Electronic Equipment Facility (EEF) that does not qualify as a
   matter-of-right use under § 741.8 may be permitted as a special exception in
   a C-3 District if approved by the Board of Zoning Adjustment under § 3104,
   subject to the requirements of this section.

   745.2. An EEF shall not occupy more than fifty percent (50%) of the
   constructed gross floor area of the building, unless approved as part of a
   planned unit development pursuant to chapter 24 of this title.

   745.3. An applicant seeking a special exception for an EEF shall demonstrate,
   in addition to the requirements of § 3104, that the proposed use will not, as
   a consequence of its design, operation, low employee presence, or proximity to
   other EEFs, inhibit future revitalization of the neighborhood, reduce the
   potential for vibrant streetscapes, deplete street life, or inhibit pedestrian
   or vehicular movement.

   745.4. In evaluating whether an EEF will have any of the adverse impacts
   described in § 745.3, the Board shall consider, in addition to other relevant
   factors, the:
   
   
   
   (a)	Absence of retail uses or a design capable of accommodating retail uses in
   the future;
   
   
   
   (b)	Presence of security or other elements in the design that could impair
   street life and pedestrian flow;
   
   
   
   (c)	Disruption of existing or elimination of officially proposed pedestrian or
   vehicular routes; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Inability of the EEF to be adapted in the future for permitted uses.

   745.5. The Board, in weighing the potentially adverse factors listed in §
   745.4(a) through (d), shall consider the economic development potential of the
   area in which the EEF is proposed to be established and shall give greater
   negative weight to these factors if the EEF is to be located in proximity to
   an existing or proposed Metrorail station or along a pedestrian corridor.

   745.6. The Board may give positive weight to any economic benefits that the
   proposed EEF will have on adjacent properties, including the potential for
   increased business activity within the neighborhood, if that activity will
   foster economic development.

   745.7. The Board may impose requirements pertaining to design, appearance,
   landscaping, parking, and other such requirements as it deems necessary to
   protect adjacent property and to achieve an active, safe, and vibrant street
   life.
