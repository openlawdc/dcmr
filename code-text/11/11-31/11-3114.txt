                                  DC REGULATIONS

REPORTS OF PUBLIC AGENCIES FOR APPLICATIONS (§ 11-3114)

3114.1. The rules of procedure in this section shall apply to all applications
   filed with the Board (including applications filed pursuant to §§ 3107 and
   3108 in effect prior to October 1, 1999, and §§ 3103 and 3104); provided,
   however, the provisions of this section shall only apply to chancery
   applications to the extent specified in § 3134.

   3114.2. When an application is referred in advance of the public hearing to
   any public agency for a report or recommendation, that report and
   recommendation shall be filed with the Board at least seven (7) days prior to
   the date set for the hearing on the application.

   3114.3. Upon agreement by all parties to a proceeding, the report and
   recommendation may become a part of the exclusive record at any time without
   benefit of cross-examination.

   3114.4. In the absence of any such agreement, the report and recommendation
   shall not become a part of the exclusive record unless an officer, member, or
   employee of the public agency appears at the hearing to present the report and
   recommendation and be cross-examined by the parties, unless the Board finds
   the report and recommendation to be full and complete on its face, having
   given due regard to the importance of the evidence, availability of witnesses,
   and the need of cross-examination for a full and true disclosure of the facts.

   3114.5. After consultation with the presiding officer, the Director shall
   notify those representatives of the public agency who should be present at the
   hearing.

   3114.6. If an application is referred in advance of the public hearing to any
   public agency for a report or recommendation, no report is received in the
   record, and the time period specified in § 2509 has elapsed, then the Board
   may proceed to decide the application based on the record not including such
   report and recommendation.
