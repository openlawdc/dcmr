   3104.2. In the case of a use that was originally permitted and lawfully
   established as a matter of right and for which the Zoning Regulations now
   require special exception approval from the Board of Zoning Adjustment, any
   extension or enlargement of that use shall require special exception approval
   from the Board.

   3104.3. In determining whether to approve any extension or enlargement under
   § 3104.2, the Board shall apply the standards and criteria of the Zoning
   Regulations to the entire use, rather than to just the proposed extension or
   enlargement.

   3104.4. Effective December 8, 2000, the Zoning Commission shall, pursuant to
   § 3035 and the standards in § 3104.1, hear and decide all applications for
   special exception approval under §§ 210, 302.2, 322.2, 332.2, 352.2, 507,
   615, and 916 of a campus development plan; the amendment of a campus
   development plan; the further processing of an approved campus development
   plan to permit the construction and use of a specific building or structure
   within a campus, whether the plan was approved by the Commission or the Board
   of Zoning Adjustment; and the interim use of land or improved property within
   a reasonable distance of a campus. The following table summarizes the uses
