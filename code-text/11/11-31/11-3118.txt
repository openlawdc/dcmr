EXPEDITED REVIEW (§ 11-3118)

3118.1 	The purpose of this section is to create an expedited review process
   to be followed after an applicant waives its right to a hearing for an
   eligible application.
   
   
   
   3118.2 	An eligible application is an application for:
   
   
   
   (a) 	An addition to a one-family dwelling or flat or new or enlarged accessory
   structures pursuant to § 223; or
   
   
   
   (b) 	A park, playground, swimming pool, or athletic field pursuant to §
   209.1.
   
   
   
   3118.3 	Subject to the removal process described in §§ 3118.6 and 3118.7, an
   eligible application that includes a waiver of hearing will be placed on an
   expedited review calendar and decided without hearing at the Board’s next
   regularly scheduled session after:
   
   
   
   (a)	The completion of the public notice procedures set forth in § 3118.4; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The completion of the ANC review period of thirty (30) days from the date
   it receives notice of the application, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and
   holidays, plus an additional fourteen (14) calendar days.

   3118.4. Notice of expedited review shall be given in the same manner and
   include the same information as required by §§ 3113.12 through 3113.16,
   except that references to “public hearing” or “hearing” shall mean
   “expedited review” and all other requirements of § 3113 shall apply with
   the same proviso.

   3118.5. The public notice of an expedited review and the ANC notice of an
   application requesting expedited review shall also indicate:
   
   
   
   (a)	The procedure for requesting the removal of the application from the
   expedited review calendar is as described in §§ 3118.6 and 3118.7; and
   
   
   
   (b)	That the only public notice of the hearing date for a removed application
   will be the posting of that date in the Office of Zoning beginning on the date
   that the application was removed and continuing until the date of such
   hearing.

   3118.6. An application tentatively placed on an expedited review calendar will
   be removed and rescheduled for a hearing:
   
   
   
   (a)	At the oral or written request of a Board member made at any time prior to
   the vote on the application;
   
   
   
   (b)	Upon the receipt of a timely filed request for party status in opposition
   to the application; or
   
   
   
   (c)	At the written request of the Office of Planning, if filed with the Office
   of Zoning no later than fourteen (14) days prior to the date that the
   expedited review is scheduled.

   3118.7. An application tentatively placed on an expedited review calendar also
   will be removed and rescheduled for a hearing if requested by the following
   entities or persons in accordance with § 3118.8, unless the request is denied
   by the Presiding Officer pursuant to § 3118.9:
   
   
   
   (a)	The affected ANC(s) or affected Single Member District(s);
   
   
   
   (b)	The Councilmember representing the area in which the subject property is
   located or representing an area located within two-hundred feet (200 ft.) of
   the subject property; or
   
   
   
   (c)	The owner or occupant of any property located within two-hundred feet (200
   ft.) of the subject property.

   3118.8. A request to remove made pursuant to § 3118.7 shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	Be filed with the Office of Zoning no later than fourteen (14) days prior
   to the date that the expedited review is scheduled;
   
   
   
   (b)	Be accompanied by a statement indicating that the requester, or the
   requester’s representative, intends to appear as a witness at the hearing;
   and
   
   
   
   (c)	Shall include a summary proffer of the testimony to be given at that time.

   3118.9. The Presiding Officer shall grant a request to remove an application
   made pursuant to § 3118.7 unless the proffered testimony is irrelevant, in
   which case the request shall be denied.

   3118.10. Orders granting an application approved by expedited review need not
   contain findings of facts or conclusions of law, but shall reflect the nature
   of the relief granted and any conditions imposed.
