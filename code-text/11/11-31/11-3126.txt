RECONSIDERATION OR REHEARING (ยง 11-3126)

3126.1. This section applies to all appeals and applications filed with the
   Board under this chapter; provided, however, this section only applies to
   chancery applications to the extent specified in ยง 3134.

   3126.2. Any party may file a motion for reconsideration or rehearing of any
   decision of the Board, provided that the motion is filed with the Director
   within ten (10) days from the date of issuance of a final written order by the
   Board.  The Board shall not receive or consider any motion for
   reconsideration, rehearing, or re-argument of a final order in a contested
   case proceeding that is filed prior to the order being issued nor waive this
   prohibition.

   3126.3. Any motion for reconsideration shall be served upon all other parties,
   or any representative parties pursuant to designations made pursuant to ยง
   3112.15.

   3126.4. A motion for reconsideration shall state specifically all respects in
   which the final decision is claimed to be erroneous, the grounds of the
   motion, and the relief sought.

   3126.5. Within seven (7) days after a motion for reconsideration has been
   filed and served, any other party may file an answer in opposition to or in
   support of such motion.

   3126.6. No request for rehearing shall be considered by the Board unless new
   evidence is submitted that could not reasonably have been presented at the
   original hearing. If a rehearing is granted, notice shall be given as in the
   case of an original hearing.

   3126.7. The Board, on its own motion made not later than ten (10) days
   following the filing of the final decision in the record, may decide to
   reconsider or rehear an application or appeal.

   3126.8. No member shall vote on any post-hearing motion unless the member
   participated in, and voted on, the original decision, or the member read the
   transcript of the hearings and reviewed the record.

   3126.9. Unless the Board orders otherwise, neither the filing nor granting of
   a motion for reconsideration or rehearing shall automatically stay the effect
   of a final decision.

   3126.10. A motion for reconsideration or rehearing shall not be a prerequisite
   to judicial review.

   3126.11. An appellant or applicant whose appeal or application has been denied
   shall not institute a new appeal or application on the same facts within one
   (1) year from the date of the order upon the previous appeal or application.
