PRE-HEARING PROCEDURES FOR APPLICATIONS (§ 11-3113)

3113.1. The rules of procedure in this section apply to all applications filed
   with the Board (including applications filed pursuant to §§ 3107 and 3108 in
   effect prior to October 1, 1999, and §§ 3103 and 3104); provided, however,
   the provisions of this section only apply to chancery applications to the
   extent specified in § 3134 and to applications processed under the expedited
   review procedures to the extent specified in § 3118.

   3113.2. As an alternative to filing the zoning memorandum as required by the
   application form, applications for variances and special exceptions may be
   filed with the Director by architects or attorneys without the necessity of
   prior certification by the Zoning Administrator, provided that the architect
   or attorney certifies that the requirements set forth in the immediately
   following sentence are true and correct. Such architect or attorney shall
   certify to the Board that: (a) the architect or attorney is duly licensed to
   practice in the District of Columbia; (b) the architect or attorney currently
   is in good standing and otherwise entitled to practice in the District of
   Columbia; and (c) the applicant is entitled to apply for the variance or
   special exception sought for the reasons stated in the application. Nothing in
   this subsection is intended to affect the discretion of the Director to reject
   an application for failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection or
   this title.

   3113.3. The owner of property for which application is made may file an
   application with the Board.

   3113.4. An authorized agent may file an application on behalf of the owner.
   The application shall include a letter signed by the owner authorizing the
   agent to act on the owner&#8217;s behalf in respect of the application. The
   Board may at any time require additional evidence demonstrating the authority
   of the agent to act for the owner.

   3113.5. Each application to the Board shall be made on the appropriate form
   provided by the Board. All information required by the form shall be furnished

   (a)	The name and addresses of the owners of all property located within two
   hundred feet (200 ft.) of the subject property; provided, however, in the case
   of a residential condominium or cooperative with twenty-five (25) or more
   dwelling units, mailed notice may be provided to the board of directors or to
   the association of the condominium or cooperative that represents all of the
   owners of all the dwelling units; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The name and address of each person having a lease with the owner for all
   or part of any building located on the property involved in the application.

   shall not authorize the removal of any document from the files of the Board.

   the Board, a new application shall not be accepted for filing again for at
   least ninety (90) days after withdrawal of the application.

   3113.11. Without leave of the Board, an application dismissed by the Board for
