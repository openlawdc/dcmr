PRE-HEARING PROCEDURES FOR APPEALS (§ 11-3112)

3112.1. The rules of procedure in this section apply to all appeals filed with
   the Board pursuant to §§ 3100 and 3200.

   3112.2. Any person aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision,
   determination, or refusal made by an administrative officer or body, including
   the Mayor of the District of Columbia, in the administration or enforcement of
   the Zoning Regulations may file a timely appeal with the Board as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	An appeal shall be filed within sixty (60) days from the date the person
   appealing the administrative decision had notice or knowledge of the decision
   complained of, or reasonably should have had notice or knowledge of the
   decision complained of, whichever is earlier.
   
   
   
   (b)	If the decision complained of involves the erection, construction,
   reconstruction, conversion, or alteration of a structure or part thereof, the
   following subparagraphs shall establish the latest date on which an appeal may
   be filed:
   
   
   
   (1)	No appeal shall be filed later than ten (10) days after the date on which
   the structure or part thereof in question is under roof. For purposes of this
   subparagraph, the phrase &#8220;under roof&#8221; means the stage of
   completion of a structure or part thereof when the main roof of the structure
   or part thereof, and the roofs of any structures on the main roof or part
   thereof, are in place; and
   
   
   
   (2)	The provisions of paragraph (b) of this subsection shall not relieve an
   appellant of the jurisdictional requirement in paragraph (a) of this
   subsection of filing a timely appeal.
   
   
   
   (c)	Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, for purposes of
   establishing the timeliness of an appeal under this subsection, an appellant
   shall have a minimum of sixty (60) days from the date of the administrative
   decision complained of in which to file an appeal.
   
   
   
   (d)	The Board may extend the sixty- (60) day deadline for the filing of an
   appeal only if the appellant demonstrates that:
   
   
   
   (1)	There are exceptional circumstances that are outside of the
   appellant&#8217;s control and could not have been reasonably anticipated that
   substantially impaired the appellant&#8217;s ability to file an appeal to the
   Board; and
   
   
   
   (2)	The extension of time will not prejudice the parties to the appeal, as
   identified in § 3199.1.

   3112.3. An authorized agent may file an appeal on behalf of the aggrieved
   person.

   3112.4. If an agent files an appeal, the appeal shall include a letter signed

   behalf in the appeal. The Board may at any time require additional evidence
   demonstrating the authority of the agent to act for the appellant.

   3112.5. Each appeal shall be made on the appropriate form provided by the
   Board. All information required by such form shall be furnished by the
   appellant at the time of filing the appeal.

   3112.6. At the time of filing the appeal, any fee established by the Mayor of
   the District of Columbia shall be paid to the District of Columbia Treasurer.

   3112.7. Each appeal, along with any application filed pursuant to § 3113,
   shall be numbered serially and docketed and may be placed upon the calendar of

   copy of the appeal form shall be sent to the ANC for the area within which the
   property is located.

   3112.8. A public hearing shall be held on each appeal to the Board.

   3112.9. Appeals shall be heard in the order in which they appear on the
   calendar; provided, the hearing date for an appeal may be advanced by order of

   the appeal, the appellant shall file with the Board any additional statements,
   information, briefs, reports (including reports or statements of expert and
   other witnesses), plans, or other materials that the appellant may wish to
   offer into evidence at the hearing. Any map, plan, or other document or matter
   readily available to the general public need only be fully referenced and the
   source given by the appellant in place of filing a copy.

   3112.11. The appellant may withdraw an appeal at any time. Withdrawal shall
   not authorize the removal of any document from the files of the Board. The
   appeal fee shall not be refunded upon withdrawal. Without special leave of the
   Board, a new appeal shall not be accepted again for filing for at least ninety
   (90) days after withdrawal of the appeal.

   3112.12. Without special leave of the Board, an appeal dismissed by the Board
   for failure to comply with the procedural requirements of this title shall not

   the order dismissing the appeal.

   3112.13. Notice of a public hearing on an appeal shall include the number of
   the appeal, the administrative action appealed from, the name of the

   3112.15. At the time of the hearing on the appeal, the Board shall consider
   any request to intervene made pursuant to § 3106.2.  The Board shall grant
   intervener status only if the person requesting intervener status has clearly
   demonstrated that they have a specific right or interest that will be affected
   by action on the appeal.

   3112.16. In granting intervener status, the Board may specify whether the
   person will be permitted to intervene in the appeal for general or limited
