VARIANCES (§ 11-3103)

3103.1. [DELETED]

   3103.2. With respect to variances, the Board has the power under § 8 of the
   Zoning Act, D.C. Official Code § 6-641.07(g)(3)(2001) (formerly codified at
   D.C. Code § 5-424 (g)(3) (1994 Repl.)), &#8220;[ w]here, by reason of
   exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of property
   at the time of the original adoption of the regulations, or by reason of
   exceptional topographical conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional
   situation or condition of a specific piece of property, the strict application
   of any regulation adopted under D.C. Official Code §§ 6-641.01 to 6-651.02
   would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or
   exceptional and undue hardship upon the owner of the property, to authorize,
   upon an appeal relating to the property, a variance from the strict
   application so as to relieve the difficulties or hardship; provided, that the
   relief can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and
   without substantially impairing the intent, purpose, and integrity of the zone
   plan as embodied in the Zoning Regulations and Map.&#8221;

   3103.3. Variances are classified as area variances or use variances.

   3103.4. An area variance is a request to deviate from an area requirement
   applicable to the zone district in which the property is located.

   3103.5. Examples of area variances are requests to deviate from:
   
   
   
   (a)	Requirements that affect the size, location, and placement of buildings
   and other structures such as height, floor area ratio, lot occupancy, yard
   width and depth, and minimum court size;
   
   
   
   (b)	Minimum parking or loading requirements to an extent greater than what may
   be permitted by special exception;
   
   
   
   (c)	Limitations on the extent to which the gross floor area of a building may
   be occupied by a matter of right non-residential use;
   
   
   
   (d)	Limitations on the alteration or conversion of certain structures on alley
   lots as stated in § 2507.3;
   
   
   
   (e)	The prohibition against certain enlargements and additions to
   nonconforming structures as stated at § 2001.3; and
   
   
   
   (f)	Preconditions to the establishment of a matter of right use including, but
   not limited to, the minimum land area requirement of § 401.3 applicable to
   the conversion of a building an apartment house as permitted by § 330.5(e);
   provided that the waiver would not cause the proposed use to meet the
   definition of a more intense use.

   3103.6. A use variance is a request to permit:
   
   
   
   (a)	A use that is not permitted by right or special exception in the zone
   district where the property is located;
   
   
   
   (b)	A use that is expressly prohibited in the zone district where the property
   is located; or
   
   
   
   (c)	An expansion of a nonconforming use prohibited by § 2002.3.

   3103.7. The standard for granting a variance, as stated in § 3103.2 differs
   with respect to use and area variances as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	An applicant for an area variance must prove that as a result of the
   attributes of a specific piece of property described in § 3103.2, the strict
   application of a zoning regulation would result in peculiar and exceptional
   practical difficulties to the owner of property; and
   
   
   
   (b) 	An applicant for a use variance must prove that as a result of the
   attributes of a specific piece of property described in § 3103.2, the strict
   application of a zoning regulation would result in exceptional and undue
   hardship upon the owner of the property.
