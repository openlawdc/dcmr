                                  DC REGULATIONS

REVIEW BY ZONING COMMISSION (ยง 11-3128)

3128.1. Within the ten (10) day period set forth in ยง 3125.9, the Zoning
   Commission may, sua sponte, determine to review any final decision or order of
   the Board.

   3128.2. The Commission&#8217;s determination to review a decision or order of
   the Board shall be transmitted forthwith to the Director, who shall forward to
   the Commission the record in the case and shall serve notice of the
   Commission&#8217;s determination to review the Board&#8217;s decision or order
   upon all parties to such case.

   3128.3. Upon receipt of the record, the Commission shall review the case and
   take such action as it deems appropriate; provided, however, the Commission
   shall not reverse or modify any decision or order of the Board without
   affording the parties to the case an opportunity to present memoranda to the
   Commission in support of or in opposition to the action of the Board.

   3128.4. Any action by the Commission may include, without limitation, any of
   the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Hearing argument on the Board record in the case;
   
   
   
   (b)	Affirmance, modification, or reversal of the Board&#8217;s decision or
   order; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Remanding the case to the Board for reconsideration, rehearing, or other
   action pursuant to instructions of the Commission.

   3128.5. The sua sponte review process established in this section shall not
   grant any rights of appeal to the Commission.

   3128.6. Because there is no right of appeal to the Commission from any action
   of the Board, the Commission need not answer any communications to the
   Commission (regardless of the form) requesting that sua sponte review be
   undertaken. Sua sponte review is a discretionary internal process.

   3128.7. The Commission shall look to the following guidelines when determining
   whether to invoke its sua sponte review authority. The Commission may exercise
   sua sponte review as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	In a particular instance where it appears to the Commission that the Board
   has exceeded its prerogatives and has thus in effect changed the zoning;
   
   
   
   (b)	Where it appears that a basic policy of the Commission, as expressed in
   the Zoning Regulations, has been violated as a result of action by the Board;
   or
   
   
   
   (c)	In an unusual instance, as determined by the Commission.
