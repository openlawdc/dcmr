   3129.2. The Board shall consider requests to approve minor modifications to
   plans approved by the Board, as set forth in §§ 3125.7 and 3125.8. The

   written comments that such party may have concerning the requested
   modification.

   3129.5. A decision on a request for minor modification of plans shall be made
   by the Board on the basis of the written request, the plans submitted
   therewith, and any responses thereto from other parties to the original
   application.
   
   
   
   3129.6 	Approval of requests for modification of approved plans shall be
   limited to minor modifications that do not change the material facts upon
   which the Board based its original approval of the application.

   3129.7. A request to modify other aspects of a Board order may be made at
   anytime, but shall require a hearing.

   limited to impact of the modification on the subject of the original
   application, and shall not permit the Board to revisit its original decision.

   3129.9. The filing of any modification request under this section shall not
   act to toll the expiration of the underlying order and the grant of any such
   modification shall not extend the validity of any such order.
