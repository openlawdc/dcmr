   the M District if approved by the Board of Zoning Adjustment under § 3104,
   subject to the provisions specified in this section.

   822.2. Any establishment whose principal use is the administration of massages
   shall be permitted; provided:
   
   
   
   (a)	The establishment shall be compatible with other uses in the area;
   
   
   
   (b)	The use shall not be objectionable because of its effect on the character
   of the neighborhood or because of noise, traffic, or other conditions; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The establishment shall not have an adverse impact on religious,
   educational, or other institutional facilities located in the area.

   822.3. Any establishment to be used as a solid waste handling facility shall
   be permitted only if the following requirements are met:
   
   
   
   (a)	No portion of the facility, including any structure, loading dock, truck
   bay, storage container, transfer equipment, or any other processing equipment
   or operation shall be located within three hundred feet (300 ft.) of a

   (c)	The facility shall be designed to have access to a railway siding or spur
   to enable the transportation by rail of solid waste out of the District of
   Columbia. Solid waste shall be shipped from a facility by rail, except that

   litter, fire hazards, decomposition gases, vehicle and other pollution, or
   other hazards or objectionable conditions;
   
   
   
   (e)	The applicant shall provide credible evidence to the Board to demonstrate

   (1/4) of a mile of the site;
   
   
   
   (2)	A site plan showing the layout of the proposed facility, including main
   buildings, fences and screens, access to rail if available, street access,
   parking and queuing areas, and a functional diagram indicating the proposed
   use of the site;
   
   
   
   (3)	An operating plan indicating types of waste to be accepted at the facility

   not abut residential neighborhoods along the way, with the objective of
   minimizing potential adverse impacts on adjacent neighborhoods; and
   
   
   
   (6)	A certified statement by an architect or engineer licensed in the District
   of Columbia that the facility as sited and designed to the best of his or her

   including without limitation, regulations adopted pursuant to the Solid Waste
   Facility Permit Act of 1995, effective February 27, 1996 (D.C. Law 11-94, as
   amended; D.C. Official Code §§ 8-1051 to 8-1063 (formerly codified at D.C.
   Code §§ 6-3451 to 3463 (1999 Supp.)));
   
   
   
   (f)	There shall be no truck access, parking, standing or queuing to the
   facility from any street or block-long portion of a street for which fifty
   percent (50%) or more of the abutting properties on either side are used for
   residential purposes. No truck dumping or picking up solid waste shall park,
   stand, or queue for the facility from any public right-of-way. Vehicular
   traffic resulting from operations at the facility shall not obstruct traffic.
   The location of the facility shall provide access from a paved street with a
   road base capable of withstanding anticipated load limits;
   
   
   
   (g)	The facility shall also be subject to the &#8220;Standards of External
   Effects (C-M)&#8221; in § 804 and the District of Columbia Noise Control Act
   of 1977, effective March 16, 1978 (D.C. Law 2-53, as amended), and Standards,
   20 DCMR chapters 27 &#8211; 29;
   
   
   
   (h)	All solid waste handling activities, including depositing, processing,
   separation and loading shall be within a fully enclosed building to minimize
   the adverse impacts due to noise, traffic, parking, odors, rodents and other

   vehicle and other pollution, and other hazards or objectionable conditions;
   
   
   
   (i)	The facility shall be enclosed on all sides by an opaque fence or wall at
   least ten feet (10 ft.) high. The facility shall be secured from unauthorized
   deposit and removal of solid waste or other materials when attendants are not
   present; and
   
   
   
   (j)	The facility shall provide on-site parking and queuing as follows:
   
   
   
   (1)	Space shall be provided on-site to park each commercial vehicle operated
   by the facility;
   
   
   
   (2)	One employee parking space shall be provided for each commercial vehicle
   lawfully parked on the site after operating hours;
   
   
   
   (3)	If the facility serves the public, all parking and queuing space shall be
   provided on-site to accommodate projected peak demand; and
   
   
   
   (4)	Additional parking, truck maneuvering, or queuing space may be required by
   the Board after considering the applicant&#8217;s analysis of such needs and
   the reports of the D.C. Department of Transportation and the Office of
   Planning. However, at a minimum, the facility shall be configured in such a
   manner that trucks entering or leaving the facility shall not back in from or
   back out onto any public right-of- way.

   822.4. The Board may proscribe or require specific operating hours for the
   facility and the use of any street or highway for trucks entering or leaving
   the facility to lessen traffic congestion and otherwise assure the quiet
   enjoyment of residential uses adjacent to a facility.

   822.5. Nothing in this section shall preclude the Board from imposing
   additional or more strict conditions pertaining to design, screening,
   buffering, lighting, soundproofing, signs, or any matter necessary to protect
   adjacent property, and special consideration will be given to protecting
   residential property from excessive noise and traffic

   822.6. In determining whether to grant a special exception, the Board shall
   not take into consideration whether the District of Columbia government issued
   the applicant an interim operating permit for the facility. The granting of a
   special exception to a facility does not authorize that facility to operate,
   unless the facility has been granted all other forms of permission required
   for solid waste handling facilities, including, but not limited to, a valid
   interim operating permit or solid waste facility permit. A solid waste
   handling facility that has been granted a special exception remains obligated
   to abide by all laws applicable to solid waste handling facilities and is
   subject to all claims or enforcement actions that may arise from violations of
   the laws.

   822.7. Any otherwise valid interim permit issued by the District government to
   the operator of a solid waste handling facility shall be given effect by the
   Board only during the pendency of the Board&#8217;s consideration of an
   application. In the event the Board denies the application, the continued
   operation of the facility shall be unlawful. In the event the Board grants an
   application, it may provide the applicant a reasonable time in which to
   construct the facility as approved by the Board.

   822.8. For purposes of this section, &#8220;solid waste&#8221; shall not
   include hazardous waste, which shall be subject to other regulations.

   822.9. An Electronic Equipment Facility (EEF) that does not qualify as a
   matter-of-right use under § 801 may be permitted as a special exception.

   822.10. An applicant seeking a special exception for an EEF shall demonstrate,
   in addition to the requirements of § 3104, that the proposed use will not, as
   a consequence of its design, operation, low employee presence, or proximity to
   other EEFs, inhibit future revitalization of the neighborhood, reduce the
   potential for vibrant streetscapes, deplete street life, or inhibit pedestrian
   or vehicular traffic.

   822.11. In evaluating whether an EEF will have any of the adverse impacts
   described in § 822.10, the Board shall consider, in addition to other
   relevant factors, the:
   
   
   
   (a)	Absence of retail uses or of a design capable of accommodating retail uses
   in the future;
   
   
   
   (b)	Presence of security or other elements in the design that could impair
   street life and pedestrian flow;
   
   
   
   (c)	Disruption of existing or elimination of officially proposed pedestrian or
   vehicular routes; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Inability of the EEF to be adapted in the future for permitted uses.

   822.12. The Board, in weighing the potentially adverse factors listed in §
   822.11(a) through (d), shall consider the economic development potential of
   the area in which the EEF is proposed to be established and shall give greater
   negative weight to these factors if the EEF is to be located in proximity to
   an existing or proposed Metrorail station or along a pedestrian corridor.

   822.13. The Board may give positive weight to any economic benefits that the
   proposed EEF will have on adjacent properties, including the potential for
   increased business activity within the neighborhood, if that activity will
   foster economic development.

   822.14. In approving an EEF, the Board may impose requirements pertaining to
   design, appearance, landscaping, parking, and other such requirements as it
   deems necessary to protect adjacent property and to achieve an active, safe,
   and vibrant street life

   822.15. An asphalt plant shall be permitted as a special exception in the M
   District if approved by the Board of Zoning Adjustment under § 3104, subject
   to the provisions of §§ 802.17 through 802.20.

   822.16. An animal boarding use may be permitted as a special exception if
   approved by the Board of Zoning Adjustment under § 3104, subject to the
   requirements of this section.

   822.17. The animal boarding use shall be located and designed to create no
   condition objectionable to adjacent properties resulting from animal noise,
   odor, or waste.

   822.18. The animal boarding use shall not abut a Residence District.

   822.19. External yards or other exterior facilities for the keeping of animals
   shall not be permitted.

   (c)	The pet grooming establishment shall not abut an existing residential use
   or a Residence District;
   
   
   
   (d)	External yards or other external facilities for the keeping of animals

   (f)	The Board may impose additional requirements as it deems necessary to
   protect adjacent or nearby properties.

   Board of Zoning Adjustment under § 3104, subject to the requirements of this
   subsection.

   condition to adjacent properties resulting from animal noise, odor, or waste;
   
   
   
   (b)	The pet shop shall not abut an existing residential use or a Residence
   District;
