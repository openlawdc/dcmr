842.1. A rear yard shall be provided for each structure located in an
   Industrial District.

   842.2. Except as provided in § 842.5, the rear yard need not be provided
   below a horizontal plane twenty feet (20 ft.) above the mean finished grade at
   the middle of the rear of the structure.

   842.3. For that portion of the structure above the horizontal plane, the depth
   of rear yard may be measured as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	When the lot abuts an alley, from the center line of the alley to the rear
   wall of the portion immediately above the plane; or
   
   
   
   (b)	When the lot does not abut an alley, from the rear lot line to the rear
   wall of the portion immediately above the plane.

   842.4. The minimum depth of the rear yard shall be two and one-half inches per
   foot (2.5 in./ft.) of vertical distance from the mean finished grade at the
   middle of the rear of the structure to the highest point of the main roof or
   parapet wall, but not less than twelve feet (12 ft.).

   842.5. Where the rear lot line of a lot abuts a Residence District or is
   separated only by an alley from a Residence District, the waiver in § 842.2
   shall not apply and a rear yard shall be provided from the ground up.

   842.6. In the case of a through lot or a corner lot abutting three (3) or more
   streets, the depth of rear yard may be measured from the center line of the
   street abutting the lot at the rear of the structure.
