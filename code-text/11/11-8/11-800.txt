                                  DC REGULATIONS

COMMERCIAL-LIGHT MANUFACTURING DISTRICTS (C-M) (§ 11-800)

800.1. The Commercial-Light Manufacturing (C-M) Districts are intended to
   provide sites for heavy commercial and light manufacturing activities
   employing large numbers of people and requiring some heavy machinery under
   controls that minimize any adverse effect on other nearby, more restrictive
   districts.

   800.2. Heavy truck traffic and loading and unloading operations are expected
   to be characteristic of C-M Districts.

   800.3. The three (3) C-M Districts provide a varying schedule for both density
   and height controls. They shall be mapped throughout the District of Columbia,
   and shall embrace areas used for low density warehousing as well as areas
   presently improved with both high and medium density buildings in warehousing,
   light manufacturing, office, and automotive usage.

   800.4. Except as is explicitly provided in § 801, no new dwelling shall be
   permitted in a C-M District.

   800.5. Except as provided in chapters 20 through 25 of this title, in a C-M
   District, no building or premises shall be used and no building shall be
   erected or altered that is arranged, intended, or designed to be used except
   for one (1) or more of the uses listed in §§ 801 through 803.

   800.6. No use specifically prohibited in an M District shall be permitted in a
   C-M District.
