                                  DC REGULATIONS

REGULATION OF ANTENNAS (ยง 11-2520)

2520.1. The purposes for the regulation of antennas as a particular type of
   structure shall be as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	The Zoning Commission has determined that certain antennas, because of
   their size, shape, design, construction, or location may affect the health,
   welfare, or safety of the population and may detract from the streetscape,
   landscape, skyline, scenic beauty, or aesthetic interests of Washington, D.C.,
   and its role as the Nation&#8217;s Capital;
   
   
   
   (b)	The Zoning Regulations therefore regulate the size, height, construction,
   design, and location of antennas and antenna structures that have the greatest
   potential for adverse impact on the health, safety, and welfare of the
   population and on neighborhood quality, and those which have the greatest
   potential for adverse impact on the scenic beauty of the Nation&#8217;s
   Capital; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The principal types of antennas regulated are those that, because of their
   shape and relatively large mass, potentially have the greatest visual impact
   and include, by example, large satellite earth station antennas and certain
   microwave terrestrial antennas.

   2520.2. If the Zoning Administrator determines that an antenna does not meet
   the definition of any specific class of an antenna in ยง 199.1, the Zoning
   Administrator shall determine the class of antenna to which it is closest and
   treat the antenna accordingly.
