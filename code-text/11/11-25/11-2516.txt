   on alley lots pursuant to § 2507), and §§ 3202.2 and 3202.3 are met.

   2516.5. If a principal building has no street frontage, as determined by
   dividing the subdivided lot into theoretical building sites for each principal
   building, the following provisions shall apply:
   
   
   
   (a)	The front of the building shall be the side upon which the principal
   entrance is located;
   
   
   
   (b)	Open space in front of the entrance shall be required that is equivalent
   either to the required rear yard in the zone district in which the building is
   located or to the distance between the building restriction line recorded on
   the records of the Surveyor of the District of Columbia for the subdivided lot
   and the public space upon which the subdivided lot fronts, whichever is
   greater;
   
   
   
   (c)	A rear yard shall be required; and
   
   
   
   (d)	If any part of the boundary of a theoretical lot is located in common with
   the rear lot line of the subdivided lot of which it is a part, the rear yard
   of the theoretical lot shall be along the boundary of the subdivided lot.
   
   
   
   2516.6 	In providing for net density pursuant to § 2516.11, the Board shall
   require at least the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The area of land that forms a covenanted means of ingress or egress shall
   not be included in the area of any theoretical lot, or in any yard that is
   required by this title;
   
   
   
   (b)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, each means of vehicular
   ingress or egress to any principal building shall be twenty-five feet (25 ft.)
   in width, but need not be paved for its entire width;
   
   
   
   (c)	If there are not at least two (2) entrances or exits from the means of
   ingress or egress, a turning area shall be provided with a diameter of not
   less than sixty feet (60 ft.); and
   
   
   
   (d)	The requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection may be
   modified if the Board finds that a lesser width or diameter will be compatible
   with, and will not be likely to have an adverse effect on, the present
   character and future development of the neighborhood; provided, that the Board
   shall give specific consideration to the spacing of buildings and the
   availability of resident, guest, and service parking.

   2516.7. Where not in conflict with the Act to Regulate the Height of Buildings

   building.

   2516.8. [DELETED].

   2516.9. The proposed development shall comply with the substantive provisions
