ZONE DISTRICT BOUNDARY LINE CROSSING A LOT (ยง 11-2514)

2514.1. When a zone district boundary line divides a lot that was in single
   ownership on May 12, 1958, the permitted use and bulk of a structure located
   on that lot may be determined as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	The allowable bulk for the portion of the lot located in a lesser
   restrictive use zone district may be increased by the bulk permitted on the
   portion of the lot located in a more restrictive use zone district; provided,
   that no portion of any structure permitted on the lesser restricted portion of
   the lot shall be extended to the more restricted portion of the lot;
   
   
   
   (b)	The calculation for determining additional bulk shall include only that
   portion of the lot in the more restrictive use zone district that is located
   within thirty-five feet (35 ft.) of the zone district boundary line;
   
   
   
   (c)	The additional bulk authorized in this section shall not exceed the
   maximum bulk permitted on the portion of the lot located in the lesser
   restrictive use zone district;
   
   
   
   (d)	For computation purposes, any portion of the lot located in an R-1 or R-2
   District shall be deemed to be limited to a floor area ratio of four-tenths
   (0.4), any portion of the lot located in an R-3 District shall be deemed to be
   limited to a floor area ratio of six-tenths (0.6), and any portion of the lot
   located in an R-4 District shall be deemed to be limited to a floor area ratio
   of nine-tenths (0.9); and
   
   
   
   (e)	Except for accessory open parking facilities permitted elsewhere in this
   title, the portion of the lot located in a more restrictive use zone district
   shall be devoted only to required yards or courts or other open spaces.

   2514.2. If approved by the Board of Zoning Adjustment as a special exception
   under ยง 3104, the regulations applicable to that portion of a lot located in
   a lesser restrictive use zone district that control the use, height, and bulk
   of structures and the use of land may be extended to that portion of the lot
   in a more restrictive use zone district; provided:
   
   
   
   (a)	The extension shall be limited to that portion of the lot in the more
   restrictive use zone district but not exceeding thirty-five feet (35 ft.);
   
   
   
   (b)	In authorizing an extension, the Board shall require compliance with ยง
   2514.1(d);
   
   
   
   (c)	The extension shall have no adverse effect upon the present character and
   future development of the neighborhood; and
   
   
   
   (d)	The Board may impose requirements pertaining to design, appearance,
   screening, location of structures, lighting, or any other requirements it
   deems necessary to protect adjacent or nearby property.

   established in this title are listed in the following groups of decreasing use
   restrictions:
