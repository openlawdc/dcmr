HISTORIC PRESERVATION (DD) (§ 11-1707)

1707.1. The most directly applicable policies and objectives from the
   Comprehensive Plan and other adopted policies for Downtown may be summarized
   as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	Preserve the unique character and fabric of historic buildings, the
   Downtown Historic District, and the Pennsylvania Avenue Historic Site;
   
   
   
   (b)	Encourage restoration and adaptive reuse of historic landmarks and
   contributing buildings in historic districts, together with compatible
   alterations and compatible new construction;
   
   
   
   (c)	Restrict permitted building bulk on critical historic frontages and lots
   with historic buildings so as to encourage preservation of historic buildings
   and assure a suitable scale of new construction in historic districts,
   especially in projects combining new development with preservation;
   
   
   
   (d)	Permit flexibility as to building height, rear yard, and court
   requirements so as to allow maximum design flexibility for the massing and
   sculpting of the restricted building mass in relationship to the scale and
   character of affected historic buildings on the lot and nearby subject to the
   exterior design review and controls exercised by the Historic Preservation
   Review Board;
   
   
   
   (e)	Provide appropriate economic incentives to encourage preservation,
   including suitable on-site density and transferable development rights; and
   
   
   
   (f)	Encourage occupancy of historic buildings by active uses such as arts,
   cultural, entertainment, retail, and small business uses, in keeping with the
   potential of historic buildings to make multiple contributions to the
   character of a &#8220;Living Downtown.&#8221;
