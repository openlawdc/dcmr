                                  DC REGULATIONS

CALCULATION OF GREEN AREA RATIO (§ 11-3402)

3402.1. The GAR shall be calculated using the following formula:
   
   
   
   (area of landscape element 1 x multiplier)+
   
   GAR = 	(area of landscape element 2 x multiplier)+…
   
   						Lot Area
   
   3402.1 	For the purposes of the above formula and the remainder of this
   chapter:
   
   The term “landscape element” refers to one of the elements listed in the
   table in § 3402.9, and will be hereafter referred to as “landscape
   element” or “element”;
   
   
   
   
   
   The term “multiplier” refers to the number listed in the Table in §
   3402.9 that corresponds to a “landscape element”; and
   
   
   
   
   
   The “area of landscape element” shall be  the square feet of a landscape
   element, unless the element is a tree or large shrub, in which case “area of
   landscape element” refers to the element’s equivalent square footage as
   indicated in  § 3402.7.
   
   3402.3 	The process for calculating a property’s GAR under the formula is as
   follows:
   
   The area of each landscape element is multiplied by its corresponding
   multiplier;
   
   
   
   
   
   The resulting numbers for all landscape elements are added together;
   
   
   
   
   
   The resulting point total is then divided by the total land area of the lot;
   and
   
   
   
   
   
   The product of the equation equals the property’s GAR.

   3402.4. The total points for all permeable paving and enhanced tree growth
   credits may not count for more than one-third (1/3) of the GAR score for a
   lot.

   3402.5. If multiple landscape elements occupy the same area, for example
   groundcover under a tree or trees and shrubs on an intensive green roof, the
   full square footage or equivalent square footage of each element may be
   counted.

   3402.6. A landscape element must meet the eligibility conditions of § 3403.

   3402.7. Equivalent square feet of tree canopy and large shrubs are identified
   in the table below.

   Tree canopy for trees  6 inches to 12 inches in diameter
   
   250 s.f. per tree
   
   
   
   Tree canopy for trees  12 inches to 18 inches in diameter
   
   600 s.f. per tree
   
   
   
   Tree canopy for trees 18 inches to 24 inches in diameter
   
   1300 s.f. per tree
   
   
   
   Tree canopy for trees larger than 24 inches in diameter
   
   2000 s.f. per tree

   3402.8. Landscape elements of the GAR shall be measured in the following ways:
   
   All trees shall be measured for diameter at a height four feet, six inches (4
   ft. 6 in.) above grade when planted and the square footage equivalent based on
   diameter shall be as established in the table in § 3402.7;
   
   
   
   
   
   For vegetated walls, use the vertical square footage of the portion of the
   wall covered by vegetation; and
   
   
   
   
   
   For all other elements other than trees, large shrubs, perennials, and
   vegetated walls, square footage is determined by the area of a horizontal
   plane that is over the element.
