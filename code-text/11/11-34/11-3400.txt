INTRODUCTION TO GREEN AREA RATIO (§ 11-3400)

Green Area Ratio (GAR) is the ratio of the weighted value of landscape elements
to land area.  The GAR score relates to an increase in the quantity and quality
of environmental performance of the urban landscape. 





 	Green Area Ratio sets integrated environmental requirements for landscape
elements and site design that contribute to the reduction of stormwater runoff,
the improvement of air quality, and the mitigation of the urban heat island
effect. 





 	The purposes of the GAR regulations are to:

Implement a value-based system of requirements for environmental site design
that provides flexibility in meeting environmental performance standards; and





Promote attractive and environmentally functional landscapes.





	The purpose of this chapter is to:

Provide general guidance about the regulation of GAR requirements;





Define the applicability of GAR;





Set forth the formula for calculating the GAR and define its component parts;





Identify those landscape elements that are included in the GAR, explain how
their area is measured, and set forth eligibility conditions;





Establish multipliers for each eligible landscape element; 





Indicate what plans and certifications must accompany an application submitted
to demonstrate proof of GAR compliance; and





Establish maintenance requirements for the landscape elements that are provided
as part of a property’s GAR requirement.
