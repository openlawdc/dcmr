MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR GREEN AREA RATIO (§ 11-3406)

3406.1. All plantings and landscape elements used to calculate a property’s
   GAR must be maintained for the life of the project.  If, for any reason, the
   installed landscape elements fall below the minimum required GAR score, new
   eligible landscape elements shall be added to compensate and result in the
   required ratio. These elements are not required to be the same as the
   submitted plans, so long as the GAR achieved is equivalent.
