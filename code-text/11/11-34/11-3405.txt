SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS FOR GREEN AREA RATIO (ยง 11-3405)

3405.1. The Board of Zoning Adjustment may grant, by special exception, a full
   or partial reduction in the GAR required under this chapter if, in addition to
   meeting the general requirements of ยง 3104, the applicant demonstrates that
   providing the GAR is impractical as a result of equivalent sustainability
   measures already being implemented on the property that achieve the intent of
   the GAR through methods not available through the GAR requirement.
