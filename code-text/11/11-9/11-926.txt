PARKING SPACES (W-0) (ยง 11-926)

926.1. Notwithstanding ยง 2116.1. of this Title, parking spaces for
   boathouses, marinas, yacht clubs, or other recreational uses to be located
   elsewhere than on the same lot or part of the lot on which the principal use
   is located, may be permitted as a special exception, if the applicant proves
   that compliance with this parking requirement would be unsafe or economically
   impractical and:
   
   
   
   (a)	The parking spaces will be located to furnish reasonable and convenient
   parking for patrons of the principal building;
   
   
   
   (b)	Any support facility in relation to the parking spaces is designed so as
   not likely to become objectionable to adjoining or nearby property, park
   space, or the waterfront because of noise, traffic, or other objectionable
   conditions;
   
   
   
   (c)	The parking spaces will be adequately screened from adjacent park space
   and from the waterfront, and shall be designed to prevent storm water run-off
   directly into the river; and
   
   
   
   (d)	All other requirements of Chapter 21 will be met.

   926.2. The applicant shall prove that compliance would be unsafe or
   economically impractical by showing that one or more of the following applies:
   
   
   
   (a)	The lack of street frontage or the separation of the use from any
   publicly- accessible street by public park space;
   
   
   
   (b)	Unusual topography, grades, shape, size, or dimensions of the lot;
   
   
   
   (c)	The lack of appropriate ingress or egress through existing or proposed
   streets;
   
   
   
   (d)	Strip zoning or shallow zoning depth;
   
   
   
   (e)	Restricted size of lot caused by adverse adjoining ownership or
   substantial improvements adjoining or on the lot; or
   
   
   
   (f)	Traffic hazards caused by unusual street grades or other conditions.

   926.3. All or a portion of required parking spaces for a boathouse may be
   reduced or eliminated by special exception if the applicant proves that:
   
   
   
   (a)	The provision of parking would result in significant adverse impacts on
   adjacent park land;
   
   
   
   (b)	The type or location of the associated principal use results in diminished
   need for parking from what would otherwise be required by zoning regulations;
   or
   
   
   
   (c)	Reasonable and conveniently-located alternatives to the required parking
   exist and are available to the boathouse users with minimal impact on adjacent
   land or development.
