                                  DC REGULATIONS

GENERAL PROVISIONS[COLON] WATERFRONT DISTRICTS (§ 11-900)

900.1. The Waterfront (W) Districts are applied to waterfront areas that have
   one (1) or more of the following characteristics:
   
   (a)	Geographically, historically, or locationally unique;
   
   
   
   (b)	Adjacent to well-established residential areas;
   
   
   
   (c)	Undergoing transition from light and heavy industrial uses to office and
   commercial uses; or
   
   
   
   (d)	Where the public health, safety, general welfare, and amenity would be
   promoted and protected by the encouragement of mixed uses.

   900.2. The Waterfront District shall be subdivided into W-0, W-1, W-2, and W-3
   Districts.

   900.3. The W-0 District permits open space, park, and low-density and
   low-height waterfront-oriented retail and arts uses, the W-1 District permits
   a moderate height and density, the W-2 District allows a medium height and
   density, and the W-3 District allows the greatest height and density of the
   Waterfront Districts.

   900.4. The purpose of the Waterfront Districts is to encourage a diversity of
   compatible land uses at various densities, including combinations of
   residential, offices, retail, recreational, arts and cultural, and other
   miscellaneous uses.

   900.5. The W-1, W-2, and W-3 Districts are also intended to be relatively
   self-contained by supplying a variety of housing, service, employment, and
   recreational opportunities in one (1) location. This characteristic allows one
   (1) area to serve many different needs of a single population and to thereby
   reduce the amount of vehicular traffic generated by the uses in the districts.

   900.6. The W-0 District is intended to provide waterfront recreation areas
   with related waterfront-oriented or waterfront-enhancing uses, to serve local
   and regional open space recreation needs.

   900.7. Except as provided in chapter 21 of this title, in the Waterfront
   Districts, no building or premises shall be used and no building shall be
   erected or altered that is arranged, intended, or designed to be used except
   as specified in §§ 901, 902, and 906 through 925.
