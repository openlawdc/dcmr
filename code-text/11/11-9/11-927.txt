SPECIAL EXCEPTION REVIEW CRITERIA (W-0) (ยง 11-927)

927.1. In addition to proving that the proposed use meets all specific special
   exception criteria applicable to it as well as the general criteria set forth
   in ยง 3104, the applicant shall also demonstrate that:
   
   
   
   (a)	The buildings, structures, and uses will enhance the visual and public
   recreational opportunities offered along the waterfront;
   
   
   
   (b)	Buildings, structures, and uses on land will be located and designed to
   minimize adverse impacts on the river and riverbank areas;
   
   
   
   (c)	If the proposed use is a boathouse, marina, or yacht club, the buildings
   will be located entirely on shore directly in front of berths, separated only
   by the setback area described in ยง 938, unless doing so would result in an
   infeasible project and would hinder furtherance of the objectives of the W-0
   District;
   
   
   
   (d)	Buildings, structures, and uses on, under, or over water will be located
   and designed to minimize adverse impacts on the river and riverbank areas;
   
   
   
   (e)	All structures and buildings will be located so as not likely to become
   objectionable to surrounding and nearby property because of noise, traffic, or
   parking, and so as not to limit public access along or to the waterfront,
   other than directly in front of the principal building or structure of a
   boathouse, marina, or yacht club;
   
   
   
   (f)	Impervious surfaces will be minimized, and buildings, structures, and
   other uses will be designed and sited to minimize potential for surface storm
   water run-off directly into the river;
   
   
   
   (g)	Screening, coping, setbacks, fences, the location of entrances and exits,
   or any other consideration for accessory or non-accessory parking spaces will
   be designed to screen and protect adjacent parkland and the waterfront; and
   
   
   
   (h)	Emergency access will be provided to any buildings, structures, or other
   space devoted to active public use.
