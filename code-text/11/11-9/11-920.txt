                                  DC REGULATIONS

USES SUBJECT TO SPECIAL EXCEPTION (W-0) &#8211; GENERAL PROVISIONS (§ 11-920)

920.1. The uses described in §§ 921 through 925 are permitted if approved as
   special exceptions in the W-0 District.

   920.2. Except as provided in § 920.3, applications for special exceptions
   within the W-0 District shall be heard by the Board of Zoning Adjustment.

   920.3. As part of its consideration of a petition or application to zone a
   property or properties to the W-0 District, the Zoning Commission may also
   review special exceptions (whether authorized in this chapter or elsewhere in
   this Title) and variance requests for the subject properties simultaneously
   with the zoning map amendment application. The Commission&#8217;s rules of
   procedure shall apply to such reviews.

   920.4. At the time of filing an application with the Commission, the applicant
   shall pay the filing fee specified in § 3180.1(b)(16) plus such fees as apply
   to any additional zoning relief requested. The provisions of § 3181 relating
   to the administration of fees shall apply, except that the applicant may
   appeal any decision of the Director regarding the fee schedule to the
   Commission, which shall decide the appeal at a meeting or hearing as a
   preliminary matter to hearing the application.

   920.5. With respect to any special exception use under consideration, the
   Commission may authorize the following if the applicant is able to demonstrate
   that application of normally applied zoning regulations would result in an
   infeasible project and would hinder furtherance of the objectives of the
   Waterfront District:
   
   
   
   (a)	An increase of not more than five percent (5%) in the maximum lot
   occupancy, height, or floor area ratio as otherwise prescribed in this Title.
   The Commission shall have the option to approve a greater increase if the
   subject property is surrounded by National Park Service lands; or
   
   
   
   (b)	A reduction of not more than five percent (5%) of the minimum yard or
   court requirements as otherwise prescribed in this Title. The Commission shall
   have the option to approve a greater decrease if the subject property is
   surrounded by National Park Service lands.
