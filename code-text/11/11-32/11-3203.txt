3203.1. Except as provided in §§ 3203.7, 3203.8, 3203.9, or the second
   sentence of this subsection, no person shall use any structure, land, or part
   of any structure or land for any purpose until a certificate of occupancy has
   been issued to that person stating that the use complies with the provisions
   of this title and the D.C. Construction Code, Title 12 DCMR. The requirements
   of this subsection shall not apply to:
   
   
   
   (a)	A one-family dwelling; or
   
   
   
   (b)	A community based residential facility to be occupied by six or fewer
   persons with a handicap plus resident supervisors, as permitted by right in
   residence and commercial districts pursuant 11 DCMR §§ 201.1 (f) and 330.5
   (d).

   3203.2. Certificates of occupancy shall not be required for separate

   certificate of occupancy is issued for the entire structure.

   3203.3. Except in the case of a church, all certificates of occupancy shall be
   conspicuously posted in or upon the premises to which they apply so that they
   may be seen readily by anyone entering the premises.

   3203.4. If the erection or alteration of a structure is contemplated, a
   certificate of occupancy for that structure shall not be issued until the
   erection or alteration is completed to the point of availability of occupancy
   for use, except as provided in § 3203.5.

   3203.5. Where an alteration to a structure is required by law in order to
   effect compliance with regulations adopted pursuant to the Means of Egress

   §§ 6-703.03 to 6-703.09 (2001)(formerly codified at D.C. Code §§ 5-518 to
   5-524 (1994 Repl.))), a certificate of occupancy for that structure may be
   issued prior to the alteration; Provided, that the use of the structure for
   which a certificate of occupancy is desired, if a new use, is not one that
   would require a greater amount of egress or fire protection facilities under
   the Means of Egress Law than is required for the use existing prior to the
   alteration.

   3203.6. Any certificate of occupancy issued under the terms of §§ 3203.4 or
   3203.5 shall be subject to compliance with regulations adopted pursuant to the
   Means of Egress Law.

   Zoning Commission has pending before it a proceeding to consider an amendment
   of the zone district classification of the site of the proposed use, the
   processing of the application, and the establishment of the occupancy, shall
   be governed as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	If the application is filed on or before the date on which the Zoning
   Commission makes a decision to hold a hearing on the amendment, the processing
   of the application and completion of the work shall be governed by § 3203.8;
   
   
   
   (b)	Except as otherwise provided in § 3203.11, if the application is filed
   after the date on which the Zoning Commission has made a decision to hold a
   hearing on the amendment, the application may be processed, and any use
   authorized by the certificate of occupancy may be established and maintained
   only in accordance with the most restrictive provision of the zone district
   classifications being considered for the site or in accordance with the zone
   district classifications of the site pursuant to the final decision of the
   Zoning Commission in the proceeding;
   
   
   
   (c)	For purposes of paragraph (b) of this subsection, the phrase &#8220;zone

   any zone district classification that the Zoning Commission has decided to
   notice for adoption and the zone district classification that is in effect on
   the date the application is filed;
   
   
   
   (d)	The limitation in paragraph (b) of this subsection shall not apply to a
   decision to hold a hearing on an application to amend the Zoning Regulations
   or Zoning Maps filed by an owner of property pursuant to § 102.2(a) of this
   title; and
   
   
   
   (e)	The limitation in paragraph (b) of this subsection shall not apply to an
   application for a certificate of occupancy that only changes the identity of
   the owner or occupant and that does not change a use authorized by a
   certificate of occupancy that was issued either before the decision to hold a
   hearing on the amendment or pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection.

   3203.8. Any use that is authorized by a certificate of occupancy may be

   use classification that is established by this title;
   
   
   
   (b)	The use shall be established within six (6) months of the date on which
   the certificate is issued; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Any amendment of the use authorized by the certificate shall comply with
   the provisions of this title in effect on the date that the certificate is
   amended.

   3203.9. Applications for certificates of occupancy authorized by orders of the
   Board of Zoning Adjustment may be processed in accordance with the Zoning
   Regulations in effect on the date the orders were promulgated; provided, that

   change or deviation.

   3203.10. Certificates of occupancy issued in accordance with §§ 3203.7,

   the use is dependent upon the erection, construction, conversion, or

   application for the building permit on which the use depends;
   
   
   
   (b)	A building permit shall be issued in compliance with § 3202;
