                                  DC REGULATIONS

ACCESSORY PARKING SPACES (R-1) (ยง 11-214)

214.1. Accessory passenger automobile parking spaces elsewhere than on the
   same lot or part of a lot on which any principal R-1 use is permitted, except
   for a one-family dwelling, shall be permitted as a special exception in an R-1
   District if approved by the Board of Zoning Adjustment under ยง 3104, subject
   to the provisions of this section.

   214.2. Accessory parking spaces shall be in an open area or in an underground
   garage no portion of which, except for access, shall extend above the level of
   the adjacent finished grade.

   214.3. Accessory parking spaces shall be located in their entirety within two
   hundred feet (200 ft.) of the area to which they are accessory.

   214.4. Accessory parking spaces shall be contiguous to or separated only by an
   alley from the use to which they are accessory.

   214.5. All provisions of chapter 23 of this title regulating parking lots
   shall be complied with, except that the Board may in an appropriate case under
   ยง 2303.3 modify or waive the conditions specified in ยง 2303.2 where
   compliance would serve no useful purpose.

   214.6. It shall be deemed economically impracticable or unsafe to locate
   accessory parking spaces within the principal building or on the same lot on
   which the building or use is permitted because of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Strip zoning or shallow zoning depth;
   
   
   
   (b)	Restricted size of lot caused by adverse adjoining ownership or
   substantial improvements adjoining or on the lot;
   
   
   
   (c)	Unusual topography grades, shape, size, or dimensions of the lot;
   
   
   
   (d)	The lack of an alley or the lack of appropriate ingress or egress through
   existing or proposed alleys or streets; or
   
   
   
   (e)	Traffic hazards caused by unusual street grades or other conditions.

   214.7. Accessory parking spaces shall be so located, and facilities in
   relation to the parking lot shall be so designed, that they are not likely to
   become objectionable to adjoining or nearby property because of noise,
   traffic, or other objectionable conditions.

   214.8. Before taking final action on an application for use as an accessory
   parking space, the Board shall submit the application to the D.C. Department
   of Transportation for review and report.
