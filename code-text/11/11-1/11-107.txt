                                  DC REGULATIONS

ZONE DISTRICT BOUNDARY LINES (§ 11-107)

107.1. The zone district boundaries shall be shown on each section of the
   Zoning Map.

   107.2. The scale of the Zoning Map and the dimensions entered on the map shall
   be shown on each section of the map to serve as guides.

   107.3. Dimensioned district boundaries showing on the Zoning Map are intended
   to coincide generally with lot lines. Where a dimensional boundary line
   coincides within one foot (1 ft.) or less with a lot line of a lot of record
   on May 12, 1958, that boundary line shall be construed to be the lot line at
   that location.

   107.4. Whenever a portion of any district is indicated as a strip paralleling
   an opened or unopened street, the width of this strip, unless delimited by lot
   lines or otherwise dimensioned, shall be assumed to be one hundred feet (100
   ft.) measured at a right angle from the nearest street to which it is parallel
   and adjacent.

   107.5. In all other cases, the zone district boundary lines shall be intended
   to follow existing lot lines, the center lines of streets, alleys (including
   any closed streets or alleys not previously zoned), and natural water courses.

   107.6. In the case of tidal water areas, the zone district boundary shall be
   either the mean high water level or the established pierhead lines, whichever
   gives the greatest control.

   107.7. In cases of disagreement or uncertainty existing as to the exact
   location of a zone district boundary line, the Board of Zoning Adjustment,
   upon appeal filed in accordance with §§ 3100.2 and 3112, shall determine the
   exact location of the boundary.

   107.8. When a zone district boundary line divides a lot that was in single
   ownership on May 12, 1958, the permitted use, height, density, or bulk of a
   structure located on that lot may be determined by § 2514.
