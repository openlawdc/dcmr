                                  DC REGULATIONS

R-4 DISTRICTS[COLON] GENERAL PROVISIONS (§ 11-330)

330.1. The R-4 District is designed to include those areas now developed
   primarily with row dwellings, but within which there have been a substantial
   number of conversions of the dwellings into dwellings for two (2) or more
   families.

   330.2. Very little vacant land shall be included within the R-4 District,
   since its primary purpose shall be the stabilization of remaining one-family
   dwellings.

   330.3. The R-4 District shall not be an apartment house district as
   contemplated under the General Residence (R-5) Districts, since the conversion
   of existing structures shall be controlled by a minimum lot area per family
   requirement.

   330.4. Except as provided in chapters 20 through 25 of this title, in an R-4
   District, no building or premises shall be used and no building shall be
   erected or altered that is arranged, intended, or designed to be used except
   for one (1) or more of the uses listed in §§ 330 through 349.

   330.5. The following uses shall be permitted as a matter of right in an R-4
   District:
   
   
   
   (a)	Any use permitted in R-3 Districts under § 320.3;
   
   
   
   (b)	Child/Elderly development center located in a building that was built as a
   church and that has been used continuously as a church since it was built;
   provided, that all of the play space required for the center by the licensing
   regulations shall be located on the same lot on which the center is located;
   
   
   
   (c)	Child/Elderly development center or adult day treatment facility;
   provided, that the center shall be limited to no more than sixteen (16)
   individuals;
   
   
   
   (d)	Community-based residential facility; provided that, notwithstanding any
   provision in this title to the contrary, the Zoning Administrator has
   determined that such community-based residential facility, that otherwise
   complies with the zoning requirements of this title that are of general and
   uniform applicability to all matter-of-right uses in an R-4 District, is
   intended to be operated as housing for persons with handicaps. For purposes of
   this subsection, a &#8220;handicap&#8221; means, with respect to a person, a
   physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such
   person&#8217;s major life activities, or a record of having, or being regarded
   as having, such an impairment, but such item does not include current, illegal
   use of, or addiction to, a controlled substance
   
   
   
   (e)	The conversion of a building or other structure existing before May 12,
   1958, to an apartment house as limited by §§ 401.3 and 403.2
   
   
   
   (f)	Flat;
   
   
   
   (g)	Hospital, sanitarium, or clinic for humans;

   except when the use is a service customarily carried on as a business.

   330.6. A rooming or boarding house shall be permitted as a matter of right in
   an R-4 District; provided:
   
   
   
   (a)	Accommodations are not provided to transient guests who stay ninety (90)
   days or less at the premises;
   
   
   
   (b)	No sign is displayed on the premises;
   
   
   
   (c)	No advertisement is displayed or published on or off the premises holding
   out the establishment to be a hotel, motel, inn, hostel, bed and breakfast,
   private club, tourist home, guest house, or other transient accommodation;
   
   
   
   (d)	Cooking facilities are not provided in any individual unit; and
