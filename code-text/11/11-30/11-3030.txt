CONSENT CALENDAR (ยง 11-3030)

3030.1. The purpose of this section is to create an expedited procedure to be
   known as the &#8220;Consent Calendar.&#8221; The procedure shall allow the
   Commission, in the interest of efficiency, to make, without public hearing,
   minor modifications and technical corrections to previously approved final
   orders, rulemaking, or other actions of the Commission, including corrections
   of inadvertent mistakes.

   3030.2. For purposes of this section, &#8220;minor modifications&#8221; shall
   mean modifications of little or no importance or consequence.

   3030.3. Any party to a proceeding before the Commission, or the Commission
   upon its own motion, may request that a matter be placed on the Consent
   Calendar.

   3030.4. The request shall be in writing; state the nature of, and reasons, and
   grounds for the minor modification or technical correction; and include a copy
   of any Commission final order, map, plan, rulemaking, or other action or
   relief proposed to be modified or corrected.

   3030.5. All written requests for placement of a matter on the Consent Calendar
   shall be made to the Director.

   3030.6. All written requests shall be served by the moving party on all
   parties in the original proceeding at the same time that the request is served
   on the Director.

   3030.7. The Director shall, in the Director&#8217;s sole discretion, determine
   the appropriate form of public notice and any additional service, taking into
   account the nature of the request and any issues relating to efficiency and
   fairness.

   3030.8. Within seven (7) days after a request to put a matter on the Consent
   Calendar has been filed and served, any other party may file a response in
   opposition to or in support of the request. The responding party shall serve
   all other parties at the time that the response is filed with the Office of
   Zoning.

   3030.9. The Director shall provide written comments and recommendations to the
   Commission on each request for placement of a matter on the Consent Calendar.

   3030.10. In reviewing requests for placement of a matter on the Consent
   Calendar, the Director may request advice from other District agencies,
   including the Office of the Attorney General.

   3030.11. Based upon the written request for placement of a matter on the
   Consent Calendar, all supporting and opposing submissions and the reports of
   other District of Columbia agencies, the Director shall determine which
   matters shall be placed on the Consent Calendar for consideration and action
   by the Commission without public hearing at its monthly meeting.

   3030.12. Any member of the Commission may remove any item from the Consent
   Calendar for any reason. Any matter that is not placed on the Consent Calendar
   or that is removed from the Consent Calendar shall be acted upon by the
   Commission according to the applicable procedures contained in other sections
   of this chapter.

   3030.13. All relief granted by the Commission under this section shall be
   consistent with the intent of the Commission in approving its original order,
   map, plan, rulemaking, or other action or relief proposed to be modified or
   corrected and shall not substantially impair the intent, purpose, or integrity
   of the zone plan as embodied in the Zoning Regulations and Zoning Map.
