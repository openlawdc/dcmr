                                  DC REGULATIONS

APPLICATIONS AND PETITIONS (§ 11-3010)

3010.1. Any proceeding before the Commission shall be initiated by the filing
   of an application or petition with the Commission on the form and in the
   number that the Commission may prescribe, except that the Commission may
   initiate a case on its own motion.

   3010.2. Contested cases are adjudicatory in nature; present issues for
   resolution at a public hearing that potentially will affect a relatively small
   number of persons or properties; and involve primarily questions of fact
   applicable to a small number of persons or properties, while broader issues of
   public policy are secondary concerns. Contested cases include, without
   limitation, the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Planned unit developments filed according to chapter 24 of this title;
   
   
   
   (b)	Requests for zoning map amendments filed by the property owner or owners
   for a single property or for multiple properties that are contiguous or are
   only separated by a street or alley;
   
   
   
   (c)	Applications for air space development; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Applications for Zoning Commission review and approval pursuant to
   chapters 16, 18, 28, and 29 of this title, as well as § 1709.21.

   3010.3. Contested cases shall be initiated by the filing of an application.
   Public hearings on a contested case shall be processed and conducted according
   to the D.C. Administrative Procedure Act, D.C. Official Code § 2-509 (2001)
   (formerly codified at D.C. Code § 1-1509 (1999 Repl.)), and § 3022 of this
   chapter, unless the Commission determines otherwise pursuant to § 3010.7.

   3010.4. Rulemaking cases are cases that are legislative in nature and cases in
   which the issues to be resolved at the public hearing may affect large numbers
   of persons or property or the public in general, including:
   
   
   
   (a)	A zoning text or map amendment that is proposed in furtherance of the
   Comprehensive Plan or other public law or policy;
   
   
   
   (b)	Cases in which the primary issues involve land use and urban planning and
   zoning policies, such as the development pattern of the city or a particular
   geographic area, population density, distribution of employment centers,
   traffic and transportation patterns, and related matters; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Cases in which the facts, information, and opinions sought for the public
   hearing are to come from a wide cross-section of the public.

   3010.5. Rulemaking cases include:
   
   
   
   (a)	Proposals to amend the text of the Zoning Regulations;
   
   
   
   (b)	Proposals initiated by public agencies to amend the zoning map for a
   neighborhood, commercial district, or other geographic area encompassing
   multiple properties, unless determined otherwise by the Commission pursuant to
   § 3010.7; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Proposals initiated by private persons, organizations, or other entities
   to amend the zoning map in cases where:
   
   
   
   (1)	The petitioner does not own all of the property proposed to be rezoned; or
   
   
   
   (2)	The petitioner owns all of the property proposed to be rezoned, but the
   ownership pattern is geographically scattered or otherwise of a character that
   raises land use policy questions to a greater degree than highly localized
   issues of fact and effects on neighboring properties.

   3010.6. Rulemaking cases are initiated by the filing of a petition. Public
   hearings shall be processed and conducted according to the provisions of §
   3021, unless the Commission determines otherwise pursuant to § 3010.7.

   3010.7. Notwithstanding the classifications of cases in §§ 3010.2 and
   3010.5, the Commission may, on its own motion or at the request of any person,
   review and determine the designation of such case as a contested case or a
   rulemaking case based on the standards contained in §§ 3010.2 and 3010.4.

   3010.8. A proceeding that is a contested case within the meaning of D.C.
   Official Code § 2-502(8) (2001)(formerly codified at D.C. Code § 1-1502(8))
   (1999 Repl.)), shall be conducted pursuant to the requirements of the D.C.
   Administrative Procedure Act.
