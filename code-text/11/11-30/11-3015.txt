   3015.4. When a Zoning Map amendment, planned unit development, air space
   development, or Zoning Commission review and approval pursuant to chapters 16,
   18, 28, and 29 of this title is requested by a property owner for the property
   owned, the applicant shall give additional notice of the public hearing by
   posting the property with notice of hearing at least forty (40) days in
   advance of the hearing.

   applicant&#8217;s property shall be posted in plain view of the public at each
   street frontage on the property and on the front of each existing building
   located on the subject property.

   and shall show the:

   swear or affirm at the hearing that this has been done.

   3015.10. Notice of the public hearing pursuant to § 3015.3 shall not be a
   jurisdictional prerequisite to action by the Commission. It shall be intended
   to offer supplemental notice only.

   3015.11. If a failure of notice under § 3015.3 is alleged and proven, the
   Commission may consider all the surrounding circumstances, including the
   extent of actual notice received by the public from all sources, attendance at
   the public hearing, and the nature and extent of the proposed construction and
   use under the application, if approved. On the basis of these considerations,
   the Commission may determine whether the public hearing will be postponed,
   continued, or held as scheduled.
