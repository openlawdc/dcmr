RECONSIDERATION AND REFILING (ยง 11-3029)

3029.1. Requests for reconsideration of an application or petition dismissed
   without a hearing shall not be entertained.

   3029.2. No application or petition essentially the same as that dismissed
   without a hearing shall be accepted for filing within six (6) months after
   dismissal; provided, that an application or petition dismissed without
   prejudice may be refiled at the convenience of the applicant or petitioner.

   3029.3. An application or petition may be withdrawn prior to advertisement of
   a hearing. Following advertisement, an application or petition may be
   withdrawn only with the consent of the Commission. In either case, an
   application or petition shall not be accepted for refiling within six (6)
   months after the withdrawal.

   3029.4. No application or petition essentially the same as that denied
   following a hearing shall be accepted for filing within one (1) year after
   denial.

   3029.5. A motion for reconsideration, rehearing, or re-argument of a final
   order in a contested case under ยง 3022 may be filed by a party within ten
   (10) days of the order having become final. The motion shall be served upon
   all other parties. The Commission shall not receive or consider any motion for
   reconsideration, rehearing, or re-argument of a final order in a contested
   case proceeding that is filed prior to the order having become final.

   3029.6. A motion for reconsideration, rehearing, or re-argument shall state
   specifically the respects in which the final order is claimed to be erroneous,
   the grounds of the motion, and the relief sought.  No request for rehearing
   shall be considered by the Commission unless new evidence is submitted that
   could not reasonably have been presented at the original hearing. If a
   rehearing is granted, notice shall be given as in the case of an original
   hearing.

   3029.7. Within seven (7) days after a motion has been filed and served, any
   other party may file an answer in opposition to or in support of the motion.

   3029.8. Neither the filing nor the granting of the motion shall stay a
   decision unless the Commission orders otherwise.

   3029.9. A motion for reconsideration, rehearing, or re-argument shall not be a
   prerequisite to judicial review.

   3029.10. A motion for reconsideration, rehearing, or re-argument of a final
   order in a rulemaking under ยง 3021 shall not be accepted or considered,
   except that a member of the Commission may initiate a motion for
   reconsideration up to thirty-five (35) days after the vote on the final
   action.
