                                  DC REGULATIONS

REVIEW AND PROCESSING OF APPLICATIONS AND PETITIONS (§ 11-3011)

3011.1. Except as provided in § 2523.4, as soon as an application or petition
   is accepted for filing by the Director of the Office of Zoning, the Director
   shall place a copy of the application or petition in the public record of the
   Commission and refer a copy to the D.C. Office of Planning for review and
   recommendation on whether the matter should be processed further, except that
   the applications for Zoning Commission review and approval filed pursuant to
   chapters 16, 18, 28, and 29 of this title, which are deemed complete by the
   Director, shall be immediately scheduled for hearing consistent with the
   notice provisions of this chapter. The exception from the requirements of this
   subsection shall not apply to an application for Zoning Commission approval
   pursuant to § 1612 unless accompanied by a written report of the Office of
   Planning certifying that the application is compliant with the standards of
   that section.

   3011.2. The report of the Office of Planning on whether the matter should be
   set for public hearing shall be in writing and filed with the Director of the
   Office of Zoning at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting at which it is to
   be considered by the Commission, and forthwith shall be filed in the public
   records of the Commission.

   3011.3. After considering the application or petition and the recommendations
   of the Office of Planning, and after reasonable opportunity for the applicant
   or petitioner to present the applicant&#8217;s or petitioner&#8217;s views,
   the Commission may dismiss the application or petition or set it down for
   public hearing or other proceeding.

   3011.4. The vote of a majority of the full Commission shall be required to
   deny or dismiss an application or petition without a hearing. The vote of a
   majority of the members present may set the matter down for a public hearing
   or other proceeding.

   3011.5. If the matter is denied or dismissed without a public hearing, the
   Commission shall issue a dismissal order, copies of which shall be published
   in the D.C. Register, served on the applicant or petitioner, and provided to
   the public library system and to the appropriate locations. The order shall
   include a statement of reasons for the dismissal.

   3011.6. If the Commission denies or dismisses an application or petition
   without prejudice, the order shall also state the type of modification the
   Commission considers appropriate.

   3011.7. If the matter is set down for a public hearing, the Commission shall
   at the same meeting:
   
   
   
   (a)	Confirm whether the matter will be heard as a contested or rulemaking case
   according to the standards in § 3010 and provide that the notice of hearing
   will state such classification;
   
   
   
   (b)	Schedule the date or dates for the public hearing, providing for an
   adequate number of public hearing sessions within a short time span, taking
   into account the nature and complexity of the case as presented in the report
   of the Office of Planning and any additional comments by the Office of
   Planning or the Director of the Office of Zoning; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Make every effort to expedite cases regarding which the Office of Planning
   report and comments at the meeting suggest that:
   
   
   
   (1)	The case has substantial merit in the public interest;
   
   
   
   (2)	The issues in the case are relatively straight forward, and few if any
   modifications to the proposal are likely to be necessary; and
   
   
   
   (3)	Little or no opposition has yet appeared, and the concerns at this
   preliminary stage appear to be capable of resolution in an expedited
   processing.

   3011.8. In expediting certain cases as provided in § 3011.7(c), the
   Commission shall ensure that large or more complex cases of great import to
   the public interest are not delayed or are only delayed to a minor degree.

   3011.9. An applicant or petitioner granted a public hearing and other
   processing shall be so notified and informed of any other requirements of the
   Commission.
