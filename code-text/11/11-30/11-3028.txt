                                  DC REGULATIONS

FINAL ACTION (§ 11-3028)

3028.1. In a rulemaking under § 3021, to take final action to amend the text
   of the Zoning Regulations or the Zoning Map, the Commission may proceed
   following receipt of the report of the National Capital Planning Commission or
   after thirty (30) days of the referral required under § 3025, whichever is
   sooner; provided, that in no case shall the Commission take final action
   sooner than thirty (30) days after publication of the proposed rulemaking in
   the D.C. Register.

   3028.2. In a rulemaking under § 3021, to take final action that does not
   amend the text of the Zoning Regulations or the Zoning Map, the Commission may
   proceed without referral to or report from the National Capital Planning
   Commission and without publication of proposed rulemaking in the D.C.
   Register.

   3028.3. In a contested case under § 3022, to take final action to amend the
   Zoning Map or to approve planned unit development or air space development,
   the Commission may proceed following receipt of the report from the National
   Capital Planning Commission or after thirty (30) days of the referral required
   under § 3025, whichever is sooner.

   3028.4. To take final action that does not amend the Zoning Map or that denies
   a planned unit development, the Commission may proceed without a referral to
   or report from the National Capital Planning Commission.

   3028.5. The Commission shall issue its written order on an application or
   petition no later than forty-five (45) days after the Commission&#8217;s vote
   to take final action on the application or petition.

   3028.6. The final action of the Commission on an application or petition shall
   be in the form of a written order that shall be filed in the record.

   3028.7. In a rulemaking proceeding under § 3021, the order shall be published
   in the D.C. Register as a final rulemaking action.

   3028.8. In a contested case under § 3022, the order shall be accompanied by
   findings of fact and conclusions of law. The order shall be published in the
   D.C. Register. Prior to publication in the D.C. Register, copies of the order
   shall be served on any party who appeared and participated in the hearing in
   person or by authorized representative.

   3028.9. A written order setting forth a final action shall become final and
   effective upon publication in the D.C. Register, unless the Commission
   specifies a later effective date. An amendment to the Zoning Map approved in
   connection with an application for a planned unit development shall, however,
   become effective only upon completion of the process required by chapter 24 of
   this title, and upon filing with the District of Columbia a covenant ensuring
   compliance with approved plans.
