2200.1. All buildings or structures erected on or after May 12, 1958 shall be
   provided with loading berths, loading platforms, and service/delivery loading
   spaces to the extent specified in § 2201, except as provided in § 2202 and
   for structures erected on Kingman and Heritage Islands for which the
   construction of service delivery loading spaces shall be prohibited.

   2200.2. No application for a building permit for a building or structure to be
   erected on or after May 12, 1958 shall be approved unless there is included
   with the plans for the building or structure a loading plan showing the
   location, dimensions, and grades of all loading berths, loading platforms, and
   service/delivery loading spaces and approaches thereto in accordance with the
   provisions of this chapter.

   2200.3. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for the use of a building
   or structure erected on or after May 12, 1958, unless the required loading
   berths, loading platforms, and service/delivery loading spaces have been
   provided in accordance with the loading plan provided for in the approved
   building permit.

   2200.4. Except as provided in § 2200.5, when the use of a building or
   structure is changed to another use that requires more loading berths, loading
   platforms, or service/delivery loading spaces than required for the use
   existing immediately prior to the change or, if the building or structure is
   vacant, the use that existed immediately prior to the vacancy, loading berths,
   loading platforms, and service/delivery loading spaces shall be provided for
   the additional requirement in the amount necessary to conform to § 2201.

   2200.5. No additional loading berths, loading platforms, or service/delivery
   loading spaces shall be required for a historic landmark or a building or
   structure located in a historic district that is certified by the State
   Historic Preservation Officer as contributing to the character of that
   historic district.

   2200.6. When the intensity of use of a building or structure existing before
   May 12, 1958 is increased by an addition or additions of dwelling units, gross
   floor area, seating capacity, or other unit of measurement specified in §
   2201, loading berths, loading platforms, and service/delivery loading spaces
   shall be provided for the addition or additions; provided, that the provisions
   of §§ 2200.7 through 2200.9 are satisfied.

   2200.7. Loading berths, loading platforms, and service/delivery loading spaces
   shall not be required for the addition or additions unless the addition or
   additions increase the intensity of use of the building or structure by more
   than twenty-five percent (25%) of the aggregate.

   2200.8. Loading berths, loading platforms, and service/delivery loading spaces
   for the addition of additions need not exceed the amount of loading berths,
   loading platforms, and service/delivery loading spaces that would be required
   for the entire structure as proposed if constructed new.

   2200.9. The determination of the increase of intensity of use shall be based
   on the total increase in intensity of use the structure undergoes on or after
   May 12, 1958, and whether the total increase occurs at one time or in
   successive stages.
