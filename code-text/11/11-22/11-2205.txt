2205.1. For the purpose of this chapter, the rules of interpretation in this
   section shall be applicable.

   2205.2. In computing the number of required loading berths, that portion of
   the gross floor area or cellar floor area devoted to any pump island canopy
   and kiosk adjacent to the pumps used exclusively as an attendant&#8217;s
   shelter of a gasoline service station, parking spaces, loading berths,
   service/delivery loading spaces, or loading platform area shall be excluded.

   2205.3. Except as provided in § 2203, in the case of mixed uses, the loading
   berths required shall be the sum of the requirements for the various
   individual uses computed separately in accordance with § 2201. At least one
   (1) loading berth shall be provided when the sum of the gross floor area of
   the separate uses exceeds the minimum gross floor area requiring loading
   berths for any one of the separate uses. Loading berths for one use shall not
   be considered as providing the required loading berths for any other use
   except as provided in § 2203.

   2205.4. No loading berths are required for buildings or structures with a
   gross floor area less than the minimum sizes specified in the schedule in §
   2201.
