                                  DC REGULATIONS

GENERAL PROVISIONS (ยง 11-2600)

2600.1. This Chapter establishes an Inclusionary Zoning Program that furthers
   the Housing Element of the Comprehensive Plan by increasing the amount and
   expanding the geographic distribution of adequate, affordable housing
   available to current and future residents.

   2600.2. It is the intent of the Zoning Commission to promulgate only such
   regulations as are necessary to establish the minimum obligations of property
   owners applying for building permits or certificates of occupancy under an
   Inclusionary Zoning Program. All other aspects of the program, including the
   setting of maximum purchase prices and rents, the minimum sizes of the units,
   the selection and obligations of eligible households, and the establishment of
   enforcement mechanisms such as covenants and certifications shall be as
   determined by the Council and Mayor of the District of Columbia.

   2600.3. The most important general purposes of the Inclusionary Zoning Program
   include the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	To utilize the skills and abilities of private developers to produce
   quality affordable housing;
   
   
   
   (b)	To leverage private development, combined where appropriate with zoning
   density increases, to produce affordable housing throughout the District of
   Columbia;
   
   
   
   (c)	To mitigate the impact of market-rate residential development on the
   availability and cost of housing available and affordable to low- and
   moderate-income households;
   
   
   
   (d)	To increase the production of affordable housing units throughout the
   District to meet existing and anticipated housing and employment needs;
   
   
   
   (e)	To provide for a full range of housing choices throughout the District for
   households of all incomes, sizes, and age ranges to preserve diversity and to
   ensure the benefits of economic integration for the residents of the District;
   
   
   
   (f)	To stabilize the overall burden of housing costs on low- and
   moderate-income households;
   
   
   
   (g)	To create a stock of housing that will be affordable to low- and
   moderate-income residents over a long term; and
   
   
   
   (h)	To make homeownership opportunities available to low- and moderate-income
   residents.
