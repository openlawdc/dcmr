AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE PARKING SPACES (§ 11-2100)

2100.1. All buildings or structures erected on or after May 12, 1958 shall be
   provided with parking spaces to the extent specified in § 2101, except as
   permitted by §§ 2102 through 2108 and for structures erected on Kingman and
   Heritage Islands for which the construction of parking spaces shall be
   prohibited except for handicap spaces.

   2100.2. No application for a building permit for a building or structure to be
   erected on or after May 12, 1958 shall be approved unless there is included
   with the plans for the building or structure a parking plan showing the
   location, dimensions, and grades of all parking spaces and approaches thereto
   in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

   2100.3. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for the use of a building
   or structure erected on or after May 12, 1958, unless the required parking
   spaces have been provided in accordance with the parking plan provided for in
   the approved building permit.

   2100.4. Except for historic resources as defined in § 2120.2, when the use of
   a building or structure is changed to another use that requires more parking
   spaces than required for the use existing immediately prior to the change or,
   if the building or structure is vacant, the use that existed immediately prior
   to the vacancy, parking spaces shall be provided for the additional
   requirement in the amount necessary to conform to § 2101.

   2100.5. [DELETED]

   2100.6. Except as provided in § 2120.3, when the intensity of use of a
   building or structure existing before May 12, 1958 is increased by an addition
   of employees, dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other
   unit of measurement specified in § 2101, parking spaces shall be provided for
   the addition, subject to §§ 2100.7 through 2100.9.

   2100.7. Parking spaces shall not be required for the addition unless the
   addition increases the intensity of use of the building or structure by more
   than twenty-five percent (25%) of the aggregate.

   2100.8. Parking spaces for the addition need not exceed the amount of parking
   spaces that would be required for the entire structure as proposed if
   constructed new.

   2100.9. The determination of the increase of intensity of use shall be based
   on the total increase in intensity of use the structure undergoes on or after
   May 12, 1958, whether the total increase occurs at one time or in successive
   stages.

   2100.10. In the case of a building or structure for which the Zoning
   Regulations now require more parking spaces than were required when the
   building or structure was built, the following shall be required:
   
   (a)	If the existing number of parking spaces now provided is less than or
   equal to the minimum number of parking spaces now required by this chapter,
   the number of parking spaces cannot be reduced; and
   
   
   
   (b)	If the existing number of parking spaces now provided is more than the
   minimum number of parking spaces now required by this chapter, the number of
   parking spaces cannot be reduced below the minimum number of parking spaces
   required by this chapter.
