SURFACE PARKING LOTS LANDCAPING STANDARDS (ยง 11-2111)

2111.1 	Surface parking areas with ten (10) or more parking spaces shall conform
to the landscaping, tree canopy cover, screening, and lighting requirements as
set forth in this section:





A minimum of ten percent (10%) of the total area devoted to parking, including
aisles and driveways shall be covered by landscaped areas planted with trees and
shrubs;





The landscaping shall be maintained in a healthy, growing condition; Dead or
dying landscaping shall be replaced;





All end islands of parking rows longer than nine (9) parking spaces, and all
areas otherwise not used for ingress and egress, aisles, and parking spaces
shall be landscaped;





Landscaping around the perimeter of the parking area may count toward the area
requirement of this subsection up to a distance of six feet (6 ft.) from the
pavement;





All newly planted trees shall have a minimum diameter of two and one-half inches
(2.5 in.); all trees shall be planted or retained in a space that provides a
minimum of five hundred (500) cubic feet of soil volume per tree; and





Trees shall be planted a minimum of four feet (4 ft.) from any protective
barrier, such as curbs or wheel stops with no horizontal dimension less than
four feet (4 ft.) and a minimum depth of three feet (3 ft.).



2111.2 	The Board of Zoning Adjustment may grant, by special exception, a full
or partial reduction in the landscape standards for parking lots required by
this section if, in addition to meeting the general requirements of ยง 3104, the
applicant demonstrates that complying with the landscape standards is
impractical because of size of lot, or other conditions relating to the lot or
surrounding area that would tend to make full compliance unduly restrictive,
prohibitively costly, or unreasonable.
