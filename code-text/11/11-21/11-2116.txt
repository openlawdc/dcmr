                                  DC REGULATIONS

LOCATION OF PARKING SPACES (§ 11-2116)

2116.1. Except as provided in §§ 214, 510, 708, 730, 743.2(d), 753.1(c),
   761.2, 803.1, 926, 2116.5, 2116.10 and 2117.9(c), all parking spaces shall be
   located on the same lot with the buildings or structures they are intended to
   serve.

   2116.2. Parking spaces, including car-sharing spaces, shall be located in one
   (1) of the following ways:
   
   (a)	Within a permitted garage or carport, subject to the special provisions of
   chapter 23 and § 2116. 12; or
   
   
   
   (b)	On an open area of the lot except as provided in § 2116.4.

   2116.3. For a church, up to fifty percent (50%) of the number of parking
   spaces may be located elsewhere. The spaces shall be located within four
   hundred feet (400 ft.) of the church in a public or private parking lot or
   garage where the required number of spaces are made available for the use of
   the church through a binding agreement with the owners of the parking
   facility. However, at least three (3) parking spaces shall be provided on the
   lot where the church is located.

   2116.4. Parking spaces shall not be located in the following areas:
   
   
   
   (a)	Between a building restriction line and a lot line abutting a street; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Except in an Industrial District or a building used solely as a parking
   attendant shelter, between a lot line abutting a street and the more
   restrictive of either a building façade or a line extending from and parallel
   to a building façade.

   2116.5. Except as provided in § 2117.9, if approved by the Board of Zoning
   Adjustment pursuant to § 3104 for special exceptions, open parking spaces
   accessory to any building or structure may be located anywhere on the lot upon
   which the building or structure is located, or elsewhere, except in the case
   of a one-family dwelling, in accordance with §§ 2116.6 through 2116.9.

   2116.6. The Board shall determine that it is not practical to locate the
   spaces in accordance with § 2116.2 for the following reasons:
   
   (a)	Unusual topography, grades, shape, size, or dimensions of the lot;
   
   
   
   (b)	The lack of an alley or the lack of appropriate ingress or egress through
   existing or proposed alleys or streets;
   
   
   
   (c)	Traffic hazards caused by unusual street grades; or
   
   (d)	The location of required parking spaces elsewhere on the same lot or on
   another lot would result in more efficient use of land, better design or
   landscaping, safer ingress or egress, and less adverse impact on neighboring
   properties.

   2116.7. When the accessory parking spaces are to be located elsewhere than on
   the lot upon which the building or structure they are intended to serve is
   located, the parking on adjacent lots or lots separated only by an alley from
   the lot upon which the building or structure is located, shall be preferred.

   2116.8. The accessory parking spaces shall be located so as to furnish
   reasonable and convenient parking facilities for the occupants or guests of
   the building or structures that they are designed to serve.

   2116.9. The Board may impose conditions on any accessory or non-accessory
   parking spaces as to screening, coping, setbacks, fences, the location of
   entrances and exits, or any other requirement it deems necessary to protect
   adjacent or nearby property. It may also impose other conditions it deems
   necessary to assure the continued provision and maintenance of the spaces.

   2116.10. Notwithstanding §§ 106.7 and 2116.1, parking spaces serving the
   District of Columbia Correctional Facility and other uses and agencies
   currently on the site as of March 2, 2007 may be located anywhere within
   Public Reservation 13 tract.

   2116.11. Subsection 2116.10 shall expire in seven (7) years.

   2116.12. Except for parking in an Industrial Zone or accessory to a one-family
   dwelling, parking spaces provided within a structure shall be located at least
   twenty feet (20 ft.) from all lot lines that abut public streets, unless the
   ceilings of all parking levels are at or below the grade of the adjacent
   public sidewalk at all points along the building frontage.
