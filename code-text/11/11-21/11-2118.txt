                                  DC REGULATIONS

RULES OF INTERPRETATION (§ 11-2118)

2118.1. For the purpose of this chapter, the rules of interpretation set forth
   in this section shall apply.

   2118.2. Where individual seats are not provided, each eighteen inches (18 in.)
   of benches or other similar seating shall be considered as one (1) seat.

   2118.3. The number of teachers or employees shall be computed on the basis of
   the greatest number of persons to be employed at any one period during the day
   or night, including persons having both full-time and part-time employment.

   2118.4. In computing the number of parking spaces required, that portion of
   the gross floor area or cellar area devoted to parking spaces, loading berths,
   loading platforms, service/delivery loading spaces, and vehicular access to
   parking spaces, may be excluded.

   2118.5. In the case of mixed uses, the parking spaces required shall be the
   sum of the requirements for the various individual uses computed separately in
   accordance with § 2101. Parking spaces for one use shall not be considered as
   providing the required parking spaces for any other use.

   2118.6. Whenever calculations based on the schedule set forth in § 2101
   result in a fractional space, any fraction under one-half shall be disregarded
   and any fraction of one-half or over shall require one (1) parking space.

   2118.7. No parking spaces are required for buildings or structures with a
   gross floor area and cellar floor area less than the minimum sizes specified
   in the schedule established by § 2101. However, for buildings or structures
   containing more than one (1) commercial use where the first three thousand
   square feet (3,000 ft.2) of gross floor area and cellar floor area do not
   require parking, this exemption shall apply to the combined gross floor area
   and cellar floor area contained in the building or structure and shall be
   pro-rated between the separate uses.

   2118.8. In the case of parking reductions allowed under §§ 2102 through
   2105, 2107, 2108, and 2117.9(c), no more than one (1) parking reduction shall
   be permitted. A reduction granted under one (1) section shall be considered a
   reduction for all such sections.

   2118.9. Except where otherwise indicated, whenever the word &#8220;all&#8221;
   is followed by the words &#8220;parking spaces&#8221; in the same sentence,
   the parking requirements as specified shall apply to all parking spaces,
   whether or not the spaces are required by this chapter. The requirements shall
   also apply to both accessory parking spaces and parking spaces that are
   constructed as a principal use unless otherwise specified.

   2118.10. No parking shall be provided that restricts vehicular access to and
   from gasoline pumps from any point of access to the gasoline service station.
