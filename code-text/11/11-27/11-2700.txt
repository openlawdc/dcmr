                                  DC REGULATIONS

PURPOSE (ยง 11-2700)

2700.1. The purposes of the regulation of antennas, antenna towers, and
   monopoles as a particular type of structure shall be as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	The Zoning Commission has determined that certain antennas, antenna
   towers, and monopoles because of their size, shape, design, construction, or
   location, may affect the welfare or safety of the population and may detract
   from the streetscape, landscape, skyline, scenic beauty, or aesthetic
   interests of Washington, D.C., and its role as the Nation&#8217;s Capital;
   
   
   
   (b)	The Zoning Regulations therefore regulate the size, height, construction,
   design, and location of antennas, antenna towers, and monopoles which have the
   greatest potential for adverse impact on the health, safety, and welfare of
   the population, and on neighborhood quality, and those which have the greatest
   potential for adverse impact on the scenic beauty of the Nation&#8217;s
   Capital and the national monuments; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The principal types of antennas, antenna towers, and monopoles regulated
   are those that, because of their shape, size, or quantity, potentially have
   the greatest visual impact and include, by example, large satellite earth
   station antennas, certain microwave terrestrial antennas, monopoles, and
   antenna towers.

   2700.2. Consistent with these purposes, the construction of new towers or
   monopoles shall only be permitted subject to certain placement and
   construction standards.
