                                  DC REGULATIONS

TREE AND SLOPE PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICT (TSP) (ยง 11-1511)

1511.1. The Tree and Slope Protection (TSP) Overlay District is established to
   preserve and enhance the park-like setting of designated neighborhoods
   adjacent to streams or parks by regulating alteration or disturbance of
   terrain, destruction of trees, and ground coverage of permitted buildings and
   other impervious surfaces.

   1511.2. The TSP Overlay District shall include a number of individual overlay
   zone districts that may be established and mapped from time to time,
   consistent with the general provisions of this chapter.

   1511.3. The purposes of the TSP Overlay District is to:
   
   
   
   (a)	Preserve the natural topography and mature trees to the maximum extent
   feasible in a residential neighborhood;
   
   
   
   (b)	Prevent significant adverse impact on adjacent open space, parkland,
   stream beds, or other environmentally sensitive natural areas; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Limit permitted ground coverage of new and expanded buildings and other
   construction, so as to encourage a general compatibility between the siting of
   new buildings and the existing neighborhood.

   1511.4. The TSP Overlay District is designed for residential neighborhoods
   that are located at the edge of stream beds or public open spaces and that
   have a significant quantity of steep slopes, stands of mature trees, and
   undeveloped lots and parcels subject to potential terrain alteration and tree
   removal. It is not suitable for mapping in neighborhoods where nearly all lots
   are already developed on a rectangular grid system and the existing mature
   trees are either yard trees or street trees.
