WESLEY HEIGHTS OVERLAY DISTRICT (WH) (ยง 11-1541)

1541.1. The Wesley Heights (WH) Overlay District is established to preserve
   and enhance the low density character of Wesley Heights by regulating
   construction and alteration of residential and other buildings in the area.

   1541.2. The WH Overlay District shall apply to the area and properties
   contained in this subsection:
   
   
   
   (a)	The area is generally bounded by a line which begins at the intersection
   of Nebraska and New Mexico Avenues and runs southeast along the center line of
   New Mexico Avenue, N.W., to the western boundary of Glover Archbold Park. The
   line then runs south and west along the west boundary of Glover Archbold Park
   to a point east of the southernmost point of Lot 33 of Square 1341. The line
   then runs west across 44th Street to the southwest boundary of Lot 33. The
   line then runs in a northerly direction along the rear lot lines of the
   properties on the west side of 44th Street, to the southern boundary of Lot 15
   of Square 1341, inclusive of Lot 33. (For those lots with narrow frontages on
   the west side of 44th Street, the WH Overlay District boundary line shall
   cross those narrow lot frontages by connecting the rear lot lines of the
   adjacent lots across the narrow lot frontage.) The line then runs west along
   the southern boundary of Lot 15; then runs northwest along the west boundary
   of Lot 15; then runs in a westerly direction along the right-of-way of the
   Dexter Court cul-de-sac excluding Lots 19-21, and then runs southwest along
   the south boundary of Lot 18. The line then runs north along the west boundary
   of Lot 18 to the southern boundary of Lot 805. The line then runs west along
   the southern boundaries of Lots 805 and 800; then runs north along the west
   boundary of Lot 800; then runs west to Foxhall Road along the southern
   boundary of Lot 804. The line then runs south along the center line of Foxhall
   Road; then runs west along the northern boundary of Lot 813 of Square 1380;
   then runs southwest along the rear of Lots 4, 5, and 820 of Square 1380; then
   runs west to 49th Street along the southern boundaries of Lots 820 to 824,
   826, and 6 of Square 1380. The line then runs north along the western boundary
   of 49th Street right-of-way; continues east along the northern boundary of
   Cathedral Avenue right-of-way; and turns north along the property line at the
   rear of the properties on the west side of Foxhall Road (including all of
   Square 1523 and Lots 28 and 29 of Square 1521). The line then runs east along
   the northern property line of Lot 28 of Square 1521 to Foxhall Road, then runs
   north along the west boundary of the Foxhall Road right-of-way to New Mexico
   Avenue. The line then runs northeast along the center line of New Mexico
   Avenue to the point of origin at the intersection of New Mexico and Nebraska
   Avenues, N.W.; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The properties that are contained within the boundaries of the WH Overlay

   824, and 826 in Square 1397; and Lots 804 and 805 in Square 1601).

   1541.3. The purposes of the WH Overlay District are to:
   
   
   
   (a)	Preserve in general the current density of neighborhood;
   
   
   
   (b)	Allow reasonable opportunities for owners to expand their dwellings; and
