CAPITOL HILL COMMERCIAL OVERLAY DISTRICT (CHC) (ยง 11-1570)

1570.1. The Capitol Hill Commercial (CHC) Overlay District is established to
   implement the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan, particularly those
   land use objectives and policies relating to improving the physical condition
   of Capitol Hill through the provision of functional, efficient, and attractive
   commercial areas; minimizing conflicts between various land uses; locating
   more intensive and active land uses in areas of Capitol Hill that can
   accommodate and support such uses; stabilizing and improving commercial areas
   in portions of Capitol Hill; ensuring the integrity of the Capitol Hill
   Historic District; and developing and establishing special land use categories
   to meet the unique characteristics of the commercial areas of Capitol Hill.

   permitted in the underlying zone districts;
   
   
   
   (c)	Concentrate nonresidential uses in Commercial Zone Districts in certain
   areas of Capitol Hill, thereby enhancing and protecting the residential

   pressure to use properties zoned residential for commercial uses; and
