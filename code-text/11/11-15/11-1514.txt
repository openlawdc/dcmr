   limitations:
   
   
   
   (a)	The restrictions of this section against removing, cutting down, or
   fatally damaging trees apply only to trees having a circumference of twelve
   inches (12 in.) or greater at a height of four and one-half feet (41/2 ft.)
   above ground;
   
   
   
   (b)	The prohibitions of this section do not apply to the removal of any dead
   or unhealthy tree or a tree that creates an unsafe condition. The need for
   removal of any tree shall be certified by an arborist or other tree care
   professional;
   
   
   
   (c)	No tree that has a circumference of seventy-five inches (75 in.) or more
   at a height of four and one-half feet (41/2 ft.) above ground may be removed
   or cut down;
   
   
   
   (d)	No more than three (3) trees that each have a circumference of more than
   thirty-eight inches (38 in.) at a height of four and one-half feet (41/2 ft.)
   above ground may be removed, and none of these may be located within
   twenty-five feet (25 ft.) of any building restriction line or lot line
   abutting a public street;
   
   
   
   (e)	The total circumference inches of all trees removed or cut down on a lot
   shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the total circumference inches
   of all trees on the lot having a circumference of twelve inches (12 in.) or
   greater at a height of four and one-half feet (4 1/2 ft.) above ground;
   provided that this restriction does not abrogate the right to remove up to
   three (3) trees as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection; and
   
   
   
   (f)	Where removal or cutting or trees has occurred that would have been
   prohibited by this section if an application for a building permit had been
   contemporaneously filed, no building permit shall be issued for a period of
   seven (7) years from such removal or cutting unless the Board of Zoning
   Adjustment grants a special exception pursuant to ยง 1515.
