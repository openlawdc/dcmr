                                  DC REGULATIONS

SIXTEENTH STREET HEIGHTS OVERLAY DISTRICT (SSH) (ยง 11-1551)

1551.1. The Sixteenth Street Heights (SSH) Overlay District is established to
   help accomplish several goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan,
   especially those land use objectives relating to housing supply, neighborhood
   quality and character, and policies relating to human services and private
   institutions, as applied to the 16th Street Heights neighborhood.

   1551.2. The purposes of the SSH Overlay District are to:
   
   
   
   (a)	Promote the conservation, enhancement, and stability of this low-density,
   single-family neighborhood for housing and neighborhood-related uses;
   
   
   
   (b)	Control the expansion of nonresidential uses, and/or further conversion of
   residential housing to nonresidential uses in order to maintain the housing
   supply and minimize the external negative impacts of new nonresidential uses
   that are permitted in the SSH/R-1-B District in order to preserve neighborhood
   quality; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Allow neighborhoods to continue to provide a range of health and social
   service facilities as well as private institutions that provide cultural and
   religious enrichment and economic vitality, but within the framework of
   improved public review and control over the external effects of nonresidential
   uses. The objective is to make more compatible the Comprehensive Plan&#8217;s
   goals and policies for maintaining the quality and stability of residential
   neighborhoods with other policies related to the reasonable provision of human
   services throughout the District of Columbia.

   1551.3. The Sixteenth Street Heights (SSH) Overlay District is comprised of
   the SSH-1 and the SSH-2 Districts.

   1551.4. The SSH-1 Overlay District encompasses the geographic area in
   northwest Washington generally bounded by 16th Street and Rock Creek Park on
   the west, Military Road and Missouri Avenue on the north, and 14th Street on
   the east, and Colorado Avenue on the southeast.  This overlay zone is applied
   to properties zoned R-1-B in the following squares and portions of squares: 
   2718, 2719, 2720, 2720W, 2721, 2721W, 2722, 2722W, 2723, 2723W, 2724, 2724W,
   2725, 2741, 2742, 2796, and 2799.

   1551.5. The provisions of the SSH-1 Overlay District shall be applied
   properties identified in ยง 1551.4 based on the following key findings:
   
   
   
   (a)	Over a period of years, approximately one in every ten (10) houses in the
   SSH-1 District has been converted to a nonresidential use, a much higher ratio
   than has been identified for any other R-1-zoned neighborhood in the District
   of Columbia; the neighborhood accommodates a significant number and range of
   human service facilities and private institutions to an extent that new and
   significantly expanded nonresidential use facilities should be governed by
   improved public review to ameliorate adverse impacts on immediate and nearby
   neighbors and preserve a predominantly single-family residential character;
   
   
   
   (b)	The SSH-1 neighborhood boundaries are well established and encompass a
   significant geographic area; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The District of Columbia executive branch and councilmembers have
   identified the number of nonresidential uses and the conversion of houses to
   these uses in this neighborhood as a serious planning and enforcement problem
   for more than ten (10) years, as reflected in the legislative history of
   adopted provisions in the Comprehensive Plan in effect on July 29, 1994.

   1551.6. The SSH-2 Overlay District encompasses the geographic area in
   northwest Washington generally bounded by 16th Street on the west, Colorado
   Avenue on the north, 14th Street on the east, and Decatur Street to the south.
    This overlay zone is applied to properties zoned R-1-B in the following
   squares and portions of squares:  2708, 2709, 2710, 2711, 2712, 2713, 2714,
   2715, and 2716.
   
   
   
   1551.7 	The provisions of the SSH-2 Overlay District shall be applied to the
   properties described in  1551.6 based on the following key findings:
   
   
   
   More than 20% of the residentially zoned land is used for nonresidential
   purposes;
   
   
   
   The neighborhood boundaries are well established and encompass a significant
   geographic area; and
   
   
   
   The District of Columbia Comprehensive Plan has identified the number of
   nonresidential uses in the neighborhood as a problem.
