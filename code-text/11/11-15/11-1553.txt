   to ten percent (10%) of its gross floor area as a matter of right under the
   provisions of the R-1-B District; provided, that the following requirements

   following requirements:
   
   
   
   (a)	The nonresidential use is capable of being established and operated

   and
   
   
   
   (b)	There shall be adequate, appropriately located, and screened off-street
   parking sufficient to provide for the needs of the maximum number of
   occupants, employees, congregants, and visitors who can use the facility at
   one time; provided:
   
   
   
   (1)	The number of parking spaces provided shall be not less than the number
   required by chapter 21 of this title and shall be located and designed so that
   they have the least objectionable effects on contiguous or nearby property
   because of noise, traffic, or other objectionable conditions;
   
   
   
   (2)	Parking spaces and driveways providing access to them shall not be located
   in a required side yard, or on the lot between the principal building and a
   street right-of-way, nor in public space abutting the lot;
   
   
   
   (3)	If five (5) or more open parking spaces are provided, the parking spaces
   shall be screened from all contiguous residential property by a wood fence or
   a wall made of brick or stone at least twelve inches (12 in.) thick and
   forty-two inches (42 in.) high, or by evergreen hedges or evergreen growing
   trees that are thickly planted and maintained and are at least forty-two
   inches (42 in.) in height when planted; and
   
   
   
   (4)	Any lighting used to illuminate open parking spaces shall be so arranged
   that all direct rays of lighting are confined to the surface of the paved area
   devoted to parking; any lighting provided shall be the minimum necessary for
   reasonable visibility by drivers and for security purposes.

   1553.3. Any expansion, renewal of time limits, or other changes to an existing
   use permitted by special exception in the R-1 District provisions shall
   continue to be governed by the R-1 provisions rather than those of this
   overlay district.
