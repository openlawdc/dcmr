PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (DC) (ยง 11-1503)

1503.1. In the DC Overlay District, the matter-of-right height and floor area
   ratio limits shall serve as the maximum permitted height and floor area ratio
   for a planned unit development.

   1503.2. In the DC Overlay District, the minimum area included within the
   proposed development shall be one (1) acre in any Residence, Special Purpose,
   and Mixed Use District, and one-half (1/2) acre in any other zone district. No
   waiver shall exceed five percent (5%) of the minimum area requirements. If a
   waiver of the minimum area is granted, the Zoning Commission must find, after
   public hearing, that the development is of exceptional merit and is in the
   best interests of the District of Columbia or the country.

   1503.3. In the DC Overlay District, all land within the planned unit
   development must be contiguous and must neither be separated by a street or
   alley nor bridge a street or alley.
