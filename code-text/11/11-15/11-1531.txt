NAVAL OBSERVATORY PRECINCT OVERLAY DISTRICT (NO) (ยง 11-1531)

1531.1. The Naval Observatory Precinct (NO) Overlay District is established to
   promote the public health, safety, and general welfare on land adjacent to or
   in close proximity to the highly sensitive and historically important Naval
   Observatory, in keeping with the goals and policies of the Federal and
   District elements of the Comprehensive Plan and the adopted Master Plan for
   that facility.

   1531.2. Public land within the NO Overlay District shall be used in a manner
   consistent with the historic or ceremonial importance and special missions of
   the Naval Observatory.

   1531.3. The land use controls embodied in this title for land adjacent to the
   Naval Observatory reflect the importance of the Naval Observatory to the
   District of Columbia and the Nation.

   1531.4. The NO Overlay District is intended to provide additional controls on
   private land, in order to protect recognized Federal interest concerns. The
   concerns include the critical scientific mission performed at the Naval
   Observatory and the security needs of the Vice-President&#8217;s residence.

   1531.5. The NO Overlay District shall act to further restrict the development
   controls permitted in existing districts to reduce or eliminate any possible
   harm or restrictions on the mission of the Federal establishment within the NO
   Overlay District.

   1531.6. The NO Overlay District shall be mapped in combination with any
   underlying zone district and not instead of the underlying zoning.

   1531.7. All uses, buildings, and structures permitted in accordance with the
   appropriate sections of this chapter for the respective districts with which
   the mapped NO Overlay District is combined shall be permitted in those
   districts, except as specifically modified by this chapter.

   1531.8. All restrictions or prohibitions applicable to either of the districts
   combined pursuant to this chapter shall apply in the NO Overlay District.
