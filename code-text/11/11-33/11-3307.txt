                                  DC REGULATIONS

COMBINED LOTS (ยง 11-3307)

In any StE subdistrict with a minimum residential requirement, two (2) or more
lots within such a subdistrict may be combined for the purpose of achieving the
required FAR equivalent of residential uses, subject to the following:





The total height and density limits of the subdistrict(s) shall not be exceeded;
and





The combined lot provisions may not be used to transfer density to or from any
property within the StE-2, StE-10, StE-14a, StE-14b, StE-18, or StE-19
subdistricts.





No allocation of gross floor area shall be effective unless an instrument,
legally sufficient to effect such a transfer, is filed with the Zoning
Administrator and recorded by the Recorder of Deeds in the land records against
all lots included in the combined lot development.





The instrument shall be in the form of a declaration of covenants that:





Is signed by the owners of all affected parcels;





Runs with the land in perpetuity;





Burdens all parcels involved in the allocation of gross floor area; and





States the maximum permitted gross floor areas for all uses in all parcels, the
maximum allowed gross floor area for nonresidential uses in all parcels and the
gross floor area of nonresidential uses allocated. The covenant shall further
state that, after the transfer, the combined lots conform to the maximum gross
floor area limitations.





The declaration of covenants shall expressly state that it may be substantively
amended or terminated only with the approval of the Zoning Administrator.





The declaration of covenants shall be approved in content by the Zoning
Administrator and certified for legal sufficiency by the Office of the Attorney
General. The declaration shall also contain a written statement by the Director
of the D.C. Office of Planning attesting to:





The lots&#8217; eligibility to allocate residential and nonresidential uses;





The accuracy of the computations with respect to the amount of residential and
nonresidential uses allocated; and





Whether, after the transfer, the combined lots will conform to the maximum gross
floor area limitations for the lots before any such transfer.
