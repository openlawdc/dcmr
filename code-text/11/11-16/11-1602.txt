                                  DC REGULATIONS

COMBINED LOT DEVELOPMENT (CG) (§ 11-1602)

1602.1. Two (2) or more lots within the Overlay District may be combined for
   the purpose of allocating residential and nonresidential uses regardless of
   the normal limitation on floor area by uses on each lot; provided, that the
   aggregate residential and nonresidential floor area shall not exceed the
   matter-of-right maximum height or density of the underlying zone district(s),
   except when bonus density is being constructed, subject to the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Within the CG/CR District, the residential and nonresidential floor area
   on each individual parcel shall not exceed a maximum floor area ratio of 8.0
   on parcels for which a height of 110 feet is permitted or 8.5 on parcels for
   which a height of 130 feet is permitted by the Act to Regulate the Height of
   Buildings in the District of Columbia, approved June 1, 1910 (36 Stat. 452;
   D.C. Official Code §§ 6-601.01 to 6-601.09) as amended (the &#8220;Height
   Act&#8221;), including any bonus density;
   
   
   
   (b)	Within the CG/CR District, the amount of commercial density transferred
   from one parcel to another may not exceed the lesser of a density of 3.0 FAR
   or the amount of residential density being transferred;
   
   
   
   (c)	Maximum permitted height shall be that permitted for any site receiving
   combined lot density within the CG/CR District, but only to the extent
   necessary to accommodate any additional density received from another parcel;
   
   
   
   (d)	The combined lot provisions may not be used to transfer density to or from
   any property within the CG/R-5-E, CG/C-2-C, CG/C-3-C, CG/W-1, CG/W-2, or
   CG/W-3 Districts; and
   
   
   
   (e)	In addition to the amount of density that may be transferred in accordance
   with § 1602.1(a), the Zoning Commission may, at its discretion, grant an
   additional transfer of density of 1.0 FAR maximum to or within Squares 700,
   701, and 702, subject to the applicant addressing to the satisfaction of the
   Zoning Commission the objectives and guidelines of §§ 1601 and 1604-1607, as
   applicable.

   1602.2. No allocation of gross floor area shall be effective unless an
   instrument, legally sufficient to effect such a transfer, is filed with the
   Zoning Administrator and recorded by the Recorder of Deeds in the land records
   against all lots included in the combined lot development.

   1602.3. The instrument shall be in the form of a declaration of covenants
   that:
   
   
   
   (a)	Is signed by the owners of all affected lots;
   
   
   
   (b)	Runs with the land in perpetuity;
   
   
   
   (c)	Burdens all lots involved in the allocation of gross floor area;
   
   
   
   (d)	Binds the present and future owners of the lot sending nonresidential
   gross floor area to forgo the nonresidential development and occupation of an
   on-site area equal to the amount of gross floor area of nonresidential uses
   transferred; and
   
   
   
   (e)	States the maximum permitted gross floor areas for all uses in all lots,
   the maximum allowed gross floor area for nonresidential uses in all lots, and
   the gross floor area of nonresidential uses allocated. The covenant shall
   further state that, after the transfer, the combined lots conform with the
   maximum gross floor area limitations for nonresidential uses on the lots
   before the transfer.

   1602.4. The declaration of covenants shall expressly state that it may be
   substantively amended or terminated only with the approval of the Zoning
   Commission, after public hearing, and only upon a finding that the proposed
   amendment or termination is fully justified and consistent with the purposes
   of this chapter.

   1602.5. The declaration of covenants shall be approved in content by the
   Zoning Administrator and certified for legal sufficiency by the Office of the
   Attorney General. The declaration shall also contain a written statement by
   the Director of the D.C. Office of Planning attesting to:
   
   
   
   (a)	The lots&#8217; eligibility to allocate residential and nonresidential
   uses;
   
   
   
   (b)	The accuracy of the computations with respect to the amount of residential
   and nonresidential uses allocated; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Whether, after the transfer, the combined lots will conform with the
   maximum gross floor area limitations on nonresidential uses for the lots
   before any such transfer.
