   (including, but not limited to office and transportation facilities) that has
   as its primary purpose the hosting of professional athletic team events.

   1612.3. The Ballpark may also be used to host events customarily held in such

   6-601.09), as amended. For the purposes of determining height for a Ballpark,
   height shall mean the vertical distance measured from the level of the curb

   one-to-one (1:1) step back from the building line along South Capitol Street.

   1612.7. All parking spaces within the Ballpark Site shall be provided
   underground. At or above grade parking spaces shall be permitted if approved

   of § 1612.10. Of this number, a minimum of 125 shall be designated
   handicapped parking spaces. Any parking spaces in addition to the 1,225 amount

   (b)	Compliance with the provisions of §§ 1612.19 and 1612.20.

   1612.9. In considering whether to approve additional ballpark-related at or
   above-ground parking spaces under §1612.8, the Zoning Commission shall judge,

   doors and entranceways designed to complement the building facade, and shall
