   §§ 701.1 through 701.5 and §§ 721.1 through 721.6 of this Title; provided,
   that the following uses shall not be permitted: automobile, laundry,
   drive-through accessory to any use, gasoline service stations, and office uses

   1607.4. Preferred uses shall occupy 100% of the building&#8217;s street
   frontage along Half Street S.E., except for space devoted to building
   entrances or required to be devoted to fire control.

   1607.5. The minimum floor-to-ceiling clear height for portions of the ground
   floor level devoted to preferred uses shall be fourteen (14) feet.

   occupancy of the preferred use space required by § 1607.2 by non-preferred
   uses for up to a five (5) year period; provided, that the ground floor space
   is suitably designed for future occupancy by the preferred uses.

   1607.7. No private driveway may be constructed or used from Half Street S.E.
