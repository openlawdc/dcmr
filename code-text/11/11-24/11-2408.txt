                                  DC REGULATIONS

PROCESSING OF SECOND-STAGE PUD APPLICATIONS (§ 11-2408)

2408.1. In accordance with §§ 2406.12 and 2407.8 through 2407.11, the
   applicant may file an application for second-stage PUD approval.

   2408.2. The application shall be filed on a form as may be designated from
   time-to-time by the Commission.

   2408.3. The Commission shall review the application. If the Commission
   determines that the application complies with all of the requirements of the
   first-stage approval, it shall schedule a public hearing on the second-stage
   application. It is the intention of the Commission that any second-stage
   application that is substantially in accordance with the elements, guidelines,
   and conditions of the first-stage approval shall be granted a hearing.

   2408.4. The Commission shall submit the application to the D.C. Office of
   Planning for coordination, review, report, and impact assessment of the final
   design. The assessment shall include reports in writing from all relevant
   District agencies and departments, including, but not limited to, the
   Departments of Transportation and Housing and Community Development and, if a
   historic district or district landmark is involved, the State Historic
   Preservation Officer.

   2408.5. Notice for the public hearing shall be given in the same manner as for
   amendments to the Zoning Map as contained in chapter 30 of this title. The
   hearing shall be conducted as a contested case in accordance with those rules.
   
   
   
   2408.6 	If the Commission finds the application to be in accordance with the
   intent and purpose of the Zoning Regulations, the PUD process, and the
   first-stage approval, the Commission shall grant approval to the second-stage
   application, including any guidelines, conditions, and standards that are
   necessary to carry out the Commission&#8217;s decision.  No order approving a
   PUD shall be deemed to include relief from any zoning regulation, including
   but not limited to the requirements of Chapter 26, unless such relief was
   expressly requested by the applicant and expressly granted in the order.

   2408.7. In granting second-stage approval, the Commission may specify that the
   project be built in stages and shall specify the timing of the stages.

   2408.8. The final PUD approved by the Commission shall be valid for a period
   of two (2) years, within which time application shall be filed for a building
   permit, as specified in § 2409.1

   2408.9. Construction shall start within three (3) years of the date of final
   approval.

   2408.10. The Commission may extend the time periods set forth in §§ 2408.8
   and 2408.9 for good cause shown upon the filing of a written request by the
   applicant before the expiration of the approval; provided, that the Commission
   determines that the following requirements are met:
   
   
   
   (a)	The extension request is served on all parties to the application by the
   applicant, and all parties are allowed thirty (30) days to respond;
   
   
   
   (b)	There is no substantial change in any of the material facts upon which the
   Commission based its original approval of the PUD that would undermine the
   Commission&#8217;s justification for approving the original PUD; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The applicant demonstrates with substantial evidence that there is good
   cause for such extension, as provided in § 2408.11.

   2408.11. For purposes of § 2408.10(c), an extension of the validity of a PUD
   may be granted by the Commission for good cause shown if an applicant has
   demonstrated with substantial evidence one or more of the following criteria:
   
   
   
   (a)	An inability to obtain sufficient project financing for the PUD, following
   an applicant&#8217; s diligent good faith efforts to obtain such financing,
   because of changes in economic and market conditions beyond the
   applicant&#8217; s reasonable control;
   
   
   
   (b)	An inability to secure all required governmental agency approvals for a
   PUD by the expiration date of the PUD order because of delays in the
   governmental agency approval process that are beyond the applicant&#8217; s
   reasonable control; or
   
   
   
   (c)	The existence of pending litigation or such other condition, circumstance,
   or factor beyond the applicant’ s reasonable control that renders the
   applicant unable to comply with the time limits of the PUD order.

   2408.12. The Commission shall hold a public hearing on a request for an
   extension of the validity of a PUD only if, in the determination of the
   Commission, there is a material factual conflict that has been generated by
   the parties to the PUD proceedings concerning any of the criteria in §
   2408.11. The hearing shall be limited to the specific and relevant evidentiary
   issues in dispute.

   2408.13. In the event an appeal is filed in a court of competent jurisdiction
   from an order of the Commission, the time limitations of §§ 2408.8 and
   2408.9 shall run from the decision date of the court’ s final determination
   of the appeal. Unless stayed by the Commission or a court of competent
   jurisdiction, an applicant may proceed pursuant to the order of the Commission
   prior to any such final determination.

   2408.14. If no application for a permit is filed, construction has not started
   within the period specified, or no extension is granted, the approval shall
   expire, the zoning shall revert to the pre-existing regulations and map, and
   the approval shall not be reinstated unless a new application is filed,
   processes, and approved in accordance with this chapter.

   2408.15. A change of zoning approved in conjunction with a PUD shall not
   become effective until the covenant required in § 2409.3 has been recorded.

   2408.16. The grant of a PUD prohibits any construction on the PUD site that is
   not authorized in the order approving the PUD, including development under
   matter of right standards, until:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The validity of the PUD order expires; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The Commission issues an order granting the applicant’s motion to extinguish
   the PUD.
