                                  DC REGULATIONS

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) (§ 11-2400)

2400.1. The planned unit development (PUD) process is designed to encourage
   high quality developments that provide public benefits.

   2400.2. The overall goal is to permit flexibility of development and other
   incentives, such as increased building height and density; provided, that the
   project offers a commendable number or quality of public benefits and that it
   protects and advances the public health, safety, welfare, and convenience.

   2400.3. A comprehensive public review by the Zoning Commission of the specific
   development proposal is required in order to evaluate the public benefits
   offered in proportion to the flexibility or incentives requested and in order
   to establish a basis for long-term public control over the specific use and
   development of the property.

   2400.4. While providing for greater flexibility in planning and design than
   may be possible under conventional zoning procedures, the PUD process shall
   not be used to circumvent the intent and purposes of the Zoning Regulations,
   nor to result in action that is inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan.

   2400.5. The Commission may approve a PUD application with or without
   modifications. In carrying out the purposes of this chapter, the Commission
   may establish general standards and, in individual cases, set standards and
   conditions for height and bulk lesser or greater than the standards
   established for the affected districts in this chapter or elsewhere in this
   title.

   2400.6. The Commission may also set appropriate time limits for benefits
   conferred under this chapter to individual applicants in order to ensure the
   construction of a proposed development in accordance with the conditions
   established.

   2400.7. Failure of an applicant to complete a proposed development as directed
   within the time limits set by the Commission or the Zoning Regulations shall
   result in the termination of the benefits granted under the application, and
   reversion of the zoning controls to the pre-existing regulations and map.

   2400.8. An Electronic Equipment Facility (EEF) may occupy more than fifty
   percent (50%) of the gross floor area of a building in the C-3 and C-4
   Districts, if approved as part of a PUD in accordance with the requirements of
   this chapter and subject to the following additional criteria:
   
   
   
   (a)	The aggregate total area to be devoted to EEF use may not exceed fifty
   percent (50%) of the permitted gross floor area of the entire project; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The EEF shall be located on a portion of the lot that does not directly
   front on a street so as to preclude retail, service, and office uses from
   being developed on the street frontage of the project.
   
   
   
   	AUTHORITY: Unless otherwise noted, the authority for this chapter is the
   Zoning Act of 1938, approved June 20, 1938 (52 Stat. 797, as, amended; D.C.
