   2405.7. Notwithstanding the other prerogatives of the Commission in approving
   uses in PUDs, the Commission shall reserve the option to approve any use that
   is permitted as a special exception and that would otherwise require the

   2405.8. Approval of the Board shall not be required for any such use approved
   by the Commission under § 2405.7, and the Commission shall not be required to
