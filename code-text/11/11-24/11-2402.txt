                                  DC REGULATIONS

TYPES OF APPLICATIONS (§ 11-2402)

2402.1. The PUD process may be either a one-stage or a two-stage process.

   2402.2. The two (2) parts of a two-stage PUD shall be as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	The first stage involves a general review of the site&#8217;s suitability
   for use as a PUD; the appropriateness, character, scale, mixture of uses, and
   design of the uses proposed; and the compatibility of the proposed development
   with city-wide, ward, and area plans of the District of Columbia, and the
   other goals of the PUD process; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The second stage is a detailed site plan review to determine compliance
   with the intent and purposes of the PUD process, the first stage approval, and
   this title.

   2402.3. An applicant may elect to file a single application for consolidated
   PUD review, consolidating the two-stage review into one proceeding.

   2402.4. To initiate a consolidated review, an applicant shall file all of the
   material required for both the first and second stages, as specified in §§
   2406.11 and 2406.12, at the time of initial filing. The applicant shall also
   comply with the requirements of §§ 2406.7 through 2406.10 regarding
   pre-filing notices.

   2402.5. The application shall be processed as if it were a preliminary
   application. When the Commission considers whether to set the case for a
   hearing, the Commission shall determine whether the application is
   sufficiently clear and detailed to be considered at one proceeding.

   2402.6. The Commission reserves the right to direct an applicant to revise a
   one-stage application into a two-stage application, if in the opinion of the
   Commission the circumstances and issues surrounding the proposal require a
   two-stage review.

   2402.7. The Commission may dismiss or deny the application at the conclusion
   of the presentation of the applicant’s case or at any point thereafter.
