PROCESSING OF FIRST-STAGE PUD APPLICATIONS (§ 11-2407)

2407.1. The Commission shall refer a PUD application to the D.C. Office of
   Planning, which shall report to the Commission on whether the application is
   consistent with the purpose of the PUD process, and whether or not a hearing
   should be held.

   2407.2. Following the receipt of the report from the Office of Planning, the
   Commission shall review the application and determine whether a public hearing
   shall be granted. An application may be denied without a hearing, but no
   application shall be granted unless a public hearing is held.

   2407.3. If a public hearing is granted, the Office of Planning shall
   coordinate review of the application and prepare an impact assessment of the
   project, which shall include reports in writing from relevant District
   departments and agencies, including, but not limited to, the Departments of
   Transportation and Housing and Community Development and, if a historic
   district or historic landmark is involved, the State Historic Preservation
   Officer.

   2407.4. The Office of Planning shall report on the:
   
   
   
   (a)	Suitability of the site for use as a PUD;
   
   
   
   (b)	Appropriateness, character, scale, mixture of uses, and design of the uses
   proposed for the proposed development, and other identifiable public benefits;
   and
   
   
   
   (c)	Compatibility of the proposed development with the Comprehensive Plan, the
   goals of the PUD process in § 2400, and the PUD evaluation standards in §
   2403.

   2407.5. Notice for the public hearing on a PUD application shall be given in
   the same manner as for amendments to the Zoning Map as contained in chapter 30
   of this title. The hearing shall be conducted as a contested case in
   accordance with those rules.

   2407.6. At the public hearing, the applicant shall carry the burden of
   justifying the proposal Failure of groups or persons to appear in opposition
   shall not relieve the applicant of the responsibility of demonstrating the
   merits of the application.

   2407.7. At the public hearing, the applicant shall advise the Commission of
   the efforts that have been made to apprise the affected Advisory Neighborhood
   Commission and other individuals and community groups concerning the proposed
   development.

   2407.8. The Commission shall either approve, deny, or modify the application.

   2407.9. The Commission&#8217;s first-stage approval shall set forth the
   appropriate zoning classification to apply to the project, and shall state in
   detail the elements, guidelines, and conditions that shall be followed by the
   applicant in the second-stage application.

   2407.10. The first-stage approval shall be valid for a period of one year,
   unless a longer period is specified by the Commission, or unless the
   Commission extends that period.

   2407.11. The rights granted under such an approval are conditional, and shall
   be exercised within the specified time limit. Unexercised rights shall lapse
   at the end of the specified time periods, and the zoning shall revert to
   pre-existing conditions, unless a request to extend the validity of the
   approval is granted by the Commission in accordance with the standard and
   process for second-stage PUD extensions set forth in §§ 2408.10 through
   2408.12.

   2407.12. In the case of an application processed under a consolidated review,
   the Commission shall render a final decision on the application after the
   hearing process. The following shall also apply:
   
   
   
   (a)	The applicant may file directly for a building permit without filing a
   subsequent application with the Commission;
   
   
   
   (b)	The requirements for the filing of that permit application shall be the
   same as those following approval of the second-stage of the two-stage process;
   and
   
   
   
   (c)	At the point at which a decision is made on a consolidated review
   application, the Commission may also determine that a second review is
   required, and rather than approving the application in a consolidated review,
   grant first-stage approval only and require that the applicant file additional
   plans for second-stage approval.
