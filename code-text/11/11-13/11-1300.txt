PREAMBLE (NC) (§ 11-1300)

1300.1. The Neighborhood Commercial (NC) Overlay District is established to
   preserve and enhance neighborhood shopping areas, by providing the scale of

   and services.

   1300.2. The NC Overlay District includes a number of individual overlay zone
   districts that may be established and mapped from time to time, consistent

   1300.3. The purposes of the NC Overlay District are to:
   
   
   
   (a)	Encourage a scale of development, a mixture of building uses, and other
   attributes, such as safe and efficient conditions for pedestrian and vehicular
   movement, all of which will be as generally required by the Comprehensive
   Plan;
   
   
   
   (b)	Encourage retention and establishment of a variety of retail,
   entertainment, and personal service establishments, predominantly in a
   continuous pattern at ground level, so as to meet the needs of the surrounding
   area&#8217;s residents, workers, and visitors; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Limit the maximum permitted height of new buildings so as to encourage a
   general compatibility in scale between new and older buildings.

   Districts shall reflect the character, scale, and needs of the particular
   district.
