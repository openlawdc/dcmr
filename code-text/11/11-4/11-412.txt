                                  DC REGULATIONS

PERVIOUS SURFACE (§ 11-412)

412.1. The minimum pervious surface percentage requirement stated below shall
   be applicable only in conjunction with the following:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The construction of a new principal structure;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   An addition to a principal or accessory structure, other than a historic
   resource, that increases the existing lot occupancy at the time of building
   permit application by ten percent (10%) or more;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The construction of a new accessory structure that increases the existing lot
   occupancy at the time of building permit application by ten percent (10%) or
   more; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   An addition to a historic resource that increases the existing lot occupancy
   at the time of building permit application by twenty-five percent (25%) or
   more.
   
   
   
   412.2 	For the purposes of § 412.1 a historic resource is a building or
   structure listed in the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites or a
   building or structure certified in writing by the State Historic Preservation
   Officer as contributing to the character of the historic district in which it
   is located.

   412.3. Except as provided in §§ 412.1 and 412.4 or as otherwise required by
   this title, the minimum percentage of pervious surface of a lot in a Residence
   District listed in the table below shall be as set forth in the following
   table:
   
   
   
   ZONE DISTRICT AND STRUCTURE
   
   MINIMUM PERCENTAGE OF PERVIOUS SURFACE
   
   
   
   R-1 through R-4
   
   Public recreation and community centers
   
   30%
   
   
   
   R-l-A, R-l-B
   
   All other structures
   
   50%
   
   
   
   R-2
   
   All other structures
   
   30%
   
   
   
   R-3
   
   All other structures
   
   20%
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   412.4 	Except as required in § 412.3 for public recreation and community
   centers or as otherwise required by this title, in the R-4 zone a minimum
   pervious surface requirement for structures other than those listed in §
   412.2 shall be based on lot size as set forth in the following table:
   
   MINIMUM LOT SIZE
   
   MINIMUM PERCENTAGE OF PERVIOUS SURFACE
   
   
   
   Less than 1,800 square feet
   
   0%
   
   
   
   1,801 to 2,000 square feet
   
   10%
   
   
   
   Larger than 2000 square feet
   
   20%

   412.5. The percent of pervious surface area shall be calculated by dividing
   the total area of pervious surfaces on the lot by the total area of the lot.

   412.6. Only the following shall be considered pervious surfaces for the
   purposes of calculating the pervious surface area:
   
   
   
   (a)	Grass, mulched groundcover, all areas of a vegetated roof planted with a
   growing medium, and other planted areas;
   
   
   
   (b)	Permeable pavers or paving that facilitate the infiltration of water into
   the soil; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Decks or porches constructed above the surface of the lot that are erected
   on pier foundations, and that maintain a permeable surface underneath that can
   facilitate the infiltration of water into the soil.
   
   
   
   412.7 	The Board of Zoning Adjustment may grant, by special exception, a full
   or partial reduction in the minimum pervious surface requirement required by
   this section if, in addition to meeting the general requirements of § 3104,
   the applicant demonstrates that complying with the minimum pervious surface
   requirement is impractical because of size of lot, or other conditions
   relating to the lot or surrounding area that would tend to make full
   compliance unduly restrictive, prohibitively costly, or unreasonable, or as a
   result of equivalent measures being implemented on the property that provide
   the same minimum pervious surface amount.
