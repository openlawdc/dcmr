1905.1. Two (2) or more lots may be combined for the purposes of transferring
   bonus density and allocating the permitted mixture of uses among development
   sites; provided:
   
   
   
   (a)	The lots may be located in the same square or in different squares within
   the ARTS Overlay District;
   
   
   
   (b)	The maximum permitted floor area for all uses and the maximum floor area
   for nonresidential uses shall be calculated as if the lots were one lot, and
   the total project shall conform with both limitations;
   
   
   
   (c)	Bonus floor area earned by the provisions of § 1904 may be developed on
   any lot or combination of lots governed by the covenant required by paragraph
   (f) of this subsection; provided, no development on any lot shall exceed the
   maximum height and bulk standards in §§ 1902 and 1904.1(b), unless otherwise
   permitted by §1909; and provided further, the ground level uses required by
   § 1901.1 shall not be transferred, but shall be provided on each lot;
   
   
   
   (d)	In the underlying CR District, the provisions of this section shall apply
   in lieu of §§ 631.3 and 631.4;
   
   
   
   (e)	If a combined lot development involves the transfer of bonus density or
   allocates residential development rights from one lot to another, the
   Certificate of Occupancy for the bonus floor area for the nonresidential
   building shall not be issued until a building permit has been issued for the
   building that will provide the residential or other preferred uses;
   
   
   
   (f)	No transfer of floor area for preferred uses or of bonus floor area shall
   be effective under this section unless an instrument, legally sufficient in
   both form and content to effect such a transfer, in a form approved by the
   Office of the Attorney General, has been entered into among all of the parties
   concerned, including the District of Columbia;
   
   
   
   (g)	A certified copy of the instrument of transfer shall be filed with the
   Zoning Administrator before approval by the Department of Consumer and
   Regulatory Affairs of any building permit application affected by such
   transfer;
   
   
   
   (h)	The document shall be recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds,
   serving as a notice both to the receiving lot and sending lot of the transfer
   of floor area for preferred uses or of bonus floor areas; and
   
   
   
   (i)	The notice of restrictions and transfer shall run with the title and deed
   to each affected lot.
