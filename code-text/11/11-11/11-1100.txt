   District that is applied to selected geographic areas within and on the

   population, transportation, housing, public facilities, and environmental
   quality.

   1100.3. The incentive for hotel development is intended to encourage
   development of an adequate number of hotels within a convenient distance of

   optimum fashion, including an adequate quantity of visitor accommodations to
   serve the Center and a compatible mixture of uses within the general areas.

   the land use and other objectives of the Downtown Urban Renewal Plan and other
   public policy objectives in the area where the HR Overlay District is applied.
