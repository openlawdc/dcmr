                                  DC REGULATIONS

GENERAL PROVISIONS (SP) (§ 11-500)

500.1. The SP District (Special Purpose) is designed to stabilize those areas
   adjacent to C-3-C and C-4 Districts and other appropriate areas that contain:
   
   
   
   (a)	Existing apartments, offices, and institutions; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Mixed use buildings.

   500.2. The major purpose of the SP District shall be to act as a buffer
   between adjoining commercial and residential areas, and to ensure that new
   development is compatible in use, scale, and design with the transitional
   function of this zone district.

   500.3. The SP District is designed to preserve and protect areas adjacent to
   Commercial Districts that contain a mix of row houses, apartments, offices,
   and institutions at a medium to high density, including buildings of historic
   and architectural merit.

   500.4. The SP District is divided into SP-1 (medium density) and SP-2
   (medium-high density) Districts. In both districts, new residential
   development shall be permitted at a higher density than new office
   development, both to be compatible with surrounding properties.

   500.5. Except as provided in chapters 20 through 25 of this title, in the SP
   District, no building or premises shall be used and no building shall be
   erected or altered that is arranged, intended, or designed to be used except
   for one (1) or more of the uses listed in this chapter.

   500.6. Upon receiving an application for an approval of a use specified in
   §§ 505 and 506,508 through 510, and 512 through 515, the Board of Zoning
   Adjustment shall submit the application to the D.C. Office of Planning for
   coordination, review, report, and impact assessment, along with reviews in
   writing from all relevant District departments and agencies, including the
   Departments of Transportation and Housing and Community Development and, if a
   historic landmark or historic district is involved, the State Historic
   Preservation Officer.
