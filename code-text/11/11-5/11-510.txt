510.1. Accessory parking spaces elsewhere than on the same lot or part of the
   lot on which any principal SP use is permitted, except for a one-family
   dwelling, when the parking spaces will be established within the square in
   which the principal use is located, shall be permitted in an SP District if
   approved by the Board of Zoning Adjustment as a special exception under ยง
   3104, subject to the provisions of this section.

   510.2. [DELETED]

   510.3. The total number of parking spaces provided for the principal use shall
   not exceed the minimum number of spaces required for the principal use.

   510.4. It shall be considered economically impracticable or unsafe to locate
   the parking spaces within the principal building or on the same lot on which
   the building or use is permitted because of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Strip zoning or shallow zoning depth;
   
   
   
   (b)	Restricted size of lot caused by adverse adjoining ownership or
   substantial improvements adjoining or on the lot;
   
   
   
   (c)	Unusual topography, grades, shape, size, or dimensions of the lot;
   
   
   
   (d)	The lack of an alley or the lack of appropriate ingress or egress through
   existing or proposed alleys or streets; or
   
   
   
   (e)	Traffic hazards caused by unusual street grades or other conditions.

   510.5. The parking spaces shall be located and all facilities in relation to
   the parking spaces shall be designed so that they are not likely to become
   objectionable to adjoining or nearby property because of noise, traffic, or
   other objectionable conditions.
