2004.1. If a structure devoted to a nonconforming use is destroyed by fire,
   collapse, explosion, or act of God to an extent of more than fifty percent
   (50%) of the cost of reconstructing the entire structure, it shall not be
   restored or reconstructed except in conformity with all provisions of this
   title, except as provided otherwise in this section.

   2004.2. If the casualty or act of God results in damage to an extent of fifty
   percent (50%) or less of the cost of reconstructing the entire structure, the
   structure may be restored or reconstructed to its previous condition or to a
   more conforming condition; provided, that the reconstruction or restoration
   shall be started within twenty-four (24) months of the date of the destruction
   and diligently continued to completion.

   2004.3. If there is a dispute between the property owner and the Zoning
   Administrator as to whether the structure has been destroyed to the extent of
   fifty percent (50%) of reconstruction cost, the costs of restoration and of
   reconstruction shall be determined by the average of the estimates furnished
   by three (3) independent qualified contractors. One (1) of the contractors
   shall be selected by the owner, one (1) by the Zoning Administrator, and one
   (1) by the first two (2) mentioned contractors.

   whole or in part to a nonconforming use that is also a historic landmark or
