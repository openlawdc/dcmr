                                  DC REGULATIONS

NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES DEVOTED TO CONFORMING USES (§ 11-2001)

2001.1. The restrictions set forth in this section shall apply to a
   nonconforming structure devoted to a conforming use.

   2001.2. Except as provided in §§ 2001.11 and 2001.12, ordinary repairs,
   alterations, and modernizations to the structure, including structural
   alterations, shall be permitted.

   2001.3. Enlargements or additions may be made to the structure; provided:
   
   
   
   (a)	The structure shall conform to percentage of lot occupancy requirements,
   except as provided in § 2001.13; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The addition or enlargement itself shall:
   
   
   
   (1)	Conform to use and structure requirements; and
   
   
   
   (2)	Neither increase or extend any existing, nonconforming aspect of the
   structure; nor create any new nonconformity of structure and addition
   combined.

   2001.4. If a nonconforming structure is destroyed by fire, collapse,
   explosion, or act of God to an extent of more than seventy-five percent (75%)
   of the cost of reconstructing the entire structure, the nonconforming
   structure shall not be restored or reconstructed except in conformity with all
   provisions of this title, except as provided otherwise in §§ 2001.5 through
   2001.10.

   2001.5. If a casualty or act of God results in damage to an extent of more
   than seventy-five percent (75%), and if the structure is nonconforming only
   with respect to percentage of lot occupancy, lot area, or width of lot, the
   structure may be reconstructed or restored to its previous condition or to a
   more conforming condition, even if that condition does not comply with the
   applicable percentage of lot occupancy, lot area, or width of lot
   requirements.

   2001.6. If a casualty or act of God results in damage to an extent of
   seventy-five percent (75%) or less of the cost of reconstructing the entire
   structure, the structure may be restored or reconstructed to its previous
   condition or to a more conforming condition; provided, that the reconstruction
   or restoration shall be started within twenty-four (24) months of the date of
   the destruction and continued diligently to completion.

   2001.7. If there is a dispute between the property owner and the Zoning
   Administrator as to whether the structure has been destroyed to the extent of
   seventy-five percent (75%) of reconstruction cost, the costs of restoration
   and of reconstruction shall be determined by the average of the estimates
   furnished by three (3) independent qualified contractors. One (1) contractor
   shall be selected by the owner, one (1) by the Zoning Administrator, and one
   (1) by the first two (2) mentioned contractors.

   2001.8. The estimates required by § 2001.7 shall be prepared and submitted
   according to a standard procedure and format established by the Zoning
   Administrator, and the cost of estimates shall be at the expense of the
   property owner.

   2001.9. Notwithstanding the restrictions of § 2001.4, a nonconforming
   structure that is a historic landmark or certified by the State Historic
   Preservation Officer to be a structure that contributes to the character of
   the historic district within which it is located, may be restored or
   reconstructed regardless of the extent of destruction of the structure,
   subject to the provisions of the Historic Landmark and Historic District
   Protection Act of 1978, effective March 3, 1979, D.C. Law 2-144, as amended;
   D.C. Official Code §§ 6-1101 to 6-1115 (2001)(formerly codified at D.C. Code

   municipal laws and regulations.

   2001.10. The twenty-four (24) month period provided in § 2001.6 may be
   extended for as long as it takes to apply for and receive any governmental
   approvals necessary to accomplish the reconstruction or restoration, including
   but not limited to, approvals from the Board of Zoning Adjustment, the
   Historic Preservation Review Board, and the Mayor&#8217;s agent for the
   Historic Landmark and Historic District Protection Act.
