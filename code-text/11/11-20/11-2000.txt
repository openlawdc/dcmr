                                  DC REGULATIONS

GENERAL PROVISIONS (§ 11-2000)

2000.1. The provisions of this title shall establish separate districts, each
   of which is an appropriate area for the location of uses and structures
   permitted in that district.

   2000.2. Within the districts established by this title, or in amendments that
   may later be adopted, there exist structures, uses of land, and uses of
   structures that were lawful before this title was adopted or amended, but that
   would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this title or
   future amendments to this title. It is the intent of this title that
   nonconformities may not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, nor may they
   be used as a basis for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in
   the same district.

   2000.3. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of the separate
   districts under this title that all uses and structures incompatible with
   permitted uses or structures shall be regulated strictly and permitted only
   under rigid controls, to the extent permitted by the Zoning Act of 1938,
   approved June 20, 1938 (52 Stat, 797, as amended; D.C. Official Code §§
   6-641.01 to 641.15 (2001)(formerly codified at D.C. Code §§ 5-413 to 5-432
   (1994 Repl. &#038; 1999 Supp.))).

   2000.4. Any nonconforming use of a structure or of land, or any nonconforming
   structure lawfully existing on May 12, 1958, that remains nonconforming, and
   any use or structure lawfully existing that became nonconforming on May 12,
   1958, may be continued, operated, occupied, or maintained, subject to the
   provisions of this chapter.

   2000.5. Nonconformities shall be regulated in the following categories:
   
   
   
   (a)	Nonconforming use of land, including land use with a structure incidental
   to the use of the land;
   
   
   
   (b)	Nonconforming structure devoted to conforming use; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Nonconforming use within a structure, whether the structure is conforming
   or nonconforming.

   2000.6. A nonconforming use of land or of land with structures incidental to
   the use of the land shall neither be extended in land area nor changed to any
   use except a use permitted in the district in which the property is located.
   
   
   
   	AUTHORITY: Unless otherwise noted, the authority for this chapter is the
   Zoning Act of 1938, approved June 20, 1938 (52 Scat, 797, as amended; D.C.
   Official Code §§ 6-641.01 to 641.15 (2001) (formerly codified at D.C. Code
   §§ 5-413 to 5-432 (1994 Repl. &#038; 1999 Supp.))).
