DISCONTINUANCE (ยง 11-2005)

2005.1. Discontinuance for any reason of a nonconforming use of a structure or
   of land, except where governmental action impedes access to the premises, for
   any period of more than three (3) years, shall be construed as prima facie
   evidence of no intention to resume active operation as a nonconforming use. 
   Any subsequent use shall conform to the regulations of the district in which
   the use is located.

   2005.2. This presumption may only be rebutted by objective proof of a
   continuing use or of affirmative steps taken to resume the use during the
   period of time identified by the Zoning Administrator when revoking an
   existing certificate of occupancy or denying an application for a replacement
   certificate of occupancy.
