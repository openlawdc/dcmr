                                  DC REGULATIONS

ZONING COMMISSION REVIEW STANDARDS (SEFC) (§ 11-1808)

1808.1. In addition to proving that the proposed uses, buildings, or
   structures meet the standards set forth in § 3104.1, the applicant for Zoning
   Commission approval of a use or structure within the SEFC Overlay District
   shall further demonstrate conformance to the following standards:
   
   
   
   (a)	The use, building, or structure will help achieve the objectives of the
   SEFC Overlay District as set forth in § 1802;
   
   
   
   (b)	The proposed building or structure shall be designed with a height, bulk,
   and siting that provide for openness of view and vistas to and from the
   waterfront and, where feasible, shall maintain views of federal monumental
   buildings, particularly along the New Jersey Avenue, S.E. corridor; and
   
   
   
   (c)	On or above-grade parking adjacent to, or visible from, the street shall
   be limited. Where parking cannot be placed underground, other uses such as
   retail or residential shall separate parking areas from the street, or where
   this is not possible, green landscaping or architectural treatment of facades
   shall adequately screen parking from the street and adjacent development.

   1808.2. In evaluating the application, the Commission also may consider:
   
   
   
   (a)	Compatibility with buildings in the surrounding area through overall
   massing, siting, details, and landscaping;
   
   
   
   (b)	Use of high standards of environmental design that promote the achievement
   of sustainable development goals;
   
   
   
   (c)	Facade articulation that minimizes or eliminates the visibility of
   unarticulated blank walls from public spaces;
   
   
   
   (d)	Landscaping which complements the building;
   
   
   
   (e)	For buildings that include preferred uses in accordance with §§ 1803.3
   or 1804.3, the Commission may consider the balance and location of preferred
   uses;
   
   
   
   (f)	In connection with its review pursuant to § 1804.2, the Commission may
   consider the effect of the proposed use on the predominantly residential
   character of the R-5-D and/or R-5-E portion of the SEFC; and
   
   
   
   (g)	For development within or adjacent to the SEFC/W-0 District, the
   Commission may consider whether the project is consistent with the following
   goals:
   
   
   
   (1)	Providing a wide variety of active and passive recreational uses;
   
   
   
   (2)	Encouraging uses that open to, overlook, and benefit the waterfront park;
   
   
   
   (3)	Utilizing siting and design of buildings and uses to improve the natural
   ecology, to illustrate the importance of natural systems, and/or to interpret
   the historically important maritime context of the site.
