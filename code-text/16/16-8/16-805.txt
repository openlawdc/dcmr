INVESTIGATION OF APPLICANTS AND LICENSEES (ยง 16-805)

805.1. The Director is authorized, in connection with the consideration of
   license applications and from time to time during the license year, during
   regular business hours, to require any applicant or licensee to make available
   to the Director such information as the Director considers necessary in
   determining or verifying whether the applicant or licensee has or retains the
   qualifications necessary for obtaining or retaining a license, or has violated
   or failed to comply with any provision of statute or regulation relating to
   the conduct of the home improvement business or to obtaining or retaining a
   license.

   805.2. The investigation by the Director may include determination or
   verification of the identity of any person associated with the applicant or
   licensee in the home improvement business, and the extent, if any, of that
   person&#8217;s control, either directly or indirectly, over the business
   activities of the applicant or licensee.

   805.3. Failure to make information available to the Director; failure to
   furnish to the Director the information the Director is authorized to request
   by this section; or failure to furnish to the Director or to permit the
   Director to make one (1) or more copies of such records maintained by the
   applicant or licensee as the Director may specify, shall be grounds for
   denial, suspension, or revocation of a license.

   805.4. The information required by this section to be furnished to the
   Director may, at the option of the applicant or licensee, be furnished to the
   Director at the Director&#8217;s office or, upon notice to the Director, at
   the place of business of the applicant or licensee.
