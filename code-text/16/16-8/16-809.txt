                                  DC REGULATIONS

ACTIONS BY SALESPERSONS (ยง 16-809)

809.1. For purposes of this chapter, the act or omission of any salesperson of
   a contractor while acting or purportedly acting on behalf of the contractor,
   which act or omission is in violation of this chapter or is cause for denial,
   suspension, or revocation of the license of a contractor, may be considered
   the act of the contractor by whom that salesperson is employed, or for whom he
   or she purported to act, if the contractor approves the act, or, after actual
   notice of the act or omission, retains the benefit, proceeds, profit, or
   advantage accruing from the act or omission or otherwise ratifies it.

   809.2. If there is a bona fide dispute as to whether the act or omission was
   committed or occurred, the contractor is not deemed to have had actual notice
   of it until it shall have been finally determined that the act or omission was
   in fact committed or did in fact occur.

   809.3. Regardless of the validity of his or her salesperson&#8217;s license,
   no salesperson may negotiate, or arrange or attempt to arrange the negotiation
   of contracts for home improvement work for or on behalf of a contract while
   the contractor&#8217;s license is suspended or revoked.
