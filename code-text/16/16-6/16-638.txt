638.1. The consumer goods repair dealer shall make available to the customer
   the repaired goods, together with the final bill, on or before the promised
   date specified on the written estimate (or specified orally and noted on the

   anticipated completion date is provided, in advance of the original date on
   which the goods were promised.

   638.2. If a repair is delayed beyond the promised completion date, the
   customer shall have the right upon request to prompt return of the goods.

   638.3. In requesting a return under ยง 638.2, the customer shall specify

   lesser condition of assembly as the customer shall designate as acceptable.

   638.4. Regardless of the state of assembly of the goods chosen by the customer
   under ยง 638.3, if the delay is caused solely by circumstances beyond the

   entitled to charge the customer for the value of the services and parts
   supplied.

   638.5. An exact accounting of all services and parts shall be given to the
