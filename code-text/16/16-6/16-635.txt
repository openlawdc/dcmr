635.1. The following shall be exempt from the estimate requirements of §§
   633 and 634:
   
   
   
   (a)	Repairs, the estimated cost of which is fifteen dollars ($ 15) or less,
   including service charges and other miscellaneous items;
   
   
   
   (b)	Repairs which, because of parts and labor warranty or other reason, are
   performed at no cost to the customer; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Repairs performed totally in a residence; Provided, that the customer upon
   calling the consumer goods repair dealer to come to the customer&#8217;s home,
   specifically waives the estimate requirement because neither the customer nor
   an authorized adult agent for the customer will be present in the home when
   the goods are inspected and repairs performed.

   635.2. The final costs for repairs exempt under § 635.1(a) shall not exceed
   the original estimate by more than twenty percent (20%), including tax and
   other charges.

   635.3. The previous waiver of the estimate requirement under § 635.1(c) shall
   be inapplicable if the customer or an agent previously authorized by the
   customer is present when the goods are inspected for repair.
