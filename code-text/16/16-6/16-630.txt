   the consumer goods repair industry in the District. The sign shall be
   conspicuously posted in the business transaction areas of all repair service
   facilities.

   630.2. Prior to making any home visit for the purpose of making repairs or

   630.3. A consumer goods repair dealer may reserve the right to require
   customers to authorize in writing any substantive changes in or additions to
   repairs authorized by the customer.

   630.4. If there is a dispute between the customer and the consumer goods
   repair dealer regarding charges, adequacy of service, or compliance with any
   of the provisions of this chapter, the consumer goods repair dealer shall have
   a lien by operation of law on the goods, if the customer refuses to pay the
   charges itemized on the written estimate, until the dispute has been resolved
   by referral to and action by the Department, as provided in §§ 620 through
   623, unless the customer posts a bond or security according to rules
   promulgated by the Department.

   630.5. If a repair dealer subcontracts repair services on consumer goods or
