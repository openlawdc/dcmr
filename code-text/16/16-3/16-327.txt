                                  DC REGULATIONS

REFUND OF INSURANCE PREMIUMS (ยง 16-327)

327.1. If insurance for which a charge is included in a retail installment
   contract is canceled or the premium adjusted, any refund of the insurance
   premium received by the holder shall be credited to installments of the
   instrument of security maturing thereafter.

   327.2. Except to the extent that the refund is applied toward payment for
   similar insurance protecting the interests of the buyer and the holder, or
   either of them, it shall be applied to the earliest installment of the
   contract maturing thereafter; or at the option of the holder, the refund (plus
   interest thereon at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum from the date on
   which the refund becomes available to the date it is applied to the
   indebtedness of the purchaser) may be applied to installments maturing
   subsequent to the earliest installments.
