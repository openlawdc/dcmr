PREPAYMENT AND REFUNDS (ยง 16-337)

337.1. Notwithstanding the provisions of any instrument of security or
   refinancing contract to the contrary, any buyer may, at any time before
   maturity, prepay the balance due under that instrument or contract in full in
   cash or, with the approval of the holder, by extension, renewal, or otherwise.

   337.2. If any buyer prepays the balance due under an instrument of security or
   a refinancing contract, as provided in this section, the buyer shall be
   entitled to receive a refund of finance charges computed according to the
   actuarial method, as described by the federal Truth in Lending Act (82 Stat.
   149; 15 U.S.C. ยง 1606(a)(1)(A); 5-29-68) and the regulations issued under
   that Act.

   337.3. If any charge is included in a retail installment contract for credit
   life insurance, and that retail installment contract is prepaid in full prior
   to maturity, the holder shall refund or cause to be refunded to the buyer a
   portion of the credit life insurance charge which shall be not less than an
   amount computed under the formula commonly referred to as the &#8220;actuarial
   rebate formula&#8221; as soon as the buyer does either of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Surrenders the policy or other evidence of insurance to the holder, or
   
   
   
   (b)	Furnishes a lost-policy release to the holder.

   337.4. No refund shall be required in any case under ยง 337.3 which, when
   computed by the actuarial rebate formula, would be less than one dollar ($ 1).
