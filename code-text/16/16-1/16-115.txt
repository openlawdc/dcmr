PROHIBITED CONTRACT FORM PROVISIONS (§ 16-115)

115.1. No person subject to this chapter shall use any contract form or any
   other instrument arising in connection with a retail installment transaction
   which contains any of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Any schedule of payments under which any one installment, except the
   downpayment, is not equal or substantially equal to all other installments,
   excluding the downpayment, or under which the intervals between any
   consecutive installments differ substantially, except as follows:
   
   
   
   (1)	The intervals for the first installment payment may be longer or shorter
   than the other intervals;
   
   
   
   (2)	The final installment payment may be less in amount than the preceding
   installment payment; and
   
   
   
   (3)	If a buyer&#8217;s livelihood is dependent upon seasonal or intermittent
   income, the seller and the buyer may agree that one or more installment
   payments in the schedule of payments may be reduced or deferred;
   
   
   
   (b)	Any provision for the acceleration of the time when any part or all of the
   indebtedness becomes payable other than for a substantial default in payment
   or performance by the buyer, or on the same grounds that would authorize an
   attachment before judgment under D.C. Code §§ 16-501(d)(3)-(5) (1981 Ed.);
   
   
   
   (c)	Any provision by which the buyer agrees not to assert against a seller, or
   against an assignee, any claim or defense arising from the sale of the
   consumer goods or services which are the subject matter of the contract;
   
   
   
   (d)	Any provision by which the buyer grants authority to the seller or
   assignee to enter the buyer&#8217;s premises without consent of the buyer
   obtained immediately prior to entering the premises to repossess the
   collateral, if any;
   
   
   
   (e)	Any provision by which the buyer waives any right of action against the
   seller, assignee, or other person acting on behalf of either, for any illegal
   act committed in the collection of payments under the contract or in the
   repossession of goods;
   
   
   
   (f)	Any provision whereby the buyer executes a power of attorney appointing
   the seller, assignee, or other persons acting in the seller&#8217;s behalf, as
   the buyer&#8217;s agent in the collection of payments under the contract or in
   the repossession of collateral security;
   
   
   
   (g)	Any provision for the payment by the buyer of attorney&#8217;s fees
   incurred by the seller or the seller&#8217;s assignee in the collection of the
   debt created by the contract; or
   
   
   
   (h)	Any provision permitting a seller or seller&#8217;s assignee on default of
   the buyer to take possession of the goods sold under the contract, unless the
   contract expressly waives all claims against the buyer for any deficiency
   between the proceeds of the disposition and the outstanding balance due on the
   contract.

   115.2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any written
   provision in a retail installment contract or agreement which provides for
   settlement by arbitration of any controversy thereafter arising out of or
   related to the contract or agreement or breach of the contract or agreement,
   or any agreement in writing to submit to arbitration of any controversy, shall
   not be unenforceable or made invalid by reason of this chapter.
