FAILURE TO MAKE OR COOPERATE IN DISCOVERY; SANCTIONS (ยง 27-113)

113.1. Before any motion to compel discovery is filed, the affected parties or
   counsel must meet for a reasonable period of time in an effort to resolve the
   disputed matter. The movant shall include in any motion to compel discovery
   with a certification that despite a good faith effort to secure it, the
   discovery material sought has not been provided. This certification shall set
   forth specific facts describing the good faith effort, including a statement
   of the date, time, and place of the meeting required by this rule.

   113.2. If a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, the
   Board may make:
   
   
   
   (a)	An order that certain facts shall be taken to be established in accordance
   with the claim of the moving party;
   
   
   
   (b)	An order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose
   designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting that party from introducing
   designated matters in evidence;
   
   
   
   (c)	An order striking pleadings, staying further proceedings until the order
   is obeyed, dismissing the case or proceeding or any part thereof, or rendering
   a judgment by default against the disobedient party; or
   
   
   
   (d)	An order imposing such other sanctions as the Board deems appropriate.

   113.3. When the Board believes that the circumstances warrant either
   dismissing the case or rendering a default judgment against the disobedient
   party as a discovery sanction, it will issue an order to show cause pursuant
   to Rule 121.3.
