   the day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time
   begins to run shall not be included.

   122.2. The last day of each period computed pursuant to Rule 122.1 shall be
   included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, or, when the act
   to be done is the filing of a paper with the Board, a day or any part of a day

   completed (&#8220;authorized date and time&#8221;), provided, however, for the
   purpose of computing time for the served party to respond, any notice or
