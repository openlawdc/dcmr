SUMMARY DISPOSITION OF PROTESTS (ยง 27-308)

308.1. When a protest is, on its face, invalid or untimely filed, or otherwise
   not for consideration, the Board shall summarily dismiss the protest without
   requiring submission of an Agency Report.

   308.2. Frivolous Protests. The Board may dismiss, at any stage of the
   proceedings, any protest, or portion of a protest, it deems frivolous. In
   addition, the Board may require the protester to pay the agency attorney fees,
   at the rate of $100 per hour, for time counsel spent representing the agency
   in defending the frivolous protest or its frivolous part. If the entire
   protest is dismissed on frivolous grounds, it may also assess the protester
   damages for each day the contract was suspended equal to the amount of
   liquidated damages specified in the contract for late completion of the
   contract. The Board shall not determine damages, if liquidated damages are not
   specified in the contract. In addition, counsel for the protester may be
   suspended or barred from practicing before the Board.

   308.3. A motion for assessment of agency attorney fees and/or damages on
   account of defending against a frivolous protest shall be submitted by the
   contracting agency during protest proceedings or within twenty (20) days of
   receipt of a Board decision determining that a protest in whole or in part was
   frivolous.

   308.4. The motion shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation supporting
   the requested costs and/or damages.

   308.5. The protester may, within fifteen (15) days after its receipt of the
   contracting agency&#8217;s motion, file a written response to the motion.
