                                  DC REGULATIONS

BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS (ยง 27-1802)

1802.1. A blanket purchase agreement (BPA) is not a contract and may be
   established without a purchase requisition or the obligation of funds.

   1802.2. The contracting officer may use a BPA as a small purchase procedure to
   fill anticipated repetitive needs for goods or services by establishing charge
   accounts with sources of supply if at least one (1) of the following criteria
   apply:
   
   
   
   (a)	There is a wide variety of items in a broad class of goods or services
   that are generally purchased, but the exact items, quantities, and delivery
   requirements are not known in advance and may vary considerably; or
   
   
   
   	(b)	The administrative cost of writing numerous purchase orders can be
   			avoided through the use of this procedure.

   1802.3. The contracting officer shall not use a BPA to:
   
   
   
   		(a)	Procure goods or services for which a requirements type contract has
   been 			issued by the District; or
   
   
   
   	(b)	Avoid the small purchase authority limitation.

   1802.4. The contracting officer shall include the following information in
   each BPA:
   
   
   
   (a)	A statement that the supplier will furnish goods or services, described in
   general terms, if and when requested by the contracting officer during a
   specified period and within a stipulated total amount;
   
   
   
   	(b)	A statement that the District is obligated only to the extent that
   authorized 			purchases are actually made under the BPA;
   
   
   
   (c)	A statement that the prices to the District shall be as low or lower than
   those charged to the supplier&#8217;s most favored customer for comparable
   	quantities under similar terms and conditions, in addition to any discounts
   for prompt payment;
   
   
   
   (d)	A statement that specifies the dollar limitation for purchases under the
   BPA (not to exceed the small purchase limit); and
   
   
   
   (e)	A requirement that all deliveries or shipments under the BPA shall be
   accompanied by delivery tickets or sales slips which contain the following
   minimum information:
   
   
   
   		(i)	The name of the supplier;
   
   
   
   		(ii)	The BPA number;
   
   
   
   		(iii)	The date of purchase;
   
   
   
   		(iv)	The purchase order number;
   
   
   
   		(v)	An itemized list of goods or services furnished;
   
   
   
   		(vi)	The quantity, unit price, and extension of each item, less applicable
   			discounts; and
   
   
   
   		(vii)	The date of delivery or shipment.

   1802.5. To the extent practicable, BPAs for items of the same type shall be
   placed 	concurrently with more than one (1) supplier.  All competitive sources
   shall be 	given an equal opportunity to furnish goods, services, or other
   items under a BPA.

   1802.6. When there are an insufficient number of vendors with BPAs to ensure
   maximum 	practicable competition for a particular purchase, the contracting
   officer shall:
   
   
   
   		(a)	Solicit quotations from other sources and make the purchase as
   				appropriate; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Establish additional BPA&#8217;s to facilitate future purchases when
   recurring requirements for the same or similar items or services seem likely,
   when qualified sources are willing to accept a BPA, or when it is otherwise
   practical to do so.

   1802.7. A BPA shall be considered terminated when the procurements under it
   are equal to its total dollar limitation or when the stated time period
   expires.
