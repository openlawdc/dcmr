UNPRICED PURCHASE ORDERS (ยง 27-1803)

1803.1. The contracting officer shall use an unpriced purchase order only
   under the following circumstances:
   
   
   
   		(a)	When the transaction will not exceed the small purchase limit;
   
   
   
   (b)	When it is impractical to obtain pricing in advance of issuance of the
   purchase order; and
   
   
   
   (c)	When the purchase is for repairs to equipment requiring disassembly to
   determine the nature and extent of repairs, material is available from only
   one (1) source, and for which cost cannot be readily established, or goods or
   services for which prices are known to be competitive but exact prices are not
   known.

   1803.2. The contracting officer shall issue each unpriced purchase order by
   using a purchase order form and shall set a realistic dollar ceiling, either
   for each line item or for the total order.  The dollar limitation shall be an
   obligation subject to adjustment when the firm price is established.
