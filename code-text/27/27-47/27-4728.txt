CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS (§ 27-4728)

4728.1. The Contracting Officer may modify a contract subject to the
   provisions of this section.

   4728.2. A modification must be within the general scope of the original
   contract.  Any requirement for extra work that goes beyond the contract’s
   general scope shall be the subject of a new procurement.

   4728.3. The CCO shall approve a contract modification in excess of one hundred
   thousand dollars ($100,000).

   4728.4. A contract modification may be effected:
   
   
   
   (a)	By a bilateral agreement executed by the Contracting Officer and an
   authorized representative of the contractor; or
   
   
   
   (b)	By the Contracting Officer’s issuance of a unilateral written change,
   when the contract includes a changes clause permitting the Department to make
   unilateral changes in the contract work.  Under such a clause, the contractor
   is obligated to perform in accordance with a change order issued by the
   Contracting Officer, and the contract price is adjusted to reflect the
   increase or decrease in costs caused by the change.
