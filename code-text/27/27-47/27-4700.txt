   purposes of these rules are to ensure that the Department’s procurement
   activities:
   
   
   
   (a)	Are carried out in a fair and objective manner that promotes confidence in
   the Department’s integrity; and

   determined by the Director of Department of General Services, or his or her
   designee (hereinafter Director).

   (a)	Such waiver is in the best interest of the Department;
   
   
   
   (b)	Such waiver is not inconsistent with fair, competitive, and transparent
   procurement practices; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Such waiver is technical in nature and would not alter the substantive
   business terms of a procurement after proposals are received.
