                                  DC REGULATIONS

PAYMENT REQUESTS (§ 27-4726)

4726.1. Requests for payment must be submitted in writing by the contractor. 
   Payment shall not be authorized without a valid written contract.

   4726.2. Contractor payment requests shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	Certify that the contractor is entitled to payment in the requested
   amount; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Include or attach any information necessary to demonstrate entitlement to
   the requested payment under the contract’s terms.

   4726.3. Depending on the contract’s payment provisions, a payment request
   may consist of, for example, a statement that specified work has been
   completed in a satisfactory manner, documentation showing that contract
   deliverables have been accepted by the Office, or information detailing the
   reimbursable costs incurred by the contractor.

   4726.4. Unless the Contracting Officer authorizes the payments, they shall not
   be made.  A Contracting Officer’s payment authorization shall not preclude
   the Department from seeking repayment or pursuing other remedies if it
   subsequently concludes that the contractor was overpaid or otherwise mispaid.

   4726.5. In addition to the Contracting Officer’s payment authorization, the
   Department’s CFO or his or her designee shall certify and approve all
   payment requests prior to making any payment.
