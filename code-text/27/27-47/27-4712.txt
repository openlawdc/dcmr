                                  DC REGULATIONS

FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS (§ 27-4712)

4712.1. Fixed-price contracts include several variants:
   
   (a)	Firm, fixed-price contracts;
   
   (b)	Fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment; and
   
   (c)	Fixed-price incentive contracts.

   4712.2. Unlike cost reimbursement contracts, any type of fixed-price contract
   obligates the contractor to complete the contractually-specified work for a
   fixed price.

   4712.3. A firm fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject
   to adjustment, except in the event of a change to the contract work.

   4712.4. A fixed-price contract with economic price adjustment provides for an
   upward or downward adjustment in the stated contract price based on changes in
   certain benchmarks specifically identified in the contract (for example,
   catalog prices or the producer price index for a particular commodity),
   subject to a ceiling on upward adjustments.

   4712.5. A fixed-price incentive contract generally provides for establishing a
   final price by applying a formula based on the relationship between the total
   cost actually incurred by the contractor and a total target cost.  A fixed
   price incentive contract results in the parties sharing in the cost savings or
   increases associated with differences between the actual and target cost. 
   These contracts also can include incentive formulas based on the
   contractor’s schedule or technical performance.
