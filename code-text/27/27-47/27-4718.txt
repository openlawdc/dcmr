SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENTS (§ 27-4718)

4718.1. The Contracting Officer may award contracts on a sole-source basis
   only if the goods or services sought by the Department are available from only
   one (1) source.

   4718.2. Prior to entering into a sole-source contract, the Contracting Officer
   shall first make a determination and finding justifying the sole source
   procurement; provided, however, that if the sole-source contract will be in an
   amount over two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000), the CCO’s
   approval shall also be required.  If the Contracting Officer makes a
   determination pursuant to subsection 4718.1 that a sole source procurement is
   necessary to meet an essential requirement of the Office, the Contracting
   Officer shall document such determination in writing and may procure goods,
   services, or construction without regard to the procedures set forth in
   sections 4719 through 4724.  In all other cases, the Contracting Officer shall
   use the procedures specified in sections 4719 through 4724.

   4718.3. A written determination by the Contracting Officer supporting a single
   available source procurement pursuant to subsection 4718.1 shall include:
   
   
   
   (a)	A description of the nature of the goods or services;
   
   
   
   (b)	An explanation of why the goods or services are available from a single
   source; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The intended sole source contractor.

   4718.4. Notice of the Department’s intent to enter into a sole source
   contract shall be posted on the Department’s website at least ten (10) days
   prior to the award of such contract and shall include the information set
   forth in subsection 4718.3.
