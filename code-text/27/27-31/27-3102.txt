INDEMNIFICATION (ยง 27-3102)

3102.1. The contracting officer shall not include in any solicitation or
   contract any provision by which the District expressly agrees to indemnify the
   contractor against liability for patent or copyright infringement or
   misappropriation of proprietary information.

   3102.2. The contracting officer shall ensure that each contract requiring
   indemnification includes an indemnity clause, approved by the Director,
   providing for reimbursement of the District for any liability incurred as the
   result of an infringement of rights in patents, copyrights, or proprietary
   information.

   3102.3. The contracting officer shall not require the inclusion of an
   indemnity clause in the following situations:
   
   
   
   (a)	When the contract is awarded using the small purchase procedures under
   chapter 18 of this title; or
   
   
   
   (b)	When the contract is solely for architect-engineer services.

   3102.4. If it is in the best interests of the District to exempt one (1) or
   more specific United States patents from a patent indemnity clause, the
   contracting officer may grant the exemption upon written approval of the
   Director. The contracting officer shall include the Director&#8217;s written
   approval in the contract file, and shall include a clause in the contract that
   allows for waiver of indemnity of one (1) or more specific patents.
