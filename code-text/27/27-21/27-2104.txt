ORDERING FROM THE SUPPLY SCHEDULES (ยง 27-2104)

2104.1. When ordering from a single-award schedule, the contracting officer
   shall place orders directly with the schedule contractor at the price shown in
   the schedule.

   2104.2. Except as provided in ยง2104.3, when ordering from a multiple-award
   schedule, the contracting officer shall place orders with the schedule
   contractor offering the lowest delivered price available.

   2104.3. The contracting officer shall justify any order over five hundred
   dollars ($500) per line item placed at other than the lowest price.
   Justification for ordering a higher priced item may be based on any of the
   following considerations:
   
   
   
   (a)	Delivery time in terms of actual need that cannot be met by a contractor
   offering a lower price;
   
   
   
   (b)	Specific or unusual requirements, such as differences in performance
   characteristics;
   
   
   
   (c)	Compatibility with existing equipment or systems; or
   
   
   
   (d)	Trade-in considerations that favor a higher priced item and produce the
   lowest net cost.
