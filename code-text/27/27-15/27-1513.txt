                                  DC REGULATIONS

PREQUALIFICATION PROCESS (§ 27-1513)

1513.1. Before issuing an IFB, the contracting officer may prequalify bidders
   by
   
   establishing a prequalification process to certify the financial and
   professional qualifications of prospective bidders.

   1513.2. The contracting officer may use a prequalification process when he or
   she
   
   determines that this process will be the most advantageous to the District.
   The contracting officer may limit participation in certain procurements to
   prospective contractors who have been prequalified under the process.

   1513.3. The contracting officer shall conduct the prequalification process as
   follows:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The contracting officer shall first advertise a Request for Qualifications
   pursuant to chapter 13 of this title, for prospective bidders to submit
   financial and professional responsibility information; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   	The contracting officer may only issue an IFB to those prospective bidders
   determined to be qualified after evaluation of the responses to the Request
   for Qualifications.  Only qualified prospective bidders may submit bids in
   response to the IFB.

   1513.4. The Request for Qualifications shall include, at a minimum:
   
   
   
   (a)  	A detailed description of the contract requirements; and
   
   
   
   (b)  	Submission requirements that will be used to determine whether a
   prospective bidder is qualified.

   1513.5. The contracting officer may conduct oral or written discussions with
   prospective bidders who submitted responses to the Request for Qualifications.

   1513.6. The contracting officer may provide the information submitted by all
   prospective bidders in response to the request to an evaluation panel.  The
   panel may recommend to the contracting officer, based upon the panel’s
   analysis of the information according to the criteria set forth in the
   request, whether a prospective bidder is qualified.

   1513.7. After determining the most qualified prospective bidders, the
   contracting officer shall issue an IFB only to the bidders who have been
   determined most qualified.

   1513.8. The IFB shall not be advertised in newspapers or publicly posted.

   1513.9. The use of the prequalification process shall not nullify the
   requirement for a determination of contractor responsibility under chapter 22
   of this title.
