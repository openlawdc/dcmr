                                  DC REGULATIONS

MINOR INFORMALITIES OR IRREGULARITIES IN BIDS (ยง 27-1535)

1535.1. The contracting officer may determine that it is in the best interest
   of the 			District to waive a minor informality or irregularity in a bid or to
   give a 			bidder an opportunity to cure the deficiency.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The contracting officer may determine that the following, among others, are
   minor informalities or irregularities:
   
   
   
   (a)  	When a bidder fails to return the number of copies of signed bids
   required by the IFB;
   
   
   
   (b)  	When the bidder fails to furnish information concerning the number of
   its employees;
   
   
   
   (c)  	When a bidder fails to sign its bid, but only if one (1) of the
   following applies:
   
   
   
    (1)   	The unsigned bid is accompanied by other material indicating the
   bidder&#8217;s intention to be bound by the unsigned bid (such as the
   submission of a bid guarantee or a letter signed by the bidder, with the bid,
   referring to and clearly identifying the bid itself); or
   
   
   
   (2)  	The firm submitting the bid has formally adopted or authorized, before
   the time set for bid opening, the execution of documents by typewritten,
   printed or stamped signature; submits evidence of that authorization; and the
   bid carries the proper signature; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   When a bidder fails to acknowledge receipt of an amendment to the IFB, but
   only if one (1) of the following applies:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
    The bid received clearly indicates that the bidder received the amendment
   (such as where the amendment added another item to the IFB and the bidder
   submitted a bid on the item); or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The amendment involves only a matter of form or has either no effect or merely
   a negligible effect on price, quantity, quality, or delivery of the item bid
   upon.

   1535.3. When a bidder fails to provide timely certifications or information
   with respect to Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Programs, the
   contracting officer may allow additional time to submit the information prior
   to contract award.
