POSTPONEMENT OF BID OPENING (ยง 27-1528)

1528.1. The contracting officer may postpone a bid opening until after the
   time scheduled for bid opening under the following circumstances:
   
   
   
   (a)   	If the contracting officer has reason to believe that the bids of an
   important segment of bidders have been delayed in the mail or in the
   electronic system specified for transmission of bids, for causes beyond the
   control of bidders and without their fault or negligence, such as flood, fire,
   accident, weather conditions, strikes, or District equipment blackout or
   malfunction when bids are due; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
    	If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal governmental
   processes so that the conduct of bid openings as scheduled is impractical.

   1528.2. At the time of a determination to postpone a bid opening, an
   announcement of the determination shall be publicly posted.  If practical,
   before issuance of a formal amendment to the IFB, the determination shall be
   otherwise communicated to prospective bidders.

   1528.3. When a bid opening is postponed, the time of the rescheduled bid
   opening shall be communicated to prospective bidders.

   1528.4. The contracting officer may proceed with bid opening as soon as
   practical after the original scheduled bid opening time without amendment to
   the IFB or notice to bidders whenever any delay incident to the issuance of
   the amendment or notice would not be in the best interest of the District.
