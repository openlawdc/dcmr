1536.1. After bid opening, the contracting officer shall examine each bid for
   mistakes.

   1536.2. In cases of apparent mistakes and when the contracting officer has
   reason to believe that a mistake may have been made, the contracting officer
   shall request from the bidder a verification of the bid and call attention to
   the suspected mistake.

   1536.3. If the bidder alleges a mistake, the matter shall be processed before
   award in accordance with this section.

   1536.4. If the mistake and the intended correct bid are clearly evident on the
   face 			of the bid document, the bid shall be corrected to the intended
   correct bid 			and may not be withdrawn. Examples of mistakes that may be
   clearly 			evident on the face of the bid document are typographical errors,
   errors in 			extending unit prices, 	transposition errors, and arithmetical
   errors.

   1536.5. If the mistake and the intended correct bid are not clearly evident, a
   bidder 		may be permitted to withdraw a low bid if:
   
   (a)  	A mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document but the
   intended correct bid is not similarly evident; or
   
   (b)  	The bidder submits proof of evidentiary value which clearly and
   convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made.

   1536.6. The authority to permit corrections of bids is limited to bids that,
   as submitted, are responsive to the IFB, and shall not be used to permit
   correction of bids to make them responsive.

   1536.7. Correction of bids submitted by electronic means shall be effected by
   			including in the electronic solicitation file the original bid, the
   verification 			request, and the bid verification.

   1536.8. When a bid is corrected or withdrawn, or correction or withdrawal is
   denied, the contracting officer shall prepare a determination showing that the
   relief was granted or denied in accordance with this section.
