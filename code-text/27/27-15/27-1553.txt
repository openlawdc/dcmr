                                  DC REGULATIONS

RECEIPT AND EVALUATION OF STEP ONE PROPOSALS (§ 27-1553)

1553.1. Upon receipt of proposals, the contracting officer shall:
   
   
   
   (a)  	Safeguard the proposals against disclosure to unauthorized persons;
   
   
   
   (b)  	Accept and handle data with restrictive disclosure procedures in
   accordance with chapter 31 of this title; and
   
   
   
   (c)  	Remove any reference to price or cost.

   1553.2. The contracting officer shall establish a time period for evaluating
   	technical proposals. The time period may vary with the complexity and the
   	number of proposals received.

   1553.3. Proposal evaluations shall be based on the criteria specified in the
   request 	for technical proposals without consideration of responsibility.

   1553.4. Proposals shall be categorized as one (1) of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)  	Acceptable;
   
   
   
   (b)  	Reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable; or
   
   
   
   (c)  	Unacceptable.

   1553.5. Any proposal which modifies or fails to conform to the essential
   	requirements or specifications of the request for technical proposals shall
   	be considered 	nonresponsive and categorized as unacceptable.

   1553.6. The contracting officer may proceed directly with step two if:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   There are a sufficient number of acceptable proposals to ensure adequate price
   competition under step two;  and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Further time, effort and delay to make additional proposals acceptable, and
   thereby increase competition, would not be in the best interest of the
   District.

   1553.7. If it is not in the best interest of the District to proceed directly
   with step 	two, the contracting officer shall request bidders whose proposals
   may be 	made acceptable to submit additional clarifying or supplemental
   	information.

   1553.8. If discussions are held, the contracting officer must identify the
   nature of 	the deficiencies in the proposal or the nature of the additional
   information 	required.

   1553.9. No proposal shall be discussed with any bidder other than the
   submitting 	bidder.

   1553.10. When initiating a request for additional information, the contracting
   	officer shall fix an appropriate time for bidders to conclude discussions, if
   	any, submit all additional information, and incorporate that additional
   	information as part of their proposals.

   1553.11. The time for completing the actions under § 1553.10 may be extended
   at 	the contracting officer’s discretion.

   1553.12. If the additional information incorporated as part of a proposal
   within the 	final time fixed by the contracting officer establishes that the
   proposal is 	acceptable, it shall be so categorized. Otherwise, it shall be
   categorized as 	unacceptable.

   1553.13. If a technical proposal is found unacceptable, either initially or
   after 	clarification, the contracting officer shall promptly notify the bidder
   of the 	basis of the determination and notify the bidder that a revision of
   its 	proposal will not be considered.

   1553.14. Upon written request, and as soon as possible after award, the
   contracting 	officer may debrief unsuccessful bidders in accordance with the
   provisions 	of chapter 16 of this title.

   1553.15. If it is necessary to discontinue the two-step sealed bidding method,
   the 	contracting officer shall include a statement of the facts and
   circumstances 	in the contract file.

   1553.16. Each bidder shall be notified, in writing, of a discontinuance of the
   two-	step sealed bidding process.
