                                  DC REGULATIONS

MISTAKES IN BIDS AFTER AWARD (§ 27-1537)

1537.1. If a mistake in a bid is not discovered until after award, the mistake
   may be corrected by contract amendment if correcting the mistake would be
   favorable to the District without changing the essential requirements of the
   specifications.

   1537.2. In addition to the cases contemplated in § 1537.1, or as otherwise
   authorized by law, if a mistake in a bid is not discovered until after the
   contract is awarded, the Director shall make one (1) of the following
   determinations:
   
   
   
   (a)  	Rescind the contract;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Reform the contract to delete the items involved in the mistake or to reform
   the contract to increase the price if the contract price, as corrected, does
   not exceed that of the next lowest acceptable bid under the original IFB; or
   
   
   
   	(c)  	Make no change to the contract as awarded.

   1537.3. Determinations made under §§ 1537.2(a) and 1537.2(b) shall be made
   only on the basis of clear and convincing evidence that a mistake was mutual
   or unilaterally made by a contractor, and was so apparent as to give the
   contracting officer notice of the probability of the mistake.
