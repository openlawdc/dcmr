NEGOTIATIONS AFTER CANCELLATION (§ 27-1531)

1531.1. By determination, the Director may authorize the use of negotiations
   if an IFB is canceled after bid opening for any of the following reasons:
   
   
   
   (a)  	All otherwise acceptable bids received are at unreasonable prices, or
   only one (1) bid is received and the contracting officer cannot determine the
   reasonableness of the bid price;
   
   
   
   (b) 	 The bids were not independently arrived at in open competition, were	
   collusive, or were submitted in bad faith; or
   
   
   
   (c)  	No responsive bid has been received from a responsible bidder.

   1531.2. If the Director determines that an IFB should be canceled and that the
   use of negotiations is in the District’s best interest, the contracting
   officer may negotiate and award a contract without issuing a new solicitation,
   provided that:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   All responsible bidders under the IFB have been given notice that negotiations
   shall be conducted and have been given the opportunity to participate in the
   negotiations; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The contract is awarded to the responsible bidder with the lowest negotiated
   price.
