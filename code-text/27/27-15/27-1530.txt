                                  DC REGULATIONS

CANCELLATION OF AN INVITATION FOR BIDS AFTER OPENING (§ 27-1530)

1530.1. An IFB may be canceled, or all bids rejected, only if the Director
   determines that the action taken is in the best interest of the District.  If
   all bids have been rejected, the contracting officer shall cancel the
   solicitation.

   1530.2. After bid opening, an IFB shall not be canceled and resolicited due
   solely to increased requirements for the items being procured.  Contract award
   shall be made on the initial IFB and any additional quantity shall be treated
   as a new procurement.

   1530.3. After bid opening, an IFB may be canceled and all bids rejected before
   being awarded if the Director determines that cancellation is in the best
   interest of the District for any reason, including the following:
   
   
   
   (a)  	Inadequate or ambiguous specifications were cited in the IFB;
   
   
   
   (b)  	Specifications have been revised;
   
   
   
   (c)  	The goods or services being contracted for are no longer required;
   
   
   
   (d)  	The IFB did not provide for consideration of all factors of cost to the
   District;
   
   
   
   (e)  	Bids received indicate that the needs of the District can be satisfied
   by a less expensive article differing from that for which the bids were
   invited;
   
   
   
   (f)  	All otherwise acceptable bids received are at unreasonable prices, or
   only one (1) bid is received and the contracting officer cannot determine the
   reasonableness of the bid price;
   
   
   
   (g)  	No responsive bid has been received from a responsible bidder; or
   
   
   
   (h)  	The bids were not independently arrived at in open competition, were
   collusive, or were submitted in bad faith.

   1530.4. If administrative difficulties arise after bid opening which may delay
   award beyond the bidders’ acceptance period, the contracting officer should
   request the lowest bidders to extend the bid acceptance period (with consent
   of sureties, if any) in order to avoid the need for readvertisement.

   1530.5. The contracting officer shall post on the Internet a notice of
   cancellation which shall briefly explain the reason the IFB is being canceled.
