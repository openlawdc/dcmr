DESCRIPTIVE LITERATURE (ยง 27-1507)

Each IFB shall state whether the bidder is required to furnish descriptive
literature.

literature unless the contracting officer needs it to determine, before award,
whether the product offered meets the specifications or to establish exactly
what the bidder proposes to furnish.







	The contracting officer shall document, in writing, the reasons why product
acceptability cannot be determined without submission of descriptive literature
and shall include the document in the contract file.







	The IFB shall clearly identify the following:



(a)  	The descriptive literature required to be furnished;



(b)  	The purpose for which the literature is required;



(c)  	The extent to which the literature shall be considered in the evaluation
of bids; and







The rules that shall apply if a bidder fails to furnish the literature before
bid opening or the literature furnished does not comply with the requirements of
the IFB.







After receipt of bids, the contracting officer may waive the requirement for
furnishing descriptive literature if either of the following occurs:



(a)  	The bidder states in its bid that the product being offered is the same as
a  product previously or currently being furnished to the District; or







	The contracting officer determines that the product offered by the bidder
complies in all material respects with the specification requirements of the
