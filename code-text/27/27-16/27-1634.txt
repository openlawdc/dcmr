NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE HIGHEST RANKED OFFEROR (§ 27-1634)

1634.1. Pursuant to § 1632.1(b) or § 1632.1(d), the contracting officer may
   elect to proceed with negotiations with the highest-ranked offeror on price or
   technical matters within the scope of the RFP.

   1634.2. During negotiations the contracting officer shall do the following:
   
   
   
   	(a)	Control all negotiations;
   
   
   
   	(b) 	Advise the offeror of deficiencies in its proposal so that the offeror
   is 			given an opportunity to satisfy the District&#8217;s requirements;
   
   
   
   	(c)	Attempt to resolve any uncertainties concerning the technical proposal
   and 		other terms and conditions of the proposal;
   
   
   
   	(d)	Resolve any suspected mistakes by calling them to the offeror&#8217;s
   attention 			as specifically as possible; and
   
   
   
   	(e)	Provide the offeror a reasonable opportunity to submit any cost or price,
   			technical, or other revisions to its proposal that may result from the
   			negotiations.

   1634.3. If a satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated with the
   highest-ranked offeror, the contracting officer may enter negotiations on
   price or technical matters within the scope of the RFP,  as provided under
   §§ 1634.2 and 1634.3, with the lower-ranked offerors in order of ranking
   until a satisfactory contract can be awarded.

   1634.4. If a contract cannot be negotiated, the contracting officer may reopen
   negotiations with any offeror with whom negotiations were terminated.

   1634.5. If the contracting officer makes changes to the general scope of the
   RFP after negotiations, the contracting officer shall issue a request for best
   and final offers to all of the offerors which submitted proposals to the RFP.

   1634.6. After evaluation of the best and final offers under §1634.5, the
   contracting officer shall award to the highest-ranked offeror whose best and
   final offer is most advantageous to the District, considering only price and
   other factors included in the solicitation.  The contracting officer may
   negotiate further with the highest-ranked offeror prior to award, provided
   that the terms of the contract are within the scope of the RFP.
