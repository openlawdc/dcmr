DISCLOSURE OF MISTAKES BEFORE AWARD (ยง 27-1631)

1631.1. The contracting officer shall examine all proposals before award for

   mistakes or irregularities shall be only for clarification, not discussion.

   the contracting is proceeding under ยง 1632.1(c), the contracting officer
   shall not make award without discussions with all offerors within the
   competitive range.
