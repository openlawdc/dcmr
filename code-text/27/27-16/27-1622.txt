                                  DC REGULATIONS

CHANGES IN DISTRICT REQUIREMENTS (ยง 27-1622)

1622.1. When, either before or after receipt of proposals, the District
   increases, decreases 	or otherwise changes its requirements, the contracting
   officer shall issue a written 	amendment to the solicitation in accordance
   with ยง 1623.
   
   
   
   1622.2  		In deciding which firms to notify of a change, the contracting
   officer shall 	consider the state in the procurement cycle at which the change
   occurs and the 	magnitude of the change, as follows:
   
   
   
   	(a)	If proposals are not yet due, the amendment shall be published in the
   same 		manner as the solicitation;
   
   
   
   	(b) 	If the time for receipt of proposals has passed but proposals have not
   yet 			been evaluated, the amendment shall be sent only to the responding
   			offerors; and
   
   
   
   	(c) 	If a competitive range has been established, the amendment shall be sent
   			only to those offerors within the competitive range.

   1622.3. If a change is so substantial that it warrants complete revision of a
   solicitation, the 	contracting officer shall cancel the original solicitation
   and issue a new one, 	regardless of the state of the procurement. The new
   solicitation shall be advertised 	in accordance with the requirements of
   Chapter 13 of this title.

   1622.4. If the proposal considered to be most advantageous to the District (as
   determined 	by using the established evaluation criteria and selection
   procedure) involves a 	departure from the stated requirements, the contracting
   officer shall provide all 	offerors an opportunity to submit new or amended
   proposals on the basis of the 	revised requirements, if this can be done
   without revealing to the other offerors 	the solution proposed in the original
   departure or any other information that is 	entitled to protection.
