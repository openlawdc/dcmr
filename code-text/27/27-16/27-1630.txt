                                  DC REGULATIONS

PROPOSAL EVALUATION (ยง 27-1630)

1630.1. The contacting officer shall evaluate each proposal using only the
   evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and in accordance with the weightings
   provided in the RFP.

   1630.2. The contracting officer shall evaluate the cost estimate or price, not
   only to determine whether it is reasonable, but also to determine the
   offeror&#8217;s understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract.

   1630.3. If any technical evaluation is necessary beyond ensuring that the
   proposal meets the minimum requirements in the solicitation, the contracting
   officer shall forward the proposals to the appropriate technical official for
   technical evaluation.

   1630.4. If a technical evaluation is done, a technical evaluation report shall
   be prepared by the technical official and shall contain the following:
   
   
   
   	(a)	The basis for evaluation;
   
   
   
   	(b)	An analysis of the technically acceptable and unacceptable proposals,
   	including an assessment of each offeror&#8217;s ability to accomplish the
   	technical requirements;
   
   
   
   	(c)	A summary, matrix, or quantitative ranking of each technical proposal in
   	relation to the best rating possible; and
   
   
   
   	(d)	A summary of findings.

   1630.5. When evaluating a cost-reimbursement contract, the cost proposal shall
   not be controlling.  The contracting officer shall consider which offeror can
   perform the contract in a manner most advantageous to the District as
   determined by evaluation of proposals according to the established evaluation
   criteria.

   1630.6. The contracting officer may reject all proposals received in response
   to a solicitation by a written determination that to do so would be in the
   best interest of the District.  The contracting officer&#8217;s determination
   shall be approved by the Director.

   1630.7. The reasons given for rejection may include, but are not limited to,
   the following:
   
   
   
   	(a)	All otherwise acceptable proposals received are at unreasonable prices;
   or
   
   
   
   	(b)	The proposals were not independently arrived at in open competition,
   	were collusive or were submitted in bad faith.

   1630.8. When all proposals are rejected and no award will be made as a result
   of the RFP, the contracting officer shall cancel the RFP.

   1630.9. The contracting officer shall prepare supporting documentation for the
   selection 	decision that shows the relative differences among the proposals
   and their 	strengths, weaknesses, and risks in terms of the evaluation
   factors. The 	supporting documentation shall include the basis for the
   selection.
