                                  DC REGULATIONS

REOPENING AND RECONSIDERATION (§ 27-827)

827.1 		An applicant or respondent may file a motion for reconsideration with
the Commission, based on new evidence, misapplication of law, or misstatement of
a material fact within ten (10) days after the date on which the applicant or
respondent was served with the Commission&#8217;s decision.



827.2 		The motion for reconsideration shall be in writing and shall state the
following:

		(a) 	The matters of record alleged to have been erroneously decided;

		(b) 	The grounds relied upon; and

		(c) 	The relief sought.



827.3 		If a motion under this section is based wholly or partially on new
evidence, the new evidence or arguments shall be set forth in an affidavit which
verifies that the petitioner could not with due diligence have become aware of
the new evidence prior to the Commission hearing.



827.4 		The government may file a response to a motion to reconsider and the
Commission may decide a motion to reconsider without a hearing.



827.5 		The Commission may reopen a hearing where an applicant or respondent has
failed to appear at a scheduled hearing, provided that the applicant or
respondent submits a motion in writing setting forth good cause for the
applicant’s or respondent&#8217;s failure to appear.  The failure to report a
change of address pursuant to this chapter does not constitute good cause.



827.6 		A motion to reopen a hearing shall be filed within ten (10) days of the
date of the hearing.



827.7 		Neither the submission nor the granting of a motion under this section
shall operate as a stay of a decision unless so ordered by the Commission.



827.8 		The failure of the Commission to issue an order in response to a motion
under this section within thirty (30) days of the submission of the motion shall
constitute a denial of the motion.
