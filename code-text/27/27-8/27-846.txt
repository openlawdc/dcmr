DEPARTMENT ASSISTANCE FOR COVERED PROJECTS (ยง 27-846)

846.1. If a District agency receives no response to develop a Covered Project
   from a Qualified Responder, it may contact the Director for further
   assistance.  The Director may:
   
   
   
   (a)	Assist the District agency to restructure the Covered Project to increase 
   the likelihood of finding Qualified Responders (for example, determining
   whether the Covered Project could be separated into components such that one
   or more portions could be developed by a Development Participant as a
   Component Developer);
   
   
   
   (b)	Assist the District agency and its respondents who were not Qualified
   Respondents in identifying qualified Equity Participants and Development
   Participants; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Evaluate a request by the District agency for a modification of some or
   all of the EDP Program requirements.
