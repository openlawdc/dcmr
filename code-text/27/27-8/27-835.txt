   (c)	Changes in the business operation or certification of the subcontractor;
   
   
   
   (d) 	Changes in economic conditions from the time the plan was developed; and
   
   
   
   (e)	 The extent of the breach.

   835.2. Notwithstanding § 835.2, failure to achieve at least ninety percent

   835.3 		Contracting officers seeking a waiver or modification of the
   subcontracting requirements of sections 2346 and 2350 of the Act shall submit
