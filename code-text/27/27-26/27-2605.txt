                                  DC REGULATIONS

PRICING CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS (ยง 27-2605)

2605.1. Unless otherwise authorized under this chapter, a contracting officer
   shall use firm-fixed-price contracts to procure construction.

   2605.2. A contract may be priced on a lump-sum basis (when a lump sum is paid
   for the total work or defined parts of the work), on a unit-price basis (when
   a unit price is paid for a specified quantity of work units), or a combination
   of both methods.

   2605.3. The contracting officer shall use lump-sum pricing in preference to
   unit pricing except when any one (1) of the following circumstances exists:
   
   
   
   (a)	Large quantities of work (such as excavation, grading, paving, building
   outside utilities, or site preparation) are involved which cannot be estimated
   with sufficient confidence to permit a lump-sum offer without a substantial
   contingency;
   
   
   
   (b)	Estimated quantities of work required may change significantly during
   construction; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Bidders would have to expend unusual effort to develop adequate estimates.

   2605.4. If an economic price adjustment provision is customary in contracts
   for the type of work being procured, or when omission of an adjustment
   provision would preclude a significant number of firms from submitting bids or
   would result in bidders including unwarranted contingencies in proposed
   prices, fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustments may be used in
   accordance with the applicable provisions of chapters 15 and 24 of this title.
