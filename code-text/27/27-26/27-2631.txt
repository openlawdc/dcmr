                                  DC REGULATIONS

DESIGN WITHIN FUNDING LIMITATIONS (ยง 27-2631)

2631.1. The District may require the architect-engineer contractor to design
   the project so that construction costs will not exceed a contractually
   specified dollar limit. The amount of the construction funding limitation
   shall be established during negotiations between the firm and the contracting
   officer.

   2631.2. In negotiating the funding limitation amount, the contracting officer
   shall make available to the firm the information upon which the District has
   based its initial construction estimate and subsequently acquired information
   that may affect the construction costs.

   2631.3. If the price of construction proposed in response to a District
   solicitation exceeds the construction specified dollar funding limit in the
   architect-engineer contract, the firm shall be solely responsible for
   redesigning the project within the funding limitation.

   2631.4. Any redesign services required by ยง2631.3 shall be performed at no
   increase in the price of the architect-engineer contract. However, if the cost
   of proposed construction is affected by events beyond the firm&#8217;s
   reasonable control (such as an increase in material cost which could not have
   been anticipated or an undue delay by the District in issuing a construction
   solicitation), the District may be obligated for any additional costs.

   2631.5. If an architect-engineer firm&#8217;s design fails to meet the
   contractual limitation on construction cost and the District determines that
   the firm should not redesign the project, the contracting officer shall place
   a written statement of the reasons for that determination in the contract
   file.
