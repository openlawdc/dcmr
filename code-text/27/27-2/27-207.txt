                                  DC REGULATIONS

AMENDMENT OF PLEADINGS (ยง 27-207)

207.1. The Board may, in its discretion, and within the proper scope of the
   appeal, permit either party to amend its pleading upon conditions fair to both
   parties.

   207.2. When issues within the proper scope of the appeal have not been raised
   by the pleadings but are tried by express or implied consent of the parties or
   by permission of the Board, they shall be treated in all respects as if they
   had been raised in the pleadings. In these instances, motions to amend the
   pleadings to conform to the proof may be made but are not required. If
   evidence is objected to at a hearing on the ground that it is not within the
   issues raised by the pleadings, it may be admitted within the proper scope of
   the appeal, provided, however, that the objecting party may be granted a
   continuance if necessary to enable it to meet the evidence.
