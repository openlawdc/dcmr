                                  DC REGULATIONS

REPURCHASE AGAINST CONTRACTOR&#8217;S ACCOUNT (§ 27-3716)

3716.1. When the goods or services under a terminated contract are still
   required after termination for default, the contracting officer shall
   repurchase the same or similar goods or services against the
   contractor&#8217;s account as soon as practicable.

   3716.2. The contracting officer shall repurchase similar goods and services at
   as reasonable a price as practicable, considering the quality and delivery
   requirements.

   3716.3. The contracting officer may repurchase a quantity in excess of the
   quantity terminated for default when the excess quantity is needed. However,
   the costs of any items in excess of the undelivered quantity terminated for
   default shall not be charged against the defaulting contractor.

   3716.4. Except as provided in §§3716.5 and 3717, the contracting officer
   shall use the procedures set forth in chapter 15 or chapter 16 of this title,
   whichever is applicable, to repurchase the terminated goods or services, or
   any additional requirements needed.

   3716.5. Except as provided in §3717, if the goods or services are required
   immediately, the contracting officer may reprocure the required goods or the
   services on an emergency basis in accordance with the provisions of chapter 17
   of this title. The period of performance for any services reprocured shall not
   exceed the limits specified in chapter 17 of this title.

   3716.6. If repurchase is made at a price greater than the price of the goods
   or services terminated, the contracting officer shall, after completion and
   final payment of the repurchase contract, make a written demand on the
   contractor for the total amount of the excess, giving consideration to any
   increases or decreases in other costs, such as transportation or discounts.
