   default.

   3712.2. The show cause notice shall give the contractor ten (10) days after
   receipt of the notice to present in writing any facts bearing on the case. The
   notice shall be hand delivered or sent by certified mail, return receipt
   requested.

   3712.3. The notice may further state that failure of the contractor to present
   an explanation may be taken as an admission that no valid explanation exists.
   When appropriate, the notice may invite the contractor to discuss the matter
   at a conference.

   under ยง3711.3.
