                                  DC REGULATIONS

SETTLEMENT BY DETERMINATION (ยง 27-3705)

3705.1. If the contractor and the contracting officer cannot agree on a
   termination settlement under ยง3703, or if the contractor fails to submit a
   settlement proposal within the period required by the termination clause, the
   contracting officer shall issue a determination of the amount due consistent
   with the termination clause.

   3705.2. If the contractor submits a settlement proposal, the contracting
   officer shall give the contractor notice, either by hand delivery or certified
   mail, return receipt requested, that the contractor may submit evidence
   substantiating the settlement amount in its proposal. The notice shall state a
   date certain by which the evidence must be received by the contracting
   officer.

   3705.3. After reviewing any evidence submitted by the contractor and other
   available information, the contracting officer shall determine the amount due
   and shall transmit a copy of the determination to the contractor by certified
   mail, return receipt requested, or by any other method that provides evidence
   of receipt.

   3705.4. The determination letter shall advise the contractor that the
   determination is a final decision from which the contractor may appeal under
   the procedures set forth in the Act, chapter 38 of this title, and the
   disputes clause in the contract, except as specified in ยง3705.6. The
   determination shall specify the amount due to the contractor and shall explain
   each major item that was not allowed.

   3705.5. The contracting officer shall retain all written evidence and other
   data relied upon in making a determination.

   3705.6. The contractor may appeal any settlement by determination under the
   provisions of the Act, chapter 38 of this title, and the disputes clause in
   the contract, except when the contractor has failed to submit a settlement
   proposal within the time provided in the contract and has failed to request an
   extension of time. The filing of an appeal shall not affect the authority of
   the contracting officer to enter into a settlement agreement, in whole or in
   part, by negotiation with the contractor at any time before the appeal is
   decided.
