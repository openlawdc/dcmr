SETTLEMENT PROPOSALS AND SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS (ยง 27-3708)

3708.1. The contractor shall submit to the contracting officer a settlement
   proposal for the amount claimed because of the termination for convenience.

   3708.2. The contractor shall submit the settlement proposal within one (1)
   year from the effective date of the termination, unless the period is extended
   by the contracting officer.

   3708.3. The settlement proposal shall cover all cost elements, including
   settlements with subcontractors and any proposed profit, and shall include
   reasonable detail supported by accounting data satisfactory to the contracting
   officer.

   3708.4. For cost-reimbursement contracts, the termination clauses approved by
   the Director shall provide for settlement of costs and fees, if any. The
   contract clauses governing costs shall determine what costs are allowable.

   3708.5. The settlement agreement may include all demands of the District and
   proposals of the contractor under the terminated contract. However, no amount
   shall be allowed for any item of cost disallowed by the contracting officer.

   3708.6. If the contracting officer and contractor agree on an overall
   settlement of costs, agreement on each element of cost shall not be required.
   When appropriate, the contracting officer may compromise differences and
   settle doubtful costs by agreement. However, an overall settlement shall not
   include costs that are clearly not allowable under the terms of the contract.
