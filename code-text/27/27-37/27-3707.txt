   3707.3. The failure of a prime contractor to include an appropriate
   termination clause in any subcontract or the failure of the contractor to
   exercise the rights of the termination clause shall not affect the
   District&#8217;s right to require the termination of the subcontract, and
   shall not increase the obligation of the District in any way whatsoever.

   3707.4. In no event shall the District be required to pay the prime contractor
