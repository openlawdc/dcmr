                                  DC REGULATIONS

SURETY TAKEOVER AGREEMENTS (§ 27-3717)

3717.1. The contracting officer shall carefully consider proposals by the
   surety concerning completion of the work. The contracting officer shall take
   action on the basis of the District&#8217;s interests, including the possible
   effect of the action upon the District&#8217;s rights against the surety.

   3717.2. If the surety offers to complete the contract work, the contracting
   officer shall accept the offer unless the contracting officer has reason to
   believe that the persons or firms proposed by the surety to complete the work
   are not competent or qualified and the interests of the District would be
   substantially prejudiced.

   3717.3. If the surety conditions its offer of completion upon the execution by
   the District of a &#8220;takeover&#8221; agreement fixing the surety&#8217;s
   rights to payment from unpaid prior earnings (retained percentage and unpaid
   progress estimates), the contracting officer may, at any time after the
   effective date of the termination, enter into a written agreement with the
   surety.

   3717.4. The takeover agreement shall provide for the surety to complete the
   work according to all the terms and conditions of the contract and for the
   District to pay the surety the balance of the contract price, less any setoffs
   or assessed damages, but not in excess of the surety&#8217;s costs and
   expenses, in the manner provided by the contract subject to the following
   conditions set forth in §§3717.5 through 3717.8.

   3717.5. Under a takeover agreement, any unpaid earnings of the defaulting
   contractor, including retained percentages and progress estimates for work
   accomplished before termination, shall be subject to debts and assessed
   damages due the District by the contractor.

   3717.6. The takeover agreement shall not waive or release the District&#8217;s
   right to liquidated damages for delays in completion of the work, except to
   the extent that they are excusable under the contract.

   3717.7. If the contract proceeds have been assigned to a financing
   institution, the surety may not be paid from unpaid earnings under a takeover
   agreement, unless the assignee consents to the payment in writing.

   3717.8. Under a takeover agreement, the surety shall not be paid any amount in
   excess of its total expenditures necessarily made in completing the work and
   discharging its liabilities under the payment bond of the defaulting
   contractor.

   3717.9. The contracting officer shall make payments to the surety to reimburse
   it for discharging its liabilities under the payment bond of the defaulting
   contractor only on the basis of one (1) of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Mutual agreement between the District, the defaulting contractor, and the
   surety; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
