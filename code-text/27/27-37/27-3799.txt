   the meanings ascribed:
   
   
   
   Completed goods &#8211; goods that are completely manufactured and ready for
   delivery.
   
   
   
   Cure notice &#8211; a notice in writing in which the contracting officer
   specifies a contractor&#8217;s failure to perform some provision of the
   contract or failure to make sufficient progress on contract performance so as
   to endanger performance of the contract. The notice includes a period of time
   in which the contractor will be allowed to cure the failure.
   
   
   
   Director &#8211; the Director of the Office of Contracting and Procurement or
   the District of Columbia Chief Procurement Officer.
   
   
   
   District property account &#8211; an accounting of property owned by the
   District.
   
   
   
   Effective date of termination &#8211; the date on which the notice of
   termination requires the contractor to stop performance under the contract. If
   the termination notice is received by the contractor subsequent to the date
   fixed for termination, then the effective date of termination is the date the
   notice is received by the contractor.
   
   
   
   Other work &#8211; any current or scheduled work of the contractor, whether
   governmental or commercial, other than work related to the terminated
   contract.
   
   
   
   Partial termination &#8211; the termination of a part, but not all, of the
   work that has not been completed and accepted under a contract.
   
   
   
   Settlement agreement &#8211; a written agreement in the form of a modification
   to a contract settling all or a severable portion of a settlement proposal.
   
   
   
   Settlement proposal &#8211; a proposal for effecting settlement of a contract
   terminated, in whole or in part, submitted by a contractor or subcontractor.
   
   
   
   Show cause notice &#8211; a notice in which the contracting officer notifies
   the contractor in writing of the possibility of a termination for default. The
   notice calls the contractor&#8217;s attention to the contractual liabilities
   if the contract is terminated for default, and requests the contractor to show
   cause why the contract should not be terminated for default.
   
   
   
   Terminated portion of the contract &#8211; the portion of a terminated
   contract that relates to work or end items not completed and accepted before
   the effective date of termination, and is the portion of the contract which
   the contractor is not to continue to perform. For construction contracts that
   have been completely terminated for convenience, it means the entire contract,
   notwithstanding the completion of or payment for individual items of work
   before termination.
   
   
   
   Termination for default &#8211; the exercise of the District&#8217;s
   contractual right to terminate, completely or partially, a contract because of
   the contractor&#8217;s actual or anticipated failure to perform its
   contractual obligations.
