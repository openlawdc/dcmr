                                  DC REGULATIONS

DEFERMENT OF COLLECTION (§ 27-3234)

3234.1. If the contracting officer receives a written request from the
   contractor for a deferment of the debt collection or installment payments, the
   contracting officer shall promptly review the request to see if the
   information included in accordance with §3234.2 is adequate for action on the
   request.

   3234.2. With each request for deferment of collection, the contractor shall
   submit the following information about the contractor:
   
   
   
   (a)	Financial condition;
   
   
   
   (b)	Contract backlog;
   
   
   
   (c)	Projected cash receipts and requirements;
   
   
   
   (d)	The feasibility of immediate payment of the debt; and
   
   
   
   (e)	The probable effect on the contractor of immediate payment in full.

   3234.3. The contracting officer may agree to payment of the contract debt in
   installments if the amount of the debt and other issues are resolved by
   negotiation in accordance with §3232.

   3234.4. The contracting officer may authorize a deferment of debt collection,
   in accordance with this section, pending the resolution of appeals filed by
   the contractor under the provisions of chapter 38 of this title and §§3230
   through 3233 of this chapter.

   3234.5. The contracting officer may grant deferments pending disposition of
   appeal to financially weak contractors if there would be undue hardship on the
   contractor, and the District would be reasonably secure against loss.

   3234.6. If a contractor has not appealed the debt or filed an appeal under
   §§904 or 905 of the Act, D.C. Official Code §§2-309.04 or 2-309.05,
   (2001), the contracting officer may arrange for deferred payments if the
   contractor is unable to pay at once in full or would be seriously impaired.

   3234.7. If a contractor has appealed the debt or filed an appeal under §§904
   or 905 of the Act, D.C. Official Code §§2-309.04 or 2-309.05 (2001), debt
   collection shall not be suspended or delayed. Until the appeal is decided,
   deferments shall only be granted if, within thirty (30) days after the filing,
   the contractor presents to the contracting officer a good and sufficient bond,
   or other collateral acceptable to the contracting officer, in the amount of
   the claim.

   3234.8. Deferred payment arrangements shall be made in accordance with §3235.
