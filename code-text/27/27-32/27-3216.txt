CONSIDERATION FOR PROGRESS PAYMENTS (ยง 27-3216)

3216.1. There shall be no requirement for a separate consideration for
   providing progress payments or for changing progress payment or liquidation
   rates, if coverage is included in the terms of the contract when awarded.

   3216.2. Adequate new consideration shall be required when the contract, during
   contract performance, is amended to provide progress payments.

   3216.3. When adequate new consideration is required pursuant to ยง3216.2, the
   contractor may provide new consideration by monetary means (such as reduction
   in contract price) or nonmonetary means (such as incorporating terms in the
   contract amendment conferring a new benefit on the District).

   3216.4. Fair and reasonable consideration shall approximate the amount by
   which the price would have been smaller if the provision for progress payments
   had been included in the initial contract.
