SUSPENSION OR REDUCTION OF PROGRESS PAYMENTS (ยง 27-3219)

3219.1. In each contract that provides for progress payments, the contracting
   officer shall include provisions, approved by the Director, which assert the
   District&#8217;s right to reduce or suspend progress payments, or increase the
   liquidation rate, as appropriate, in the following circumstances:
   
   
   
   (a)	If the contractor fails to maintain an efficient and reliable accounting
   system and controls that are adequate for the proper administration of
   progress payments;
   
   
   
   (b)	If the contracting officer determines that contract performance, including
   full liquidation of progress payments, is endangered by the contractor&#8217;s
   financial condition or by a failure to make progress on the performance of the
   contract;
   
   
   
   (c)	If the inventory allocated to the contract exceeds reasonable
   requirements;
   
   
   
   (d)	If the contractor is delinquent in paying the costs of contract
   performance in the ordinary course of business;
   
   
   
   (e)	If the unliquidated progress payments exceed the fair value of undelivered
   work under the contract; and
   
   
   
   (f)	If the sum of the total costs incurred under a contract, plus the
   estimated costs to complete performance, are likely to exceed the contract
   price.

   3219.2. Actions under this section shall only be taken in accordance with the
   contract terms and only after the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The contracting officer gives notice to the contractor of the intended
   action and provides an opportunity for discussion; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The contracting officer evaluates the effect of the action on the
   contractor&#8217;s operations, based on the contractor&#8217;s financial
   condition, projected cash requirements, and the existing or available credit
   arrangements.

   3219.3. The contracting officer shall take immediate unilateral action only if
   warranted by circumstances such as overpayments or unsatisfactory contract
   performance.

   3219.4. In all cases, the contracting officer shall document the contract file
   with evidence supporting the contracting officer&#8217;s decisions.
