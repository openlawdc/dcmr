                                  DC REGULATIONS

SUPERVISION OF PROGRESS PAYMENTS (ยง 27-3217)

3217.1. The extent of progress payments supervision, by prepayment review or
   periodic review, may vary, according to the contractor&#8217;s experience,
   performance record, reliability, quality of management, and financial
   strength, and with the adequacy of the contractor&#8217;s accounting systems
   and controls.

   3217.2. Supervision shall be of a kind and degree sufficient to provide timely
   knowledge of the need for, and timely opportunity for, any actions necessary
   to protect the interests of the District.

   3217.3. So far as is practicable, all problems relating to costs that are
   likely to create disagreements in future administration of the contract shall
   be identified and resolved at the inception of the contract, in accordance
   with the provisions of chapter 33 of this title.

   3217.4. The contracting officer shall, before approving progress payments,
   determine the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	That the contractor will be capable of liquidating any progress payments,
   or that the District is otherwise protected against loss by additional
   protective provisions in the contract; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The contractor&#8217;s accounting system and controls are adequate for
   proper administration of progress payments.

   3217.5. When the reliability of the contractor and the adequacy of the
   contractor&#8217;s accounting system has been established pursuant to
   ยง3217.4, the contracting officer may approve progress payment requests.

   3217.6. The contracting officer may request an audit review of the
   contractor&#8217;s request for progress payment when there is reason to
   question the reliability or accuracy of the contractor&#8217;s certification,
   or if the contracting officer believes that the contract will involve a loss.

   3217.7. Progress payments made under a requirements contract or an indefinite
   quantity contract shall be administered under each individual order as if the
   order constituted a separate contract. The contracting officer may treat a
   group of orders as a single unit for administration of progress payments if
   each order is subject to the same liquidation rate.

   3217.8. The contracting officer shall ensure that any excess of unliquidated
   progress payments over the amount permitted by the liquidated rate specified
   in the contract is promptly corrected through one (1) or more of the
   following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Increasing the liquidation rate;
   
   
   
   (b)	Reducing the progress payment rate; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Suspending progress payments.
