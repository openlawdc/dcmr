   of the contracting officer, including reviews or audits to determine the
   following:

   value of work accomplished on the undelivered portion of the contract;
   
   
   
   (b)	Whether the limitation on progress payments has been exceeded;
   
   
   
   (c)	Whether the unpaid balance of the contract price will be adequate to cover
   the anticipated cost of completion, or the contractor has adequate resources
   to complete the contract; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Whether there is any reason to doubt the adequacy or reliability of the
   contractor&#8217;s accounting system, controls, or payment certification.

   periodically, at intervals of six (6) months or less, and may conduct reviews
