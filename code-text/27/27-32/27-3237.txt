COMPROMISE OF CONTRACT DEBT COLLECTIONS (ยง 27-3237)

3237.1. For debts under ten thousand dollars ($10,000), excluding interest, if
   further collection is not practical or would cost more than the amount of
   recovery, the Director may compromise the debt or terminate or suspend further
   collection action.

   3237.2. The Director shall not compromise any debt involving fraud. However,
   the Director may suspend collection action under this section, regardless of
   fraud, if the Attorney General determines that the cost of collection would
   exceed the amount of recovery.
