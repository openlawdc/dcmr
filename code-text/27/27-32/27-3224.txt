PROGRESS PAYMENTS TO SUBCONTRACTORS (§ 27-3224)

3224.1. The contracting officer shall encourage each contractor to provide
   progress payments to subcontractors on terms that meet the standards in §3215
   for customary progress payments.

   3224.2. In each contract providing for progress payments, the contracting
   officer shall include a provision, approved by the Director, which requires
   the contractor to include in the terms of each subcontract the substance of
   the progress payment provisions in the prime contract, modified to indicate
   that the contractor (not the District) awards the subcontract and administers
   the progress payments.

   3224.3. If the contractor makes progress payments to a subcontractor under a
   cost-reimbursement prime contract, the contracting officer shall accept the
   progress payments as reimbursable costs of the prime contract only under the
   following conditions:
   
   
   
   (a)	When the payments are made under the standards in §3215 for customary
   progress payments;
   
   
   
   (b)	When the payments do not exceed the progress payment rate set forth in
   §3215;
   
   
   
   (c)	When the subcontractor complies with the liquidation principles set forth
   in §3220; and
   
   
   
   (d)	When the subcontract contains progress payments terms as required under
   §3224.2.
