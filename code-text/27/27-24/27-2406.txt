                                  DC REGULATIONS

INCENTIVE CONTRACTS (§ 27-2406)

2406.1. The contracting officer may use an incentive contract when a
   firm-fixed-price contract is not appropriate and the required goods or
   services can be procured at lower costs and, in certain instances, with
   improved delivery or technical performance, by relating the amount of profit
   or fee payable under the contract to the contractor&#8217;s performance.

   2406.2. The contracting officer may use an incentive contract when it is
   necessary to establish reasonable and attainable targets that are clearly
   understandable by the contractor, and to provide appropriate incentive
   arrangements designed to motivate contractor efforts and discourage contractor
   inefficiency and waste.

   2406.3. When predetermined formula-type incentives on technical performance or
   delivery are included, increases in profit or fee shall be provided only for
   achievement that surpasses the targets, and decreases shall be provided for to
   the extent that targets are not met.

   2406.4. The contracting officer shall apply incentive increases or decreases
   to performance targets rather than minimum performance requirements.

   2406.5. Incentive contracts may be fixed-price incentive contracts or
   cost-reimbursement incentive contracts.

   2406.6. Cost-reimbursement incentive contracts shall be subject to the
   provisions of §§2405.1, 2405.2, and 2405.3.
