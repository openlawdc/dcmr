COST-PLUS-AWARD-FEE CONTRACTS (ยง 27-2409)

2409.1. A cost-plus-award-fee contract may be used when the following factors
   apply:
   
   
   
   (a)	The work to be performed is such that it is neither feasible nor effective
   to devise predetermined objective incentive targets applicable to cost,
   technical performance, or schedule;
   
   
   
   (b)	The likelihood of meeting the procurement objective will be enhanced by
   using a contract that effectively motivates the contractor toward exceptional
   performance and provides the District with the flexibility to evaluate both
   actual performance and the conditions under which it was achieved; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Any additional administrative effort and cost required to monitor and
   evaluate performance are justified by the expected benefits.

   2409.2. A cost-plus-award-fee contract shall provide for a fee consisting of a
   base amount fixed at inception of the contract and an award amount that the
   contractor may earn in whole or in part during performance. Each contract
   shall state a maximum award amount that may be paid under the contract.

   2409.3. The amount of the award fee to be paid shall be determined by the
   contracting officer&#8217;s judgmental evaluation of the contractor&#8217;s
   performance in terms of the criteria stated in the contract.

   2409.4. The award fee determination shall be made unilaterally by the
   contracting officer and shall not be subject to appeal or the
   contractor&#8217;s rights under the disputes clause in the contract.

   2409.5. A cost-plus-award-fee contract shall provide for evaluation at stated
   intervals during performance, so that the contractor will periodically be
   informed of the quality of its performance and the area in which improvement
   is expected.
