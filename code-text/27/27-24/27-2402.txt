                                  DC REGULATIONS

FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS (ยง 27-2402)

2402.1. Fixed-price contracts may provide for a firm price or, in appropriate
   cases, an adjustable price.

   2402.2. Fixed-price contracts providing for an adjustable price may include a
   ceiling price, a target price (including target cost), or both. Unless
   otherwise specified in the contract, the ceiling price or target price shall
   be subject to adjustment only by operation of contract clauses, approved by
   the Director, providing for equitable adjustment or other revision of the
   contract price under stated circumstances.

   2402.3. A firm-fixed-price contract shall provide for a price that is not
   subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor&#8217;s cost
   experience in performing the contract.

   2402.4. A firm-fixed-price contract shall be used for acquiring commercial
   products or commercial-type products, or for acquiring other goods or
   services, on the basis of reasonably definite functional or detailed
   specifications if the contracting officer can establish fair and reasonable
   prices at the outset, including the following circumstances:
   
   
   
   (a)	When there is adequate price competition;
   
   
   
   (b)	When there are reasonable price comparisons with prior purchases of the
   same or similar goods or services made on a competitive basis;
   
   
   
   (c)	When available cost or pricing information permits realistic estimates of
   the probable costs of performance; and
   
   
   
   (d)	When performance uncertainties can be identified and reasonable estimates
   of their cost impact can be made, and the contractor is willing to accept a
   firm-fixed-price contract.
