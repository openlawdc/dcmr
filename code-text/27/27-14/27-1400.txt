GENERAL PROVISIONS (§ 27-1400)

The District shall accomplish the purposes of this title by using electronic
commerce whenever practicable.







	The use of the terms in this title commonly associated with paper transactions
(for example, “typewritten”, “copy”, “document”, “signed in
ink”, “written legibly”, “page”, “postmark”, “envelope”) shall
be deemed to include their electronic analogues and shall not be interpreted to
discourage the use of electronic commerce.







	As a condition of participation in an electronic transaction, the Director may
require potential bidders and offerors to:



(a)	Register with the District, and any other entity designated by the District,
before participating in an electronic transaction; and



(b)	Agree to the terms, conditions, or other requirements of an electronic
transaction, or to agree to terms and conditions governing the electronic
transaction, such as procedures that the District may use to attribute,
authenticate, or verify the accuracy of an electronic offer or the actions that
constitute an electronic signature.







	Contracting officers may allow the use of other media, including but not
limited to hard copies of drawings, specifications, or bid samples, to
supplement electronic submissions to meet the requirements of the electronic
transaction.
