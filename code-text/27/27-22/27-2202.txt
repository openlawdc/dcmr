                                  DC REGULATIONS

APPLICATION OF GENERAL STANDARDS (§ 27-2202)

2202.1. As prescribed in chapter 43 of this title, the contracting officer
   shall investigate and determine whether the contractor is eligible to receive
   an award under the Walsh- Healey Act, 41 U.S.C. §§35-45, and shall not rely
   on the contractor&#8217;s representation, if either of the following apply:
   
   (a)	A protest of eligibility has been lodged in accordance with federal law
   and regulations; or
   
   
   
   (b)	The contracting officer has reason to doubt the validity of the
   representation.

   2202.2. Except to the extent that a prospective contractor has sufficient
   resources, the contracting officer shall require, and the prospective
   contractor shall promptly provide, acceptable evidence of the prospective
   contractor&#8217;s ability to obtain resources.

   2202.3. Acceptable evidence of the prospective contractor&#8217;s ability to
   obtain resources, as specified in §2200.4, shall consist of a commitment or
   explicit arrangement that will be in existence prior to the time of contract
   award to rent, purchase, or otherwise acquire the needed facilities,
   equipment, personnel, or other resources.

   2202.4. A prospective contractor that is or recently has been seriously
   deficient in contract performance shall be presumed to be nonresponsible. The
   contracting officer may determine the contractor to be responsible if the
   circumstances of the prior deficiency were properly beyond the
   contractor&#8217;s control or if the contractor has taken appropriate
   corrective action.

   2202.5. An affiliated business shall be considered a separate entity in
   determining whether the business that is to perform the contract meets the
   applicable standards of responsibility. However, the contracting officer shall
   consider an affiliate&#8217;s past performance and integrity when they may
   adversely affect the prospective contractor&#8217;s responsibility.

   2202.6. If a bid or offer of a certified minority business that would
   otherwise be accepted is to be rejected because of a determination of
   nonresponsibility, the contracting officer shall refer the matter to the
   Department of Small and Local Business Development (“DSLDB”). Within ten
   (10) working days, the DS:DB shall provide any evidence it deems appropriate
   relevant to the responsibility of the certified minority business. The
   contracting officer shall consider any evidence provided by the DSLDB in
   deciding whether to issue a determination of nonresponsibility pursuant to
   §2205.2.
