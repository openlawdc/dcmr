2219.1. Each contractor’s performance shall be evaluated and graded after
   expiration or termination of each contract.

   2219.2. A contractor may receive one (1) of the following performance grades
   in a final evaluation letter:
   
   
   
   (a)	A (Excellent), which shall have a numeric value of four-point-zero (4.0);

   (c)	F (Unsatisfactory), which shall have a numeric value of zero (0).

   2219.3. If a contractor receives a final grade of F on a contract, the
   Director shall determine a cumulative grade by averaging all of the grades
   that the contractor has received on the performance of its contracts for the
   preceding twelve (12) month period. If the average grade for the preceding
   twelve (12) month period equals one-point-nine (1.9) or below, that cumulative
   grade shall be considered a grade of F, and the Director shall initiate
   debarment proceedings against the contractor.

   2219.4. The Director shall initiate debarment proceedings against a contractor
   by notifying the contractor by certified mail, return receipt requested, of

   (b)	The contractor may, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the notice,
   file a written appeal of the cumulative grade to the Director;
   
   
   
   (c)	If the contractor files a written appeal, the Director will review the
   cumulative grade and make a final written decision on the contractor’s
   cumulative grade;
   
   
   
   (d)	In making its appeal, the contractor may submit in person, in writing, or
   through a representative, information and argument in opposition to the
   proposed cumulative grade of F, including any additional specific information
   that raises a genuine issue of fact; and
   
   
   
   (e)  	If the contractor fails to file a written appeal within fifteen (15)
   days after receipt of the notice, the contractor will be subject to the same
   consequences of debarment as described in § 2212 for a one (1)-year period,
   which shall commence on the sixteenth (16th) day after the date of the notice.

   2219.5. The Director shall include a copy of the final evaluation letter and

   Director shall issue his or her final decision on the matter within fifteen
   (15) days after receipt of the contractor’s appeal.  The Director shall base
   his or her decision on the facts as found together with any information and
   argument submitted by the contractor.

   2219.7. If the Director in his or her final decision decides not to change the

   period; and
   
   
   
   (d)	A statement that the debarment period shall commence on the thirty-first
   (31st) day after the date of the final written decision if the contractor
   chooses not to appeal the final decision, or the day after the CAB dismisses
   or denies the contractor’s appeal.

   2219.8. If the Director in his or her final decision decides to change the
   cumulative grade of F, the Director shall notify the contractor of his or her
   decision by certified mail, return receipt requested.
