SUBCONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITY (§ 27-2203)

2203.1. Except as provided in §2212.6, a prospective prime contractor shall
   be accountable for determining the responsibility of prospective
   subcontractors. The prime contractor shall use the requirements and standards
   for responsibility set forth in this chapter.

   2203.2. Because the determination of a prospective subcontractor’s
   responsibility may affect the District’s determination of the prospective
   prime contractor’s responsibility, a prospective contractor may be required
   to provide written evidence of a proposed subcontractor’s responsibility.

   2203.3. When it is in the best interests of the District, the contracting
   officer may independently determine a prospective subcontractor&#8217;s
   responsibility using the standards and requirements for responsibility set
   forth in this chapter.
