                                  DC REGULATIONS

PREAWARD SURVEYS (ยง 27-2206)

2206.1. The contracting officer may require a preaward survey to assist in
   determining a prospective contractor&#8217;s capability to perform a proposed
   contract.

   2206.2. If the contemplated contract will be ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or
   less, or will have a fixed price of less than one hundred thousand dollars
   ($100,000) and will involve only commercial products, the contracting officer
   shall not request a preaward survey unless circumstances justify the cost of
   the survey.

   2206.3. Before beginning a preaward survey, the contracting officer shall
   ascertain whether the prospective contractor is debarred, suspended, or
   ineligible. If the prospective contractor is debarred, suspended, or
   ineligible, the contracting officer shall not proceed with the preaward
   survey.

   2206.4. When the prospective contractor surveyed is a certified minority
   business, the contracting officer shall request information and advice
   concerning the contractor&#8217;s capability and past performance from the
   District of Columbia Local Business Opportunity Commission before making a
   determination regarding the contractor&#8217;s responsibility or
   nonresponsibility.

   2206.5. When a preaward survey discloses unsatisfactory performance, the
   contracting officer shall determine the extent to which the prospective
   contractor plans, or has taken, corrective action.

   2206.6. The preaward survey report shall indicate any persistent pattern of
   need under prior contracts for costly and burdensome District assistance to
   the contractor (such as engineering, inspection, or testing) that were
   provided to protect the District&#8217;s interests but not contractually
   required.

   2206.7. The contracting officer shall prepare a narrative preaward survey
   report that documents the results of the preaward survey and provides support
   for both the evaluation ratings and the determination of responsibility or
   nonresponsibility.

   2206.8. The preaward survey report shall, as necessary, include information
   concerning the contractor&#8217;s technical capabilities, financial
   capability, quality assurance procedures, and the quality of the
   contractor&#8217;s accounting system.

   2206.9. The preaward survey report shall be prepared in the form prescribed by
   the Director.
