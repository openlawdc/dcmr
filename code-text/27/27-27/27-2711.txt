REINSURANCE (ยง 27-2711)

2711.1. If reinsurance is contemplated, the contracting officer may require
   reinsurance agreements to be executed and submitted with the securities before
   making a final determination on the securities.

   2711.2. When specified in the solicitation, the contracting officer may accept
   a security from the direct writing company in satisfaction of the total bond
   requirement of the contract. This shall be permissible until necessary
   reinsurance agreements are executed, even though the total security
   requirement may exceed the insurer&#8217;s underwriting limitation.

   2711.3. The contractor shall execute and submit necessary reinsurance
   agreements to the contracting officer within the time specified in the
   solicitation, which shall not exceed forty-five (45) calendar days after the
   execution of the security.
