                                  DC REGULATIONS

NONCOMPLIANCE WITH BID SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (ยง 27-2702)

2702.1. If a bid fails to comply with the bid security requirements set forth
   in the solicitation, the contracting officer shall reject the bid. However,
   the contracting officer may accept the bid if the contracting officer
   determines in writing that both of the following apply:
   
   
   
   (a)	The bid or proposal meets the criteria set forth in this section; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Acceptance of the bid or proposal would be in the best interests of the
   District.

   2702.2. If only one bid is received, the bid may be accepted and the
   contracting officer shall require the furnishing of the bid security before
   the contract is signed.

   2702.3. If the amount of the bid security is less than required, but is equal
   to or greater than the difference between the bid price and the next higher
   acceptable bid, the bid may be accepted.

   2702.4. If the amount of the bid security submitted, although less than that
   required by the solicitation for the maximum quantity bid upon, is sufficient
   for a quantity for which the bidder is otherwise eligible for award, the bid
   may be accepted. Any award to the bidder or offeror shall not exceed the
   quantity covered by the bid security.

   2702.5. If the bid security becomes inadequate as a result of the correction
   of a mistake, the bid may be accepted if the bidder agrees to increase the bid
   security to the level required for the corrected bid.

   2702.6. If the bid security is received late, and late receipt is waived in
   accordance with ยง1523 of this title, the bid may be accepted.
