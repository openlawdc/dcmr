INDIRECT COSTS (ยง 27-3313)

3313.1. An indirect cost shall not be allocated to a District contract if
   other costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances have been
   included as a direct cost of that contract or any final cost objective not
   related to the District contract.

   3313.2. Indirect costs shall be accumulated into logical groupings known as
   &#8220;indirect cost pools.&#8221;

   3313.3. The contractor&#8217;s method of allocating indirect costs shall be in
   accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which are
   consistently applied, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

   3313.4. The contracting officer shall examine the contractor&#8217;s method of
   allocating indirect costs when any of the following apply:
   
   
   
   (a)	A substantial difference exists between the cost patterns of work
   performed under the contract and the contractor&#8217;s other work;
   
   
   
   (b)	A significant change occurs in the nature of the contractor&#8217;s
   business, extent of subcontracting, fixed asset improvement programs,
   inventories, volume of saves and production, manufacturing process, products,
   or other relevant circumstances; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Indirect cost groups developed for a contractor&#8217;s primary location
   are applied to off-site locations, in which case separate cost groups for
   costs allocable to off-site locations may be necessary to distribute the
   contractor&#8217;s costs on the basis of the benefits accruing to the
   appropriate cost objective.

   3313.5. The contracting officer shall consider the base period for indirect
   cost allocation as the one in which the costs are incurred and accumulated for
   distribution to work performed in that period.
