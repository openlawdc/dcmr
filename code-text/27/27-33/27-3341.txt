PERSONNEL COSTS RELATED TO LABOR-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS (ยง 27-3341)

3341.1. The costs of employee services based on a labor-management agreement
   shall be allowable only to the extent that the contracting officer determines
   that the agreement does not discriminate against the District, and the
   personnel costs are warranted by the character and circumstances of the work
   performed under the contract. A labor-management agreement shall be deemed to
   discriminate against the District if it results in employee compensation in
   any form that is in excess of compensation paid for non-District work under
   similar circumstances.

   3341.2. The contracting officer shall not disallow costs for compensation
   resulting from labor-management agreements unless the contractor has been
   permitted an opportunity to justify the costs, and consideration has been
   given to whether unusual conditions pertain to the District contract work
   which imposes burdens, hardships, or hazards on the contractor&#8217;s
   employees for which compensation that might otherwise appear unreasonable is
   required to attract and hold necessary personnel,
