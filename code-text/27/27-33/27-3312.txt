DIRECT COSTS (ยง 27-3312)

3312.1. Direct costs associated with District contracts shall be segregated
   from other costs and recorded in accounts identifying them with the particular
   contract or cost objective to the maximum extent possible.

   3312.2. Costs specifically identified with final cost objectives that are
   unrelated to District contracts, including other contracts or general business
   objectives of the contractor, shall not be charged to a District contract
   directly or indirectly.

   3312.3. Any direct cost of a minor dollar amount may be treated as an indirect
   cost if the accounting treatment used is consistently applied and produces
   substantially the same result as treating the cost as a direct cost. A minor
   dollar amount shall be an amount not in excess of one half percent (1/2%) of
   the contract price.

   3312.4. Any cost that has been allocated to any indirect cost pool or
   objective shall not be allowed as a direct cost.
