   3322.3. Service and warranty costs that include costs arising from the

   installation, training, correcting defects in the products, replacing
   defective parts, and making refunds in the case of inadequate performance)
   shall be allowable when consistent with the terms of the contract and when the
   allowance of the costs would not result in a double payment by the District
   for correction of defects.
