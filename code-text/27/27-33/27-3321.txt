DEPRECIATION AND USE ALLOWANCES (ยง 27-3321)

3321.1. Normal depreciation on a contractor&#8217;s plant, equipment, and
   other capital facilities shall be allowable. The contracting officer shall
   require the contractor to demonstrate that the depreciation costs are
   reasonable and allocable.

   3321.2. Depreciation shall be considered reasonable if the contractor
   demonstrates the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The methods for determining depreciation costs are consistent with those
   followed by businesses (other than the government) with respect to each class
   of property;
   
   
   
   (b)	The depreciation costs are reflected in the contractor&#8217;s books of
   accounts and financial statements; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The depreciation costs are both used and acceptable for federal income tax
   purposes.

   3321.3. The computation of depreciation or use allowances shall be based on
   acquisition costs. If acquisition costs are unknown, a reasonable estimate may
   be used.

   3321.4. Depreciation shall be computed using any generally accepted accounting
   method. The method shall be consistently applied and result in equitable
   charges considering the use of the property.

   3321.5. The contracting officer shall accept any method of depreciation which
   is accepted by the Internal Revenue Service.

   3321.6. A use allowance shall be allowable if it is computed in accordance
   with an established industry or government schedule or other method mutually
   agreed upon by the contracting officer and the contractor.
