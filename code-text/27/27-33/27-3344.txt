                                  DC REGULATIONS

EXPERT AND CONSULTANT SERVICES COSTS (ยง 27-3344)

3344.1. Except as provided in ยง3344.2, costs of expert and consultant
   services shall be allowable when reasonable in relation to the services
   rendered and when not contingent upon recovery of costs from the District.

   3344.2. In determining the allowability of expert and consultant services
   costs, the contracting officer shall consider the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The nature and scope of the services rendered in relation to the services
   required under the contract;
   
   
   
   (b)	The necessity of contracting for the service considering the
   contractor&#8217;s capability in the particular area;
   
   
   
   (c)	The past pattern of the contractor&#8217;s incurring this type of costs,
   particularly in the years prior to the award of District contracts;
   
   
   
   (d)	The impact of District contracts in the contractor&#8217;s business;
   
   
   
   (e)	Whether the proportion of District work to the contractor&#8217;s total
   business justifies incurring the cost, particularly when the services rendered
   are not of a continuing nature and have little relationship to work under
   District contracts;
   
   
   
   (f)	Whether the service can be performed more economically by employment
   rather than by contracting;
   
   
   
   (g)	The qualifications of the individual or firm rendering the service and the
   customary fee charged, especially on non-government contracts; and
   
   
   
   (h)	The adequacy of the contractual agreement for the services, including the
   description of the service, the estimate the time required, rate of
   compensation, and termination provisions.

   3344.3. Fees for services rendered shall be allowable only when supported by
   evidence of the nature and scope of the service furnished.
