                                  DC REGULATIONS

SPECIAL TOOLING AND SPECIAL TEST EQUIPMENT COSTS (ยง 27-3328)

3328.1. The cost of special tooling and special test equipment used in
   performing one (1) or more District contracts shall be allowable and shall be
   allocated to the specific District contract or contracts for which it was
   procured.

   3328.2. The cost of items procured by the contractor before the effective date
   of the contract, or the replacement of those items, whether altered or adapted
   for use in performing the contract, and items which the contract schedule
   specifically excludes shall be allowable only as depreciation or amortization.

   3328.3. If items are disqualified as special tooling or special test equipment
   because they can be made suitable for general purpose use at relatively minor
   cost and have a general use value commensurate with their value as special
   tooling or special test equipment, the cost of adapting the items for use
   under the contract and the cost of returning them to their prior configuration
   shall be allowable.
