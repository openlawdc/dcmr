                                  DC REGULATIONS

CRITERIA FOR USE OF WARRANTIES (ยง 27-4027)

4027.1. The contracting officer shall determine whether a warranty is
   appropriate for each specific procurement. If a warranty is appropriate, the
   contracting officer shall use a warranty clause, approved by the Director,
   consistent with the contractor&#8217;s performance obligations under the
   contract.

   4027.2. In determining whether a warranty is appropriate for a specific
   procurement, the contracting officer shall consider the following factors:
   
   
   
   (a)	The nature and use of the goods, services, or construction such as
   complexity and function, degree of development, state of the art, end use,
   difficulty in detecting defects before acceptance, and potential harm to the
   District if the item is defective;
   
   
   
   (b)	Costs arising from the contractor&#8217;s charge for accepting the
   deferred liability created by the warranty and the District&#8217;s
   administration and enforcement of the warranty;
   
   
   
   (c)	The District&#8217;s ability to enforce the warranty, and the assurance
   that an adequate administrative system for reporting defects exists or will be
   established;
   
   
   
   (d)	Whether there is the practice in the trade of customarily warranting the
   supply, service, or construction, and whether the cost of the supply, service,
   or construction will therefore be the same whether a warranty is included;
   
   
   
   (e)	The possible reduction of the District&#8217;s quality assurance
   requirements where the warranty provides adequate assurance of a satisfactory
   product; and
   
   
   
   (f)	Any other factors that the contracting officer deems appropriate for the
   specific procurement.
