CONTRACT QUALITY ASSURANCE FOR SMALL PURCHASES (§ 27-4009)

4009.1. In determining the type and extent of District contract quality
   assurance to be required for small purchases, the contracting officer shall
   consider the criticality of application of the goods or services, the amount
   of possible losses, and the likelihood of uncontested replacement of defective
   work.

   4009.2. Except as provided in §4009.5, when the circumstances set forth in
   §4004.6 exist, the District shall inspect shall purchases at destination only
   for type and kind, quantity, damage, operability, and may inspect for
   preservation, packaging, packing, and marking, if applicable.

   4009.3. Except as provided in §4004.6, detailed District inspection may be
   limited to those characteristics that are special or likely to cause harm to
   personnel or property.

   4009.4. Except as provided in §4004.6, when repetitive purchases of the same
   item are made from the same manufacturer with a history of defect-free work,
   District inspection may be reduced to a periodic check of purchases.

   4009.5. In special situations such as those specified in §4007, the
   contracting officer may require more detailed quality assurance.
