                                  DC REGULATIONS

CONTRACTOR LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO DISTRICT PROPERTY (§ 27-4033)

4033.1. The provisions of this section shall apply to contractor liability for
   loss of or damage to District property that occurs after acceptance as a
   result of defects or deficiencies in the goods delivered or services
   performed.

   4033.2. Except as provided in §§4033.4 and 4033.5, the District shall act as
   a self-insurer by relieving contractors, as specified in this section, of
   liability for loss of or damage to property of the District that occurs after
   acceptance of goods delivered or services performed under a contract as a
   result of defects or deficiencies in the goods or services. However, the
   District shall not relieve the contractor of liability for loss of or damage
   to the contract end item itself, except for high-value items.

   4033.3. Except as provided in §§4033.4 and 4033.5, in contracts requiring
   delivery of high- value items, the District shall relieve contractors of
   contractual liability for loss of or damage to those items. However, the
   relief shall not limit the District&#8217;s rights arising under the contract
   to do the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Have any defective item or its components corrected, repaired, or replaced
   when the defect or deficiency is discovered before the loss of or damage to
   high-value items occurs; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Obtain equitable relief when the defect or deficiency is discovered after
   such loss or damage occurs.

   4033.4. The District shall not provide the contractual relief specified in
   §§4033.2 and 4033.3 when contractor liability can be preserved without
   increasing the contract price.

   4033.5. Subject to the specific terms of the limitation of liability clause
   included in the contract, the relief provided under §§4033.2 and 4033.3
   shall not apply, as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	To the extent that contractor liability is expressly provided for under a
   contract clause approved by the Director;
   
   
   
   (b)	When a defect or deficiency in, or the District&#8217;s acceptance of, the
   goods, services, or construction results from willful misconduct or lack of
   good faith on the part of the contractor or its agent; or
   
   
   
   (c)	To the extent that any contractor insurance, or self-insurance reserve,
   covers liability for loss or damage suffered by the District through purchase
   or use of the goods delivered or services performed under the contract.

   4033.6. For items being priced at or based on catalog or market prices, the
   contracting officer shall not provide relief to contractors unless they can
   obtain a reduction from the catalog or market price which reflects the reduced
   contractor liability. The contracting officer shall include a clause, approved
   by the Director, to inform bidders and offerors of the provisions of this
   subsection.
