                                  DC REGULATIONS

CERTIFICATE OF CONFORMANCE (ยง 27-4021)

4021.1. A certificate of conformance may be used instead of source inspection,
   whether the contract calls for acceptance at the source or at destination, at
   the discretion of the contracting officer, if the following conditions apply:
   
   
   
   (a)	Acceptance on the basis of a contractor&#8217;s certificate of conformance
   is in the best interests of the District; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Either small losses would be incurred in the event of a defect; or, based
   on the contractor&#8217;s reputation or past performance, it is likely that
   the goods or services furnished will be acceptable and any defective work
   would be replaced, corrected, or repaid without contest.

   4021.2. Even if a certificate of conformance is used pursuant to ยง4021.1, the
   District&#8217;s right to inspect goods, services, and construction under the
   inspection provisions of the contract shall not be prejudiced.
