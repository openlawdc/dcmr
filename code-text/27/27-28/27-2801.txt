CONTRACTING OFFICER&#8217;S RESPONSIBILITIES (ยง 27-2801)

2801.1. The contracting officer shall ensure that any requirements for consent
   to subcontract are included in the solicitation for the prime contract.

   2801.2. The contracting officer&#8217;s consent to subcontract shall not
   constitute a determination of the acceptability of the subcontract terms,
   price, or allowability of costs, unless the consent to subcontract specifies
   otherwise.

   2801.3. The contracting officer shall not consent to subcontract in any of the
   following instances:
   
   
   
   (a)	When the fee in a cost-reimbursement subcontract exceeds any applicable
   fee limitations;
   
   
   
   (b)	When a payment under the subcontract is on a
   cost-plus-a-percentage-of-	cost basis;
   
   
   
   (c)	When the contracting officer is obligated to deal directly with the
   subcontractor;
   
   
   
   (d)	When the results of arbitration, judicial determination, or voluntary
   settlement between the prime contractor and subcontractor are made binding on
   the District; or
   
   
   
   (e)	When there is a repetitive or unduly protracted use of cost-reimbursement,
   time-and-materials, or labor-hour subcontracts.

   2801.4. The contracting officer shall not refuse consent to subcontract merely
   because the subcontract contains a clause giving the subcontractor the right
   of indirect appeal to the Contract Appeals Board if the subcontractor is
   affected by a dispute between the District and the prime contractor.
