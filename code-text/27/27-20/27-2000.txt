                                  DC REGULATIONS

MULTIYEAR CONTRACTS (§ 27-2000)

2000.1. Unless prohibited by the provisions of an appropriations act, a
   contracting officer may issue the following types of contracts on a multiyear
   basis:
   
   
   
   (a)	Firm-fixed-price contracts;
   
   
   
   (b)	Fixed-price contracts with economic adjustments;
   
   
   
   (c)	Fixed-priced incentive contracts; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Cost-reimbursement contracts.

   2000.2. Multiyear contracting may be used in procurement by competitive sealed
   bids or competitive sealed proposals, or by sole source procurement.

   2000.3. Multiyear procurement may be used for sheltered market solicitations.

   2000.4. The term of a multiyear contract shall not be longer than five (5)
   years.

   2000.5. Each multiyear contract shall provide that, after the end of each
   fiscal year, the contract shall be canceled (pursuant to a multiyear
   cancellation clause approved by the Director) if sufficient budget authority
   is not available to fund the contract during the subsequent fiscal year.

   2000.6. Before issuing a multiyear contract, the contracting officer shall
   determine the following in writing:
   
   
   
   (a)	That the contract requires the special production of definite quantities
   or the furnishing of long-term services to meet the District&#8217;s needs;
   
   
   
   (b)	That there is a reasonable expectation that, throughout the contemplated
   contract period, the requesting agency will request sufficient budget
   authority to fund the contract at the level required to avoid contract
   cancellation;
   
   
   
   (c)	That any technical risks associated with the item or service is not
   excessive;
   
   
   
   (d)	That a multiyear contract will serve the best interests of the District by
   encouraging competition or otherwise promoting economies in procurement; and
   
   
   
   (e)	That estimated requirements cover the period of the contract and are
   reasonably firm and continuing.

   2000.7. Budget authority to fund a multiyear contract shall be obligated on an
   annual basis. The initial obligation of funds shall be for the first fiscal
   year requirements of the contract, and funds for requirements in each
   subsequent fiscal year shall be obligated one (1) fiscal year at a time.

   2000.8. The contracting officer may use a pre-bid, pre-proposal, or
   pre-solicitation conference to ensure that all interested sources are informed
   of the special nature of multiyear contracts, including all cancellation
   provisions required by this chapter.
