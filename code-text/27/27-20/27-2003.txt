LOWEST EVALUATED UNIT PRICE (ยง 27-2003)

2003.1. To determine the lowest evaluated bid price, the contracting officer
   shall compare the lowest evaluated offer on the first fiscal year alternative
   against the lowest evaluated offer on the multiyear alternative, as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	Multiply the evaluated unit price for each item of the lowest evaluated
   offer on the first fiscal year alternative by the number of units of that item
   required by the multiyear alternative;
   
   
   
   (b)	Add the total amount for all the items to the dollar amount of any
   administrative costs identified in the solicitation; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Compare the result of the computations performed under ยง2003.1(a) and (b)
   against the total evaluated price of the lowest offer on the multiyear
   alternative.

   2003.2. If the multiyear procurement is being computed on a basis other than
   price alone, the contracting officer shall conduct the evaluation based on the
   evaluation factors contained in the solicitation.
