EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (§ 27-2007)

2007.1. Except as provided in §§2007.2 and 2007.3, when awarding the basic
   contract, the contracting officer shall evaluate offers for any options
   contained in a solicitation when it has been determined prior to soliciting
   offers that the District is likely to exercise the options.

   2007.2. The contracting officer shall not evaluate offers for any option when
   it is determined that evaluation would not be in the best interests of the
   District.

   2007.3. The contracting officer may determine not to evaluate options due to
   circumstances including, but not limited to, the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	There is not a reasonable certainty that sufficient budget authority will
   be available to permit the exercise of the option; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The option would not be exercisable at a price specified in, or reasonably
   determined from, the terms of the basic contract.

   2007.4. Except as provided in this section, in order to meet the requirements
   of the Act and this title for maximum competition, each option shall be
   evaluated as part of the initial competition, and be exercisable at an amount
   specified from the terms of the basic contract.
