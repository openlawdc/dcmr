                                  DC REGULATIONS

USE OF OPTIONS (§ 27-2005)

2005.1. Except as provided in §§2005.2 and 2005.3, a contracting officer may
   include an option in a contract when the option is in the best interests of
   the District.

   2005.2. A contracting officer shall not use an option (unless compelling
   factors favoring the use of an option exist) when, in the judgment of the
   contracting officer, the foreseeable requirements involve the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Quantities large enough to permit the recovery of start-up costs and the
   production of required goods at a reasonable price; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Delivery requirements far enough into the future to permit competitive
   procurement, production, and delivery.

   2005.3. A contracting officer shall not use an option in any of the following
   circumstances:
   
   
   
   (a)	If the contractor would incur undue risks, such as when the price or
   availability of necessary materials or labor is not reasonably foreseeable;
   
   
   
   (b)	If an indefinite quantity or requirements term contract would be more
   appropriate, provided that a contracting officer may use an option to extend
   the term of these types of contracts;
   
   
   
   (c)	If market prices for the goods or services involved are likely to change
   substantially; or
   
   
   
   (d)	If the option represents known firm requirements for which funds are
   available, unless the basic quantity is a learning or testing quantity and
   competition for the option would be impractical after the initial contract is
   awarded.

   2005.4. A contracting officer may include options in a contract for services
   if there is an anticipated need for similar services beyond the first contract
   period.

   2005.5. The period within which an option may be exercised may extend beyond
   the date specified for completion of the services in a contract for services,
   but in no event shall the option be exercised after the contract term has
   expired.

   2005.6. The base period in a contract for services or goods shall not exceed
   one (1) year, unless the contract is funded from an appropriation that is
   available for more than one (1) year or is a multiyear contract for which
   funds would otherwise be available for obligation only within the fiscal year
   for which appropriated pursuant to District law codified at D.C. Official Code
   § 1-204.51(c). The total of the base and option periods in a contract for
   services or goods shall not exceed five (5) years unless:
   
   
   
   (a)	prior to solicitation, the Chief Procurement Officer or designee
   determines in writing that it is in the best interest of the District and the
   solicitation for the contract specifies the total of the base and option
   periods of the contract; or
   
   
   
   (b)	prior to the expiration of a contract, the Chief Procurement Officer or
   designee determines in writing that it is in the best interest of the District
   to extend the term beyond the total term specified in the contract and the
   contracting officer provides justification for using a sole source
   modification in accordance with chapter 17 of this title.

   2005.7. The total of the basic and option quantities in a contract for goods
   shall not exceed the requirement for the basic and option periods, unless
   otherwise authorized by law.

   2005.8. The contracting officer shall justify in writing the quantities or the
   term under option, the notification period for exercising the option, and any
   limitation on the option price. The contracting officer shall include the
   justification document in the contract file.

   2005.9. Any written determination and findings required for a contract entered
   into by negotiations shall specify both the basic requirement and the increase
   permitted by an option.

   2005.10. The cost of each option shall be readily discernible from the
   contract provisions that set forth the option.

   2005.11. Contract provisions, approved by the Director, setting forth the cost
   of the option may include, but are not limited to, the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	A specific dollar amount;
   
   
   
   (b)	An amount to be determined by applying provisions (or a formula) provided
   in the basic contract, but not including renegotiation of the price for work
   in a fixed-price type contract;
   
   
   
   (c)	In a cost-type contract, a stated fixed or maximum fee, or a fixed or
   maximum fee amount determined by applying a formula contained in the basic
   contract;
   
   
   
   (d)	A specific price that is subject to an economic price adjustment
   provision; or
   
   
   
   (e)	A specific price that is subject to change as a result of changes to the
   prevailing labor rates provided by the U.S. Department of Labor.
