CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS (§ 27-4626)

4626.1. The Contracting Officer may modify a contract subject to the
   provisions of this section.

   4626.2. A modification must be within the general scope of the original
   contract.  Any requirement for extra work that goes beyond the contract’s
   general scope shall be the subject of a new procurement.

   4626.3. A contract modification in excess of one hundred thousand dollars
   ($100,000) shall be approved by the CCO.

   4626.4. A contract modification may be effected:
   
   
   
   (a)	By a bilateral agreement executed by the Contracting Officer and an
   authorized representative of the contractor; or
   
   
   
   (b)	By the Contracting Officer’s issuance of a written change order, when
   the contract includes a changes clause permitting the Contracting Officer to
   make unilateral changes in the contract work.  Under such a clause, the
   contractor is obligated to perform in accordance with a change order issued by
   the Contracting Officer, and the contract price is adjusted to reflect the
   increase or decrease in costs caused by the change.
