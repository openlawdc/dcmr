TIME AND MATERIALS CONTRACTS AND LABOR HOURS CONTRACTS (ยง 27-4616)

4616.1. Time-and-materials contracts provide for acquiring supplies or
   services on the basis of:
   
   
   
   (a)	Direct labor hours charged at fixed hourly rates that include overhead and
   profit; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Materials (which may be charged either at their actual cost or at fixed
   unit prices).
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
               A labor hours contract is a time-and-materials contract that does
   not involve materials. 
   
   
   
   
   
               Both time-and-materials contracts and labor hours contracts should
   specify a ceiling price.
