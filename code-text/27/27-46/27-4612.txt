                                  DC REGULATIONS

FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS (§ 27-4612)

4612.1. Fixed price contracts include several variants:
   
   
   
   (a)	Firm, fixed price contracts;
   
   
   
   (b)	Fixed price contracts with economic price adjustment; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Fixed price incentive contracts.

   4612.2. Unlike cost reimbursement contracts, any type of fixed price contract
   obligates the contractor to complete the contractually-specified work for a
   fixed price.

   4612.3. A firm fixed price contract provides for a price that is not subject
   to adjustment, except in the event of a change to the scope of work.

   4612.4. A fixed price contract with economic price adjustment provides for an
   upward or downward adjustment in the stated contract price based on changes in
   certain benchmarks specifically identified in the contract (for example,
   catalog prices or the producer price index for a particular commodity),
   subject to a ceiling on upward adjustments.

   4612.5. A fixed price incentive contract generally provides for establishing a
   final price by applying a formula based on the relationship between the total
   cost actually incurred by the contractor and a total target cost.  A fixed
   price incentive contract results in the parties sharing in the cost savings or
   increases associated with differences between the actual and target cost. 
   These contracts also can include incentive formulas based on the
   contractor’s schedule or technical performance.
