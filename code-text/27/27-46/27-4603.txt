                                  DC REGULATIONS

DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO CONTRACTING OFFICERS (§ 27-4603)

4603.1. The CCO may delegate contracting authority to employees of the
   Hospital, or employees of the District of Columbia government acting on behalf
   of the Hospital, who shall be designated as Contracting Officers.  Any such
   delegation shall be in writing and shall specify any limits on a Contracting
   Officer’s delegated authority (for example, limits on the dollar value of
   contracts the individual is authorized to award).

   4603.2. In delegating contracting authority, the CCO shall ensure that each
   delegated Contracting Officer has the experience, knowledge, and judgment
   necessary to fulfill the duties of a Contracting Officer, including a solid
   understanding of the Hospital’s procurement rules.  Subject to compliance
   with these rules, Contracting Officers shall have wide latitude to exercise
   business judgment in conducting procurements.  Consequently, the ability to
   exercise that discretion wisely and responsibly is an important job
   qualification.  In addition, the CCO shall ensure that Contracting Officers
   periodically receive training to strengthen and update their skills and
   knowledge concerning procurement matters.
