   “Termination for Default” and “Termination for Convenience” clauses
   specifically defining the Hospital’s termination rights.

   4627.2. When exercising the Hospital’s rights under a termination clause in
   the contract, the Contracting Officer shall provide the contractor with a
   written notice specifying:
   
   
   
   (a)	Whether the termination is for default or for convenience;
   
   
   
   (b)	The effective date of the termination;
   
   
   
   (c)	The extent of the termination if the termination is partial; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Any special instructions that apply to the termination (for example,
   instructions concerning the disposition of contract inventory).

   4627.3. After terminating a contract for convenience, the Contracting Officer
   shall request a settlement proposal from the contractor and shall attempt to
   negotiate a settlement that resolves all of the parties’ rights and
   liabilities (except those arising from any portion of the contract still in
   effect).  If the parties negotiate a settlement, the Contracting Officer shall
   prepare a memorandum describing the principal elements of the settlement and
   shall include the memorandum in the contract file.
