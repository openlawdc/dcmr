   dismantling or demolition operation.

   1926.2. The contracting officer shall determine whether the District shall
   retain materials resulting from a dismantling or demolition operation in
   accordance with §§1926.3 and 1926.4.

   1926.3. If property is determined more useful to the District than its value
   as salvage to the contractor, the contract shall expressly designate that the
   property be retained by the District.

   determine the fair market value of any property designated as salvage which
   will be retained by the contractor. The fair market value estimate shall be a
