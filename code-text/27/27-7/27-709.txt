TEMPORARY CERTIFICATION (§ 27-709)

709.1. The Staff Director of the Commission may issue to an applicant a
   temporary certification for bidding purposes only when all of the following
   requirements are satisfied:
   
   
   
   (a)	The applicant has submitted a completed application for certification
   under §700 of this chapter.
   
   
   
   (b)	The completed application is scheduled to be reviewed by the Commission at
   its next scheduled meeting;
   
   
   
   (c)	The application is certifiable under §700 based on staff review and
   recommendation;
   
   
   
   (d)	The Staff Director determines, given the character of the contract at
   issue, the likelihood of such a contract being offered again in the sheltered
   market, and the amount of the contract, that the applicant&#8217;s inability
   to bid on the contract would have a detrimental effect on the development of
   MBE&#8217;s in the District of Columbia; and
   
   
   
   (f)	The Staff Director has the approval of at least four (4) Commissioners for
   temporary certification for bidding purposes.

   709.2. Temporary certification for bidding shall have no significance in the
   Commission&#8217;s review of the application for certification under §700 of
   this chapter.

   709.3. An applicant who has received temporary certification for bidding may
   only bid on contracts placed in the sheltered market. An applicant shall not
   be qualified as a MBE to be awarded a contract placed in the sheltered market
   until the applicant is certified pursuant to §700 of this chapter.
