   contracting officers shall not execute contract modifications or:

   believe that they have authority to bind the District; or

   which work is being performed, which should be the subject of a contract

   to perform work, alter schedules or specifications, or any other action that
   would normally require a written contract modification.

   3602.3. The District shall not be responsible for any costs incurred by a
   contractor for any additional work or other actions by a contractor outside
   the scope of the written contract and written contract modifications signed by
   the contracting officer.
