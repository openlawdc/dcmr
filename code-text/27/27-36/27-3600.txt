                                  DC REGULATIONS

GENERAL PROVISIONS (ยง 27-3600)

3600.1. Only a contracting officer acting within the scope of the contracting
   officer&#8217;s delegated contract authority is authorized to execute a
   contract modification on behalf of the District. Other District personnel
   shall not:
   
   
   
   (a)	Execute contract modifications;
   
   
   
   (b)	Act in a manner that causes a contractor to believe that they have
   authority to bind the District; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Direct or encourage a contractor to perform work that should be the
   subject of a contract modification.

   3600.2. A contract modification, including a change issued unilaterally by the
   District, shall be priced and a government estimate shall be prepared before
   signature by the parties, unless the interest of the District would be
   adversely affected. If a significant cost increase could result from a
   contract modification and time does not permit negotiation of a price, the
   contracting officer shall negotiate a maximum contract price increase and
   include that price in the modification.

   3600.3. The contracting officer shall not execute a contract modification,
   including a change order, which causes or will cause an increase in the
   funding level of the contract without having first obtained a certification of
   the availability of funds. The certification shall be based on the negotiated
   price or the negotiated maximum price.

   3600.4. A modification to a contract may be executed without having first
   obtained the certification required under ยง 3600.3 if the modification
   includes a clause, approved by the Director, which conditions payment upon the
   availability of funds.
