VARIATION IN QUANTITY[COLON] SUPPLY CONTRACTS (ยง 27-2304)

2304.1. A fixed-price supply contract may authorize District acceptance of a
   variation in the quantity of items if the variation is caused by conditions of
   loading, shipping, packing, or by allowances in manufacturing processes.

   2304.2. Except as provided in ยง2304.3, any permissible variation shall be
   stated as a percentage. The variation may be an increase, a decrease, or a
   combination of both.

   2304.3. Contracts for subsistence items may use other applicable terms of
   variations in quantity.

   2304.4. There shall be no standard or usual variation percentage.

   2304.5. The overrun or underrun permitted in each contract shall be based upon
   the normal commercial practices of a particular industry for a particular
   item, and the permitted percentage shall be no larger than is necessary to
   afford a contractor reasonable protection.

   2304.6. The permissible variation shall not exceed plus or minus ten percent
   (10%), unless a different limitation is established by the contracting
   officer.

   2304.7. In establishing the permissible variations, the contracting officer
   shall consider the quantity of items to which the percentage variation
   applies.

   2304.8. Contractors shall be responsible for delivery of the specified
   quantity of items in a fixed-price contract, within allowable variations, if
   any.
