                                  DC REGULATIONS

LIQUIDATED DAMAGES (ยง 27-2303)

2303.1. In addition to the requirement for a liquidated damages clause in
   certain construction contracts under ยง507(a) of the Procurement Practices Act
   of 1985 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;), D.C. Code ยง1-1185.7, and Chapter 26 of this
   title, a liquidated damages clause approved by the Director may be used in a
   contract when the following factors apply:
   
   
   
   (a)	The time of delivery or performance is such an important factor in the
   award of the contract that the District may reasonably expect to suffer
   damages if the delivery or performance is delinquent; or
   
   
   
   (b)	The extent or amount of damages would be difficult or impossible to
   ascertain or prove.

   2303.2. When deciding whether to include a liquidated damages clause in a
   contract, the contracting officer shall consider the probable effect on
   pricing, competition, the costs and difficulties of contract administration,
   and similar matters.

   2303.3. In order to avoid setting an unenforceable penalty, liquidated damages
   shall not be fixed without reference to probable actual damages. The
   contracting officer shall determine a reasonable rate of liquidated damages on
   a case by case basis.

   2303.4. The contracting officer shall set the rate of liquidated damages based
   on the recommendations and justifications provided by the agency initiating
   the procurement request and the contracting officer&#8217;s assessment of all
   applicable factors.

   2303.5. The contracting officer shall document the justification of the rate
   of liquidated damages in the contract file.

   2303.6. A contract may include an overall maximum dollar amount or period of
   time during which liquidated damages may be assessed, or both, to prevent an
   unreasonable assessment of liquidated damages.

   2303.7. The contracting officer shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate
   liquidated damages.

   2303.8. If a liquidated damages clause is included in a contract and a basis
   for termination for default exists, the contracting officer shall take
   appropriate action expeditiously to obtain performance by the contractor or to
   terminate the contract.

   2303.9. If delivery or performance is desired after termination for default,
   efforts shall be made to obtain the delivery or performance from another
   source within a reasonable time.

   2303.10. If a contract provides for liquidated damages for delay, the
   Director, on the recommendation of the contracting officer, shall be
   authorized to remit all or part of the damages if, in the discretion of the
   Director, remission would be just and equitable.
