                                  DC REGULATIONS

VARIATION IN QUANTITY[COLON] CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS (ยง 27-2305)

2305.1. Construction contracts may authorize a variation in estimated
   quantities of unit-priced items.

   2305.2. When the variation between the estimated quantity and the actual
   quantity of a unit-priced item is more than plus or minus fifteen percent
   (15%), an equitable adjustment in the contract price shall be made upon demand
   of either the contracting officer or the contractor. The contracting officer
   shall base the adjustment on the increase or decrease in the
   contractor&#8217;s costs due to the variation in quantity.

   2305.3. The contractor may request an extension of time if the quantity
   variation will increase the time necessary for completion of the contract. The
   contractor shall ensure that the contracting officer receives the request no
   later than ten (10) days after the beginning of the period of delay.

   2305.4. Pursuant to a request in accordance with ยง2305.3, the contracting
   officer may extend the time limit based on a determination that an extension
   would be in the best interests of the District.
