PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF GOOD TIME CREDITS (ยง 28-602)

The Department of Corrections may award good time credits for good behavior and
for successful participation in rehabilitative programs, work details, and
special projects for the period of time in custody prior to or after sentencing.
 Such credits shall be applied only after sentencing pursuant to D.C. Official
Code ยง 24-403.02.  Good time credits for good behavior, successful
participation in rehabilitative programs, work details, and special projects
provide inmates with an incentive to maintain good behavior and enroll in
institutional programs for purposes of self-development or rehabilitative
objectives.  The good time credits for good behavior are revoked when inmates
engage in disciplinary violations, but can be restored.  The good time credits
for successful participation in rehabilitative programs, work details, and
special projects vest once utilized and thereafter cannot be revoked.
