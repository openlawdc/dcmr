   fashion.

   received by the Office of Criminal Justice Plans and Analysis (also referred
   to in this chapter as the &#8220;OCJPA&#8221;) concerning publicly or
   privately operated community-based residential facilities housing District
   court involved persons. OCJPA shall maintain a listing of all of this type of
   facility known to the District government and the listing shall be available
   for public review.
