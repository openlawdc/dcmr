FUNDING POLICIES (ยง 28-1010)

1010.1. Applicants for Law Enforcement Assistance Administration
   (&#8220;LEAA&#8221;) Part C and Part E block grant funds shall apply on an
   annual basis and shall be eligible for up to a total of thirty-six (36) months
   of LEAA support.

   1010.2. Continuation funding for LEAA Part C and Part E funded projects after
   the initial grant award shall be considered based upon the priorities of that
   year&#8217;s approved Comprehensive Criminal Justice Plan and upon the
   demonstrated progress of the project.

   1010.3. Projects funded from Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention funds
   may be eligible for twelve (12) month, twenty-four (24) month, or thirty-six
   (36) month awards. The duration shall be stipulated at the time of the initial
   funding decision and shall be contingent upon a satisfactory review of project
   performance at twelve (12) month intervals.

   1010.4. Grant recipients that have unobligated funds at the end of their grant
   award periods shall have those funds credited against their continuation
   awards if continuation funding is requested and approved by the Board.

   1010.5. Grant recipients not requesting continuation funding that have
   unobligated balances at the end of the grant award period shall return those
   funds to OCJPA except in the following circumstances:
   
   
   
   (a)	If unobligated funds exist at the end of the total thirty-six (36) month
   eligibility, and the amount does not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000),
   the applicant may request that OCJPA approve a grant extension for a
   sufficient period of time to ensure expenditure of those remaining monies;
   
   
   
   (b)	If unobligated funds exist at the end of the thirty-six (36) month
   eligibility, and the amount exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000), the
   Criminal Justice Supervisory Board at its discretion, upon request of the
   grantee, may extend the grant for whatever time period deemed appropriate by
   the Board; and
   
   
   
   (c)	In neither case shall the extension involve the award of any additional
   LEAA funds.

   1010.6. Each grant recipient shall be required to provide matching funds equal
   to ten percent (10%) of total project cost in the first year, twenty-five
   percent (25%) of total project cost in the second year (if the project is
   refunded), and fifty percent (50%) of total project cost in the third year (if
   the project is refunded).

   1010.7. Private agencies receiving Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention
   funds may satisfy all matching requirements by the provision of soft match
   contributions.

   1010.8. Private non-profit agencies receiving Part C or Part E block grant
   funds shall be required to provide at least ten percent (10%) of total project
   cost in each year in the form of hard (cash) match. Private agencies receiving
   Part C or Part E funds may satisfy the remaining match obligation during the
   second or third project years by providing soft matching contributions.

   1010.9. The Criminal Justice Supervisory Board may, at its discretion and by a
   two-thirds (2/3) vote, exempt any private agency or organization from the
   matching requirements; provided, that the total matching contributions for all
   block funds awarded during that fiscal year shall equal at least ten percent
   (10%) of total project cost in the aggregate.
