                                  DC REGULATIONS

HEARING BOARD DETERMINATIONS (ยง 28-526)

526.1. If, after a hearing, the Board determines that the resident should be
   placed in segregation, the Board shall prepare, within three (3) working days
   of the hearing, a written statement containing the Board&#8217;s decision and
   the factual information upon which the decision is based.

   526.2. Except as provided in ยง 526.3, a copy of the entire written statement
   shall be furnished to the resident and the resident&#8217;s representative
   within two (2) working days of its preparation.

   526.3. If disclosing the name of any individual or any of the evidence on
   which the Board relied in making its determination would, in the Board&#8217;s
   judgment, pose a threat to the safety of any resident or other person, or
   cause a riot or other major disturbance or damage to property, the Board shall
   include that determination in the written statement.

   526.4. The Board may delete material designated under ยง 526.3 from the copy
   of the written statement given to the resident and the resident&#8217;s
   counsel or substitute counsel. The Board shall specifically describe in the
   written statement the nature of information deleted (for example,
   &#8220;telephone call from anonymous informant,&#8221; &#8220;testimony of
   eyewitness,&#8221; or other similar designation).

   526.5. If the Board makes any deletions, it shall transmit to the
   Administrator of the institution a copy of the entire record before the Board,
   including the entire written statement. This copy of the record shall be
   retained by the Administrator for a period of at least two (2) years from the
   date of the hearing.
