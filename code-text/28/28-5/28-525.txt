                                  DC REGULATIONS

CONDUCT OF HOUSING HEARINGS (ยง 28-525)

525.1. At the housing hearing, the Board shall read the written notice to the
   resident. The Department of Corrections shall then present its evidence.

   525.2. After the Department has presented its evidence, the resident shall be
   allowed to present witnesses and other evidence, subject to the limitations
   set forth in this section.

   525.3. The resident shall be allowed to call at least two (2) witnesses, but
   any right to call any number over two (2) shall be subject to control by the
   Adjustment Board.

   525.4. If the Board determines that any witness or witnesses whom the resident
   wishes to call cannot provide relevant testimony, would be unduly repetitious
   of previous testimony, or should not be called for any other good cause
   related to the safety of any resident or other person, the Board shall note in
   the record of the hearing the specific reason for limiting the number of
   witnesses.

   525.5. If the Board determines that a threat to the safety of specific
   witnesses would be posed by having the resident confront those witnesses, the
   witness may be questioned by an appropriate Department official without the
   accused being present. The results of that examination shall be considered
   part of the evidence, and a summary of the testimony shall be contained in a
   confidential report to the Administrator.

   525.6. A record of the hearing shall be made and preserved. The record shall
   be made by tape recording; provided, that if tape recording is impossible, the
   record shall be made by reasonably detailed minutes.

   525.7. If minutes are maintained, they shall be made available to the resident
   or his counsel upon request.
