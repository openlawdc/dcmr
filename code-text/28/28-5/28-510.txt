   Adjustment Board.

   510.2. If the Board determines that any witness or witnesses whom the resident
   wishes to call cannot provide relevant testimony, would be unduly repetitious
   of previous testimony, or should not be called for any other good cause
   related to the safety of any resident or other person, the Board shall note in
   the record of the hearing the specific reason for limiting the number of
   witnesses.

   510.3. Counsel or substitute counsel for the resident shall be given an
   opportunity to meet with potential witnesses at least forty-eight (48) hours
   before the adjustment hearing; provided, that no potential adverse witness may
   be compelled to meet with counsel or substitute counsel.

   and testifies against the resident, the resident&#8217;s counsel or substitute
   counsel shall be allowed to cross-examine the officer or witness.

   510.5. Except as provided in ยง 510.4, no adverse witness may be compelled to
   testify by the resident or the resident&#8217;s counsel or substitute counsel.

   510.6. If any cross-examination disrupts the proceedings, the Board shall have
   the right to curtail the cross-examination and shall note that decision in the
   record of the hearing.
