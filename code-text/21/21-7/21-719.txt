                                  DC REGULATIONS

SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL FEE-SETTING FORMULAS (§ 21-719)

719.1. The provisions of this section shall apply to the disposal of each ton
   of solid waste at the waste-handling facilities.

   719.2. The Mayor shall establish fee-setting formulas to govern the imposition
   of solid waste disposal fees. The Mayor may modify the fee-setting formulas on
   an annual basis.
   
   
   
   719.3 	The solid waste disposal fee-setting formulas shall be based upon the
   District government’s expenses for solid waste disposal operations.  The
   Mayor shall take into account the costs of operating the disposal facilities,
   including the following:
   
   
   
   	(a)  	Maintenance and administrative costs;
   
   
   
   	(b)  	Engineering services;
   
   
   
   	(c)  	Debt retirement or debt reserves;
   
   
   
   	(d)  	Landfill replacement costs; and
   
   
   
   	(e)  	Other expenses attributable to operating the District government’s
   solid waste disposal facilities.

   719.4. The solid waste disposal fee-setting formulas may take into account the
   cost differences that arise from the types of waste disposed, the method of
   disposal, and the site of disposal. The solid waste disposal fee-setting
   formulas may be derived by averaging total system costs, prorating the costs
   of disposal at a specific facility, or prorating the cost of disposal for a
   specific type of waste, whichever, is determined to be most cost effective by
   the Mayor.

   719.5. The Mayor shall impose a surcharge to be included in the solid waste
   disposal fee for the purpose of offsetting the cost of implementing and
   operating the Mayor&#8217;s solid waste reduction and multi-material recycling
   program. The amount of the surcharge shall be included in the solid waste
   disposal fee-setting formulas.

   719.6. The following fee-setting formula is established for the disposal of
   each ton of construction and demolition debris:
   
   
   
   Solid Waste Disposal Fee for Construction and Demolition Debris + Solid Waste
   Disposal Fee + Special Handling Costs + Recycling Surcharge

   719.7. The following fee-setting formula is established for the disposal of
   each ton of vehicle tires:
   
   
   
   Solid Waste Disposal Fee for Vehicle Tires = I-95 Complex Fee = Recycling
   Surcharge

   719.8. The following fee-setting formula is established for the disposal of
   each ton of the various recyclable commodities included in the
   District&#8217;s solid waste reduction and multi-material recycling program:
   
   
   
   Solid Waste Disposal Fee for Recyclable Commodities = Recycling Surcharge

   719.9. The following fee-setting formula is established for the disposal of
   each ton of solid waste, excluding those wastes specified in §§ 719.6, 719.7
   and 719.8:
   
   
   
   Solid Waste Disposal Fee = [Estimated Material Processing Costs ÷ Projected
   Tonnage] + Recycling Surcharge
   
   
   
   719.10 	The following fee-setting formula is established for the disposal of
   each ton of food waste:
   
   
   
   Solid Waste Disposal Fee for Recyclable Food Waste=Processing cost of
   recyclable food waste + Recycling Surcharge
