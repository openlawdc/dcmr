PENALTIES (ยง 21-721)

721.1. A solid waste collector who disposes of solid waste at a disposal
   facility owned by, operated by, or under contract with the District shall pay
   its disposal fees in advance by certified check or credit card, or by
   establishing an escrow account with a financial institution for monthly
   drawdowns by the District to pay for the collector&#8217;s solid waste
   disposal fees. The escrow account shall maintain a balance equivalent to sixty
   (60) days of estimated disposal fees. Estimated disposal fees shall be based
   on the average of the solid waste collector&#8217;s disposal cost from the
   preceding six (6) month period. If the disposal cost information for the
   preceding six (6) month period is not available, the Mayor shall reasonably
   determine the balance to be maintained in the escrow account. All escrow
   accounts shall be reconciled within five (5) business days after the date on
   which the solid waste disposal collector is notified of any deficiency in an
   escrow account. If the escrow account is not reconciled within five (5)
   business days, the Mayor shall impose a five percent (5%) penalty based on the
   amount due in the escrow account.
