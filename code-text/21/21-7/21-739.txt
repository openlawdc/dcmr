CESSATION OF OPERATIONS (§ 21-739)

739.1. A solid waste facility shall immediately cease operation without
   additional notice if:
   
   
   
   (a)	It is an existing solid waste facility operating under an interim
   operating permit which has been notified by the Director that its application
   for a solid waste facility permit has been denied;
   
   
   
   (b)	The Director revokes or suspends the facility&#8217;s interim operating
   permit or solid waste facility permit:
   
   
   
   (c)	The facility does not have a solid waste facility permit or an interim
   operating permit; and
   
   
   
   (d)	The facility&#8217;s solid waste permit has expired.

   739.2. The owner or operator of a solid waste facility which voluntarily and
   permanently ceases operations shall notify the Director in writing five (5)
   days prior to the closing. Failure to notify the Director shall constitute
   abandonment of the facility.

   739.3. The owner or operator of a solid waste facility which permanently
   ceases operations, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, shall remove all
   solid waste from the facility within twenty-four (24) hours following the
   closing. The facility shall also be thoroughly cleaned, including floors,
   walls, and all equipment used to handle solid waste.

   739.4. In the event that the owner or operator of a solid waste facility fails
   to act in accordance with §739.3, the Director may issue a written notice
   directing compliance.

   739.5. If the owner or operator fails to comply with the written notice issued
   pursuant to §739.4 within the time period stated in the notice, the Director
   may remove the solid waste from the facility, clean the facility, and take any
   other corrective actions as are necessary to safeguard human health, the
   public welfare, or the environment.

   739.6. The Director may assess a penalty against the person or persons named
   in the written notice issued pursuant to §739.4 equal to triple the costs of
   undertaking the actions undertaken pursuant to §739.5. The costs and
   penalties may be recouped by the District from the facility&#8217;s
   environmental mitigation bond, or by a lien against the real property and or
   equipment or any other method available under the law.
