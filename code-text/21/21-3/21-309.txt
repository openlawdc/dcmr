   309.4. A person making the request shall forward to the Customer Service

   meter for which the credit or reimbursement is sought.

   309.5. In order for a meter to be eligible for reimbursement or credit, and

   account for any costs associated with installation of the meter or for any
   costs other than a percentage of the actual cost of the meter, as described in
   Section 309.8.

   309.7. The basis for determining the amount of reimbursement or credit to be

   (b)	If the meter has been in service between one and two years, the
   reimbursement or credit amount shall be 80 percent of the cost as determined

   (g)	The General Manager may negotiate amounts calculated on a basis other than
   that described in Sections 309.8 (a-f) if the condition of the meter warrants
   such negotiation and if there are other compelling factors which are not set
   forth in Section 309.8. The General Manager shall grant such exceptions only
   in extraordinary circumstances and shall, in each case, make a written
   determination that explains the basis of the compensation or credit and the
   rationale which supports the reimbursement or credit before payment is made or
   credit is given.
