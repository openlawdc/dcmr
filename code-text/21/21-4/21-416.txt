DISMISSAL OF HEARINGS (ยง 21-416)

416.1. A petitioner may request a dismissal by filing a written petition with
   the hearing officer or orally requesting dismissal at the hearing.

   416.2. The hearing officer may, on his or her own motion, dismiss a hearing
   demand, either entirely or as to any stated issue, under any of the following
   circumstances:
   
   
   
   a)	Where the matter has previously been the subject of a hearing or the
   petitioner has previously been afforded an opportunity for a hearing on the
   same matter, and the owner or occupant has failed to preserve his or her right
   to a hearing;
   
   
   
   b)	Where the owner or occupant demanding a hearing is not a lawful owner or
   occupant or does not otherwise have a right to a hearing. This would include,
   but is not limited to, cases in which the individual is not the owner or
   occupant as defined in D.C. Law 8-136;
   
   
   
   c)	Where the petitioner has failed to file a timely hearing demand pursuant to
   the provisions of this chapter; and
   
   
   
   d)	Where the hearing officer, in his or her opinion, finds that a petition
   filed in any proceeding does not raise a question of fact or law or the claim
   is frivolous.

   416.3. The dismissal shall be in the form of an order by the hearing officer,
   which shall contain a statement of facts and law and the reason for the
   dismissal. No such order shall be necessary where all the parties have
   expressly requested the dismissal.

   416.4. The dismissal order shall be given to the parties or mailed to them at
   their last known address.
