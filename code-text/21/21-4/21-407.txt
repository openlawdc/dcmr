                                  DC REGULATIONS

ADJUSTMENT FOR LEAKS WHICH OCCUR BETWEEN THE METER AND THE STRUCTURES THAT ARE
SERVED BY THE METER AND FOR UNDERGROUND LEAKS (§ 21-407)

407.1. When a meter leak is discovered, the Authority shall make the repairs.
   A licensed plumber may make the necessary repairs at the expense of the
   Authority if the amount and nature of the repairs is approved in advance by
   the General Manager but only if the General Manager has not determined that
   the leak constitutes an emergency or unsafe condition.

   407.2. The General Manager shall investigate the cause and location when
   notified of the possibility of leaks. If the investigation discloses a leak,
   other than a meter leak, of indeterminate location in the underground service,
   or at some other location where the leak is not apparent from visual or other
   inspection, the General Manager shall determine whether the leak is on public
   space, on private property, or on property that is under the control of the
   occupant.

   407.3. If, pursuant to § 407.2 the leak is determined to have been caused by
   the Authority, or is determined to be in public space, the Authority shall
   repair the leak and the General Manager shall adjust the bill to equal the
   average consumption of water at the same premises for up to three (3) previous
   comparable periods for which records are available. If the leak is determined
   to have been caused by the owner or occupant, no adjustment shall be made.

   407.4. If, pursuant to § 407.2 the leak is determined to be on private
   property or on property that is under the control of the owner or occupant,
   the owner or occupant shall repair the leak. The General Manager may, at his
   discretion, upon request of the owner, adjust the bill(s) for the periods
   during which the leak occurred by an amount not to exceed 50% of the excess
   water usage -over the average consumption of water at the same premises for up
   to three (3) previous comparable periods for which records are available. The
   General Manager may take the following into consideration in determining
   whether there should be a reduction in the bill(s):
   
   
   
   (a)	There has been no negligence on the part of the owner or occupant in
   notifying the Department of unusual conditions indicative of a waste of water;
   
   
   
   (b)	The owner has taken steps to have the leak repaired promptly upon
   discovery of a leak on private property;
   
   
   
   (c)	Repairs have been made by a District registered plumber and approved by
   the Chief, Plumbing Inspection Branch, Department of Consumer and Regulatory
   Affairs, or his or her designee in accordance with D.C. Code §8-205;
   
   
   
   (d)	Form ES-138 has been obtained from the Authority, completed in full,
   signed by the owner or occupant, and certified by the plumber who made the
   repairs; and
   
   
   
   (e)	The request for adjustment has been made promptly.
   
   
   
   The General Manager may, at his discretion, adjust up to 100% of the excess
   sewer charges resulting from an underground leak if it is determined that the
   excess water usage did not enter the wastewater system.

   407.5. No Adjustment shall be made if the leak is determined to have been
   caused by the owner or occupant.
