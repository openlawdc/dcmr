   (b)	Not paying the current charges contained in the bill and notifying WASA in

   402.2. Challenges received after the ten-day (10) period stated in § 402.1

   interest, and administrative costs.

   402.4. An owner or occupant may appeal a practicability determination made by

   Administrative Hearing.&#8221;
   
   
   
   402.7 	Non-residential and multi-family owners or their agents may seek an
