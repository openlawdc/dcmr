                                  DC REGULATIONS

OPPORTUNITY FOR A TENANT TO RECEIVE SERVICE IN OWN NAME (ยง 21-428)

428.1. WASA may permit the tenant(s) to receive the bills in their own name,
   when the owner or agent of the rental property fails to pay the delinquent
   account in full and it is determined to be practicable.

   428.2. At least ten (10) working days prior to terminating water and sewer
   services to the premises, WASA shall send a notice to the tenant(s) in
   accordance with ยง 425.2.

   428.3. Once it is determined that the tenants will be billed directly for
   water and sewer charges, WASA will read the meter on service at the affected
   address and render a final bill to the owner or the agent for the owner.

   428.4. If water and sewer charges incurred by the tenant(s) remain unpaid for
   more than thirty (30) days after the rendering of a bill for the charges,
   penalties and interest shall be applied to the tenant&#8217;s outstanding
   charges, and water and sewer services may be terminated.

   428.5. If water and sewer service charges billed directly to the tenant or
   tenants are unpaid and result in the termination of services, the tenant or
   tenants shall be required to pay all delinquent charges, penalties, interest
   and fees incurred during the period they received bills.

   428.6. If service has been terminated due to a delinquent tenant account,
   services shall not be restored until all charges, penalties, interest and fees
   for the property are paid in full.
