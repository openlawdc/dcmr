4107.1. The IAC Incentive Discount shall not exceed the maximum allowable IAC
   Incentive Discount percentage, which shall be four percent (4%) of the
   otherwise chargeable Clean Rivers Impervious Area Charge in the first year of
   the IAC Discount program, which may change in subsequent years subject to DC
   Water’s budget appropriations.

   4107.2. The maximum allowable IAC Incentive Discount percentage is subject to
   change annually based on DC Water’s budget appropriations.

   4107.3. The IAC Incentive Discount shall be calculated as follows:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   DDOE will send DC Water the DDOE approved maximum volume of stormwater runoff
   retained (in Equivalent Residential Units (ERUs)) by an approved and eligible
   BMP(s) during a one and two tenths inch (1.2 in.) rainfall event;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Multiply the number of ERUs of step “(a)”  by the maximum allowable
   discount percentage; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Multiply the step “(b)” result by the IAC per ERU specified in § 4101 of
   this chapter.

   4107.4. The calculated IAC Incentive Discount shall be applied to each Clean
   Rivers Impervious Area Charge billed.

   4107.5. The IAC Incentive Discount will appear on the customer’s DC Water
   bill beginning with the billing period that follows DC Water’s receipt and
   processing of DDOE’s approved maximum volume of stormwater runoff retained
   (in ERUs).  For customers billed on a semi-annual basis, the discount will
   appear on their next bill, which is normally in March and September.
