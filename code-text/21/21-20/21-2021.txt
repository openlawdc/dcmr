                                  DC REGULATIONS

RECYCLING REQUIREMENTS FOR PREMISES NOT ELIGIBLE FOR DPW COLLECTION SERVICES (§
21-2021)

2021.2. Each owner of a commercial property shall be responsible for the
   separate removal of recyclable material by a registered recycling hauler or
   pursuant to an approved self-implementation plan.  The owner may provide
   through a lease agreement for an occupant to be responsible for its own solid
   waste removal, in which case the occupant shall also be responsible for the
   separate removal of recylable material, unless otherwise provided for in the
   lease agreement. Notwithstanding the existence of such a lease agreement, the
   owner is responsible for complying with these regulations except where the
   Director determines that there are circumstances that warrant holding an
   occupant liable for compliance.  The Director may issue a notice of violation
   to an occupant or to the owner.

   2021.3. Each owner of commercial property shall, at least once a year, notify
   any tenants or occupants of the property of the legal requirement that certain
   materials be separated for recycling, the types of materials to be separated,
   how and where recyclables shall be taken in order to be collected for
   recycling, and the name and contact information of any recycling coordinator
   for the property.

   2021.4. Each owner of commercial property shall post and maintain at least one
   (1) sign where solid waste is collected or stored that sets forth what
   materials are required to be source separated and states the collection
   procedures for such materials, and shall post at least one (1) sign at
   containers where recyclables are collected stating what materials may properly
   be placed in them.  The owner may provide through the lease agreement that an
   occupant shall also be responsible for posting and maintaining such signs, in
   which case the occupant shall also be responsible for meeting the requirements
   of this subsection.  Notwithstanding the existence of such a lease agreement,
   the owner is responsible for complying with this regulation except where the
   Director determines that there are circumstances that warrant holding an
   occupant liable for compliance.  The Director may issue a notice of violation
   to an occupant or to the owner.
