HAULING (ยง 21-2053)

2053.1. A recycling hauler shall not simultaneously transport recyclables
   along with other materials for disposal in the same vehicle at the same time
   except pursuant to a written waiver of this requirement.

   if the hauler demonstrates to the Director that the recyclables will be
   transported in a vehicle that does not compress or compact its contents.  The
   hauler shall also demonstrate that the method used for simultaneously
   transporting the materials ensures that recyclables will not be commingled
   with non-recyclable materials and that the recyclables will not be disposed of
   in any way other than by recycling.

   2053.3. The Director may revoke a written waiver if the Director finds that
   the conditions for receiving a waiver are not being met.
