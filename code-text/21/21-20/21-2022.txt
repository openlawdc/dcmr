                                  DC REGULATIONS

SEPARATION OF RECYCLABLE MATERIAL AT COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES (ยง 21-2022)

2022.1. Each owner and each occupant of a commercial property shall, at a
   minimum, separate for recycling paper, paperboard, cardboard, and clean and
   rinsed metal, glass and plastic containers.  The materials that are separated
   for recycling shall be stored in bins, dumpsters, or other containers that are
   not used for the simultaneous storage of solid waste and recyclable materials.
    The owner may provide through a lease agreement for an occupant to be
   responsible for separating these materials for recycling in which case the
   occupant shall also be responsible for meeting the requirements of this
   subsection.  Notwithstanding the existence of such a lease agreement, the
   owner is responsible for complying with this regulation except where the
   Director determines that there are circumstances that warrant holding the
   occupant liable for compliance.  The Director may issue a notice of violation
   to the occupant or to the owner.

   2022.2. REPEALED

   2022.3. Recyclable material shall be collected at least twice per month unless
   fewer collections have been previously approved in writing by the Director.

   2022.4. A sufficient number of containers shall be provided to store such
   recyclables which may accumulate on the premises during the intervals between
   collections.

   2022.5. All containers for recyclables shall be kept clean and in good repair.
