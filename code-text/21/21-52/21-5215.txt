                                  DC REGULATIONS

SEVERANCE PAY NOT PURSUANT TO A REDUCTION IN FORCE (ยง 21-5215)

5215.1. In accordance with criteria adopted by the Board of Directors,
   severance pay may be authorized by the General Manager to Authority employees
   who are voluntarily or involuntarily separated from Authority employment when
   the General Manager determines that it is in the Authority&#8217;s best
   interest. Severance pay under this Section applies to nonunion full-time
   employees in regular and at-will positions who were not separated from
   employment as part of a reduction in force.

   5215.2. The General Manager will determine the schedule and amounts to be paid
   to employees pursuant to the terms of this section. When the General Manager
   has determined that severance pay will be offered to employees, the General
   Manager may authorize a continuation of the employee&#8217;s medical and life
   insurance coverage. The Authority&#8217;s contribution to premiums will be
   paid for the same period as severance pay.

   5215.3. The General Manager may provide employees involuntarily separated from
   Authority employment with out-placement assistance and/or other benefits, if
   the General Manager considers that it is in the best interest of the
   Authority.
