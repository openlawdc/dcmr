   the District, the property owner shall be notified and shall be responsible
   for having the leak repaired by a registered master plumber at the
   owner&#8217;s expense.

   111.4. If a leaking water pipe is a public nuisance or hazard, or the leak is
   damaging property, the water supply to the premises will be shut-off
   immediately to abate the problem and shall remain shut-off until repairs are
   made.

   111.5. If the property line and the building line are the same, and the leak
