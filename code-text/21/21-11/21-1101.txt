   1101.3 	The Director may remove a designated use, establish a partial use, or
   establish sub-categories of a use for a particular surface water segment or
   body if a use attainability analysis can demonstrate that attaining the
   designated use is not feasible because:
   
   
   
   (a)	Naturally occurring pollutant concentrations prevent the attainment of the
   use;
   
   
   
   (b)	Natural, ephemeral, intermittent or low flow conditions or water levels
   prevent the attainment of the use, unless these conditions may be compensated
   for by the discharge of sufficient volume of effluent discharges without
   violating the Districtâ€™s water conservation requirements to enable uses to
   be met;
   
   
   
   (c) 	Human caused conditions or sources of pollution prevent the attainment of
   the use and cannot be remedied or would cause more environmental damage to
   correct than to leave in place;
   
   
   
   (d) 	Dams, diversions or other types of hydrologic modifications preclude the
   attainment of the use, and it is not feasible to restore the waterbody to its
   original condition or, to operate the modification in a way that would result
   in the attainment of the use;
   
   
   
   (e) 	Physical conditions related to the natural features of the waterbody,
   such as the lack of proper substrate, cover, flow, depth, pools, riffles, and
   the like unrelated to water quality, preclude attainment of aquatic life
   protection uses; or
   
   
   
   (f)	Controls more stringent than those required by sections 301(b) and 306 of
   the federal Clean Water Act would result in substantial and widespread
   economic and social impact.

   1101.4. A designated use specified in section 1101 may not be removed, and a
   partial use that involves the removal of the designated use, may not be
   established if:
   
   
   
   (a)	The use is actually attained in the surface water segment or body on or
   after November 28, 1975, unless a use requiring more stringent criteria is
   added; or
   
   
   
   (b)	The uses will be attained by implementing effluent limits required under
   sections 301(b) and 306 of the federal Clean Water Act and by implementing
   cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source
   control.

   1101.5. If a permittee requests the Director to conduct a use attainability
   analysis and provides a reasonable basis for the need, the Director shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	Conduct a public meeting in the watershed of the affected segment or
   waterbody to inform the public of the nature of the use change requested and
   the basis of the request, and solicit the opinions and views of the public
   prior to determining whether to conduct a use attainability analysis;
   
   
   
   (b)	Inform the permittee and the public of the decision;
   
   
   
   (c)	Inform the permittee of the approximate costs of the analysis and the
   schedule. The permittee shall pay the costs of performing the analysis, in the
   amount specified by the Director;
   
   
   
   (d)	Not allow the permittee to perform the analysis;
   
   
   
   (e)	Form an advisory group of citizens and affected parties who will meet
   periodically during the course of the study;
   
   
   
   (f)	Hold a public hearing concerning the preliminary finding of the use
   attainability analysis prior to concluding the study;
   
   
   
   (g)	Submit the analysis to the United States Environmental Protection Agency
   (EPA) for review and approval, if the Director determines that a modification
   or change in the uses of the segment or waterbody is justified; and
   
   
   
   (h)	Modify or remove the use in accordance with federal and District
   procedures for revising water quality standards upon receipt of approval by
   the EPA.
