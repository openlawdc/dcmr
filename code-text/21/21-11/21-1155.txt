                                  DC REGULATIONS

GROUND WATER STANDARDS (§ 21-1155)

1155.1. For the protection of the designated use of the ground water and the
   hydrologically connected water bodies, narrative and numerical criteria,
   enforcement standards and early warning values for each ground water class
   shall be provided in this section in order to establish upper contaminant
   levels that shall not be exceeded.

   1155.2. The following narrative criteria shall apply to all ground waters of
   the District:
   
   
   
   (a)	All ground waters shall at all places and at all times be free from
   pollution in the form of oil, carcinogens, toxicants, and other substances in
   concentrations which might present a health hazard or render the ground water
   unusable; and
   
   
   
   (b)	All ground waters shall at all places and at all times be free from
   domestic, industrial, agricultural, or other man-induced non-thermal
   components of discharges in concentrations which, alone or in combination with
   other substances or components of discharges:
   
   
   
   (1)	Are harmful to plants, animals or other organisms;
   
   
   
   (2)	Are carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, or toxic in toxic amounts to
   human beings;
   
   
   
   (3)	Are acutely toxic to biological species of the aquatic community within
   surface waters affected by the ground water at the point of contact with
   surface waters;
   
   
   
   (4)	Pose a serious danger to the public health, safety or welfare;
   
   
   
   (6)	Create or constitute a nuisance; or
   
   
   
   (7)	Impair the reasonable and beneficial use of adjacent waters within and
   outside the District.

   1155.3. Numerical criteria for Class G1 ground waters shall be the most
   restrictive and are as follows:

   1155.4. For the purposes of §§ 1150 through 1158 of this chapter, the
   enforcement standard shall be the value assigned to any contaminant, which if
   exceeded, may result in the Director initiating enforcement action.

   1155.5. Except as specified in § 1155.6, the enforcement standards shall be
   established based on the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	For Class G1, where a criterion is established, the enforcement standard
   shall be the criterion if the criterion is not exceeded in the background
   water quality;
   
   
   
   (b)	For Class G1, if a criterion is established and exceeded in the background
   water quality, the enforcement standard shall be the background concentration;
   
   
   
   (c)	When a criterion is not established for a Class G1 ground water, the
   enforcement standard shall be based on the best available scientific knowledge
   including, but not limited to, the background water quality, the use of U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency water quality criteria and Health Advisories,
   other states water quality criteria, and risk assessment calculations. The
   value utilized will depend on technological and economic factors;
   
   
   
   (d)	When a specific activity which does or may contaminate ground water is
   being regulated by the Director and a criterion is not established, the
   enforcement standard may be established by the Director through, but not
   limited to, a waste discharge permit or other permit, order or a memorandum of
   understanding with other regulating agencies; and
   
   
   
   (e)	For a Class G2 or Class G3 ground water, the enforcement standard shall be
   based on the best available scientific knowledge including, but not limited
   to, the background water quality, the use of U.S. Environmental Protection
   Agency water quality criteria and Health Advisories, other states water
   quality criteria, and risk assessment calculations. The value utilized will
   depend on the class of ground water, and technological and economic factors.

   1155.6. A request for variation from the enforcement standards of § 1155.5
   for any class of ground water can be made to the Director. The request, by the
   responsible party, shall be based on both the technological and economic
   analyses. The responsible party shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
   Director that cleanup to the enforcement standard is both technologically and
   economically infeasible. The request shall propose an alternate cleanup level.

   1155.7. Early Warning Values (&#8220;EWV&#8221;) shall be established to
   protect ground waters from contamination and to avoid costly remediation by
   providing for early detection of increasing contaminant concentrations before
   the criteria or enforcement standards are exceeded.

   1155.8. EWV&#8217;s shall be applicable to facilities or activities with a
   potential to contaminate ground water and which are required to monitor the
   impact of their activities on ground water quality.

   1155.9. Whenever a criterion or an enforcement standard is set above
   background level, an EWV or trend analysis shall be utilized.
   
   
   
   1155.10 Early Warning Values shall be determined by one of the following
   items:
   
   
   
   (a)	When the regulated substance is not found in the background water quality
   or is present in levels lower than the criterion or the enforcement standard
   then the EWV shall be as follows:
   
   
   
   (1)	Practical quantitation limit for all synthetic constituents for which no
   natural source exists;
   
   
   
   (2)	Twenty percent (20%) of the criterion or enforcement standard for
   substances of health concern;
   
   
   
   (3)	Fifty percent (50%) of the criterion or enforcement standard for
   substances of public welfare concern; or
   
   
   
   (4)	EWV for specific criteria are according to § 1155.3; or
   
   
   
   (b)	When the regulated substance is found in the background water quality in a
   concentration that exceeds the criterion or enforcement standard for that
   substance, then the EWV shall be set between background and the criterion or
   enforcement standard in such a way that increasing or decreasing contaminant
   levels will be detected.

   1155.11. If the permittee or responsible party desire, a trend analysis in
   place of fixed values for EWV&#8217;s may be used. The trend analysis shall
   use a scientifically sound and valid statistical procedure appropriate to the
   discharge and shall provide a ninety-nine percent (99%) level of confidence.
   The design and implementation of the trend analysis shall be the
   responsibility of the permittee and shall be approved by the Director.
   Response levels shall be defined for each trend analysis but at a minimum
   shall include those levels as defined in § 1155.3.

   1155.12. It shall not be considered a violation of §§ 1150 through 1158 of
   this chapter when pollutants are detected in concentrations exceeding an EWV
   unless the following occurs:
   
   
   
   (a)	The pollutant concentrations exceed the numerical criterion of § 1155.3
   and the enforcement standards of § 1155.5; and
   
   
   
   (b)	There is failure to inform the Director or respond as required in §
   1155.13.

   1155.13. The following procedures shall apply when a substance(s) is detected
   at the point of compliance and an EWV is attained or exceeded, or a net change
   in concentration is detected through an approved trend analysis:
   
   
   
   (a)	The permittee or responsible party shall notify the Director, in writing,
   within thirty (30) days; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Upon receiving notification, the Director may require the permittee or
   responsible party to perform one of the following:
   
   
   
   (1)	No action;
   
   
   
   (2)	Resample wells to verify results;
   
   
   
   (3)	Revise the monitoring plan including increased monitoring; or
   
   
   
   (4)	Complete a report documenting the extent of contamination, contamination
   sources and discuss alternative methods of operation.
