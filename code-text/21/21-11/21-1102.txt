                                  DC REGULATIONS

ANTIDEGRADATION POLICY (§ 21-1102)

1102.1. TIER I:  Existing instream water uses and the level of water quality
   necessary to protect the existing uses shall be maintained and protected.

   1102.2. TIER II:  If the water quality of the surface waters of the District
   exceeds the water quality criteria necessary to sustain the existing uses,
   those waters shall be maintained at that quality. The water quality will not
   be allowed to degrade unless the District finds, after full satisfaction of
   the inter-governmental coordination and public participation of the
   District’s continuing planning process as required in 40 CFR Part 130, that
   allowing lower water quality is necessary to accommodate important economic or
   social development in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing
   the degradation to lower water quality, the District shall ensure water
   quality adequate to protect existing uses fully. Further, the District shall
   ensure that the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and
   existing point sources and all cost effective and reasonable best management
   practices for nonpoint source control.

   1102.3. TIER III: Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding national
   resource, such as waters of the national and District parks and wildlife
   refuges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological significance,
   those waters shall be designated Outstanding National Resource Waters (ONRW)
   and the water quality in the ONRW shall be maintained, protected and
   designated as below:
   
   
   
   (a)	New point and nonpoint source discharges, treated or otherwise, shall be
   prohibited in these segments;
   
   
   
   (b)	Increases in loadings or new pollutants from existing point and nonpoint
   source discharges shall be prohibited in these segments;
   
   
   
   (c)	Short-term degradation of the water quality shall be permitted after the
   permittee provides an opportunity for public participation; and submits to the
   Department a report that describes the matter on which the public was
   consulted; summarizes the views, significant comments, criticisms and
   suggestions of the public and other local and federal government agencies; and
   sets forth the specific responses in terms of modifications of the proposed
   action or an explanation for rejection of proposals made by the public and
   other local and federal government agencies. However, all practical means of
   minimizing the degradation shall be implemented; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Designation of ONRWs shall be adopted after full satisfaction of the
   intergovernmental coordination of the District&#8217;s agencies and public
   participation provisions of the District’s continuing planning process as
   required in 40 CFR Part 130.

   1102.4. SPECIAL WATERS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA (SWDC):  Any segment or
   segments of the surface waters of the District that are of water quality
   better than needed for the current use or have scenic or aesthetic importance
   shall be designated as Special Waters of the District of Columbia (SWDC). The
   water quality in SWDC designated segments of the District&#8217;s surface
   waters shall be maintained at or above the current level by implementing the
   following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Existing nonpoint source discharges, storm water discharges and storm
   sewer discharges to SWDC segments shall be controlled through implementation
   of best management practices and regulatory programs;
   
   
   
   (b)	Construction or development projects, such as roads, bridges, and bank
   stabilization of the streams in which a SWDC designated segment is located,
   which may lead to pollution of the water, shall be permitted on a case-by-case
   basis to ensure that there are no long-term adverse water quality effects and
   that no impairment of the designated uses of the segment occurs; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Short term degradation of water quality in a SWDC segment due to
   construction projects may be permitted provided that prior notice is given to
   the public and other local and federal government agencies, and provided that
   the builder of the construction project submits a report to the Department
   which summarizes the views, significant comments, criticisms and suggestions
   of the public and other local and federal government agencies; and sets forth
   the specific responses in terms of modifications of the proposed action or an
   explanation for rejection of proposals made by the public and other local and
   federal government agencies.

   1102.5. The following waters of the District shall be designated as SWDC
   segments:
   
   
   
   (a)	Rock Creek and its tributaries, and
   
   
   
   (b)	Battery Kemble Creek and its tributaries.
