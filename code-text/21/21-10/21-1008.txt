                                  DC REGULATIONS

CARRYOUT BAG CREDIT PROGRAM (§ 21-1008)

If a retail establishment participates in the voluntary Carryout Bag Credit
Program, the establishment may retain an additional one cent ($0.01), for a
total of two cents ($0.02), from each fee of five cents ($0.05) charged pursuant
to Section 1001. The remaining three cents ($0.03) of each fee of five cents
($0.05) charged pursuant to Section 1001, shall be remitted to the Office of Tax
and Revenue.





The voluntary Carryout Bag Credit Program means a program under which the retail
establishment:





	Credits the customer at least five cents ($0.05) for each carryout bag

provided by the customer for packaging his or her purchases, regardless of
whether the bag is paper, plastic, or reusable;







	Prominently advertises its participation in, and the substance of, the

Carryout Bag Credit Program at each of its checkout registers;







	Reflects the total credit amount on the receipt of the customer who

provides his or her own bag or bags; and



(d)	Registers its participation in the Carryout Bag Credit Program with the
District Department of the Environment.







A retail establishment shall not be required, as a prerequisite to participating
in the Carryout Bag Credit Program, to provide a credit to a customer for any
portion of the customer’s purchase for which the customer declines the use of
a carryout bag.





The retail establishment shall credit a customer a total number of five cent
($0.05) credits that reasonably relate the amount of goods purchased to the
number of carryout bags reasonably required to carry the purchased goods.





A credit provided to a customer pursuant to a Carryout Bag Credit Program shall
not reduce the amount of fees due to the Office of Tax and Revenue under
Sections 1007.1 and 1008.1.







A retail establishment that withdraws from the Carryout Bag Credit Program shall
provide notice to the District Department of the Environment of its withdrawal
at least ten (10) business days before its withdrawal.
