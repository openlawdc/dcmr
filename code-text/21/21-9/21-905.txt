   	EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: The Building Code referred to in this section has been
   superseded by D.C. Law 6-216, Construction Codes Approval and Amendments Act
   of 1986, effective March 21, 1987. Section 12 of D.C. Law 6-216 provides that
   the construction regulations existing prior to March 21, 1987, remain in
   effect for projects having reached specified stages of completion. D.C. Law
   6-216 adopted the 1984 National BOCA Codes, and the 1985 D.C. Supplement to
   the National BOCA Codes. Effective November 27, 1992 (39 DCR 8665), the 1984
   BOCA Codes, and the 1985 D.C. Supplement to the National BOCA Codes were
   superseded by the adoption of the 1990 BOCA Codes, and the 1992 D.C.
   Supplement to the BOCA Codes.
