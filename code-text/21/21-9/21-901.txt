                                  DC REGULATIONS

SEPTIC TANK AND SUBSOIL DISPOSAL SYSTEMS (§ 21-901)

901.1. Where no public sewer was, within a reasonable time, reasonably
   available while a septic tank was legitimately constructed, the septic tank
   may continue to be used so long as the use and the maintenance of the tank
   complies with both the D.C. Plumbing Code and the Wastewater System Regulation
   Amendment Act of 1985, unless the Health Officer finds the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	That the local soil conditions will prevent the sanitary operation of the
   system;
   
   
   
   (b)	That the water supply is not adequate to permit the sanitary operation of
   the system;
   
   
   
   (c)	That the operation of the system will pollute a stream, pond, lake, or
   other body of water or contaminate a water supply, pool, or bathing place; or
   
   
   
   (d)	That the operation of the system will endanger the public health or
   otherwise create a nuisance.

   901.2. The use of septic tanks and subsoil sewage disposal systems shall
   comply with both the D.C. Plumbing Code and the Wastewater System Regulation
   Amendment Act of 1985, and other methods of disposal shall not only comply
   with those provisions, but shall also be maintained without endangering the
   public health or otherwise creating a nuisance.

   superseded by D.C. Law 6-216, Construction Codes Approval and Amendments Act
   of 1986, effective March 21, 1987. Section 12 of D.C. Law 6-216 provides that
   the construction regulations existing prior to March 21, 1987, remain in

   BOCA Codes, and the 1985 D.C. Supplement to the National BOCA Codes were
   superseded by the adoption of the 1990 BOCA Codes and the 1992 D.C. Supplement
   to the BOCA Codes.
