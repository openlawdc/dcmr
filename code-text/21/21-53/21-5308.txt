ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (ยง 21-5308)

5308.1. An organizational conflict of interest exists when an offeror or a
   contractor (prime contractor or subcontractor) has:
   
   
   
   (a) 	An unfair competitive advantage in a procurement as the result of access
   to nonpublic information about the procurement or a competing bidder; or
   
   
   
   (b) 	An incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide
   impartial assistance or advice to the Authority.

   5308.2. In an effort to ensure a fair procurement process and protect the
   interest of the Authority, a Contracting Officer will analyze a planned
   procurement to identify actual or potential organizational conflicts of
   interest as early as possible in the procurement process and determine if an
   actual or potential organizational conflict of interest can be effectively
   avoided or mitigated.

   5308.3. A Contracting Officer may reject a bid or proposal if an
   organizational conflict of interest has not been eliminated, avoided or
   mitigated to the satisfaction of the Authority.
