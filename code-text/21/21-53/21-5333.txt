5333.1 	The Authority will review unsolicited proposals and consider the
   feasibility of their implementation. An unsolicited proposal is one which:
   
   
   
   Is innovative or unique;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Is independently originated and developed by the offeror;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Is prepared without the Authority’s supervision;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Includes sufficient detail to permit a determination that the proposed
   product, services or work could benefit Authority’s mission or allow it to
   meet its responsibilities; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Is not an advance proposal for a known or anticipated Authority requirement
   that can be procured by competitive methods.
   
   
   
   5333.2 	Unsolicited proposals may be the basis of a competitive procurement if
   deemed to be in the best interest of the Authority.

   5333.3. An offeror may designate portions of its proposal to be confidential
   if they include proprietary information or contain sensitive personnel
   information.
   
   
   
   5333.4 	An unsolicited proposal shall be returned to an offeror, citing
   reasons, when the proposal:
   
   
   
   Does not meet the criteria in § 5333.1; or
   
   
   
   Is not deemed to be advantageous to the Authority.

   5333.5. Acceptance of an unsolicited proposal may be recommended to the
   General Manager, who may accept it or reject it.
