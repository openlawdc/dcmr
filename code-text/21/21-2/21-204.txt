SEWER STOPPAGES (§ 21-204)

204.1. If there is a complaint regarding a sewer stoppage, the Director shall
   first ascertain if the main sewer is clear. If the main sewer is clear, the
   complaining party shall be so informed.

   204.2. Any stoppage in the main sewer shall be relieved within a reasonable
   period of time.

   204.3. If the main sewer is clear, the complaining party shall, at his or her
   own expense, employ a registered master plumber or sewer cleaner to clear the
   stoppage from the building to the main sewer.

   204.4. A registered master plumber or sewer cleaner employed under §204.3
   shall not excavate in public ways beyond the property line.

   204.5. If the registered master plumber or sewer cleaner finds that the
   stoppage is located between the main sewer and property line, and that it
   cannot be cleared by power rodding or snaking, he or she shall inform the
   Director.

   204.6. If the Director finds that the stoppage is in the building connection
   between the property line and the main sewer, and that the stoppage could not
   have been cleared by power rodding or snaking, the condition shall be
   corrected by the District.

   204.7. If the Director finds that the stoppage is not due to the faulty
   condition of the building sewer connection between the property line and the
   main sewer, the property owner shall pay the D.C. Treasurer the amount of
   expense incurred by the District.

   204.8. All stoppages in public space outside of the property line, whether
   relieved or not, shall be reported to the Director by the registered master
   plumber or sewer cleaner.
