                                  DC REGULATIONS

SEWAGE ALLOWANCES FOR INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL USERS (§ 21-206)

206.1. A commercial or industrial property may be eligible for a sewer
   allowance when the amount of water discharged into the District&#8217;s sewer
   is less than the amount of water it receives from the District&#8217;s water
   distribution system.

   206.2. The following two (2) methods shall be used to determine the extent and
   amount of the sewer allowance:
   
   
   
   (a)	Metered Allowance: A sewer allowance will be granted to industrial and
   commercial users based on the total measured amount of water supplied by the
   District that does not enter the District&#8217;s sewer system; Provided that
   the owner installs the necessary meters or devices, at no cost to the
   District, as indicated in this subsection:
   
   
   
   (1)	A separate meter is installed to measure the amount of water used that
   will not be discharged in the District&#8217;s sewer system;
   
   
   
   (2)	There is a security device that prevents tapping into the water supply;
   and
   
   
   
   (3)	A device is installed that recirculates the water supply or prohibits
   water from being discharged into or entering the District&#8217;s sewer
   system, including runoff and wind-blown water; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Flat Allowance: Commercial and industrial properties that have recycling
   cooling systems will be granted a sewer allowance based on the number of
   gallons of water circulated per minute.

   206.3. The flat allowance shall be subtracted from the sewer service charge
   only during the period May 15th to October 15th of each year.

   206.4. To extend the period for the flat allowance, property owners shall
   submit a written request and justification. The request must be approved by
   the Chief before it can go into effect.

   206.5. Upon receipt of a written request for a sewer allowance, the Chief
   shall conduct an audit of the property to determine whether and the conditions
   under which, the property is eligible for a sewer allowance.

   206.6. Owners of commercial and industrial properties shall be notified in
   writing whether the properties are eligible for a sewer allowance and the
   amount of any sewer allowance.

   206.7. Commercial and industrial property owners shall allow the Bureau access
   to audit water use and to verify that the amount is not being discharged into
   the District&#8217;s sewer system.

   206.8. During any period when the owner or occupant of eligible property fails
   to permit an audit under this section, all privileges associated with the
   sewer allowance shall be forfeited and the charges for sewer service shall be
   based on the full amount of water received by the property from the District
   water supply system.
