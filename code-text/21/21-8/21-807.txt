   807.3. The requirements of this section are not intended to apply to those
   containers which are configured with hydraulically actuated compactor heads
   and plastic containers less than one cubic yard (1 yd.3) in capacity which are
   used for solid waste (refuse) collection service and are rolled to the
   collection vehicle.

   807.4. All slant-refuse bins shall comply with the applicable requirements of

   stable, stationary object so that the bin cannot tip; or
   
   
   
   (b)	The slant-refuse bin shall be completely enclosed within a fence or
