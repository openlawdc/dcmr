PAPER BAGS FOR UNCOMPACTED SOLID WASTE (ยง 21-801)

801.1. Paper bags shall be fabricated from new and unused wet-strength kraft
   paper, wholly extensible or wholly non-extensible or equivalent.

   801.2. All wet-strength paper shall be distinctly marked on the outer surface
   for identification by longitudinal stripes spaced not less than two inches (2
   in.) nor more than ten inches (10 in.) apart across the paper width, and each
   stripe shall be not less than one eighth inch (1/8 in.) in width. No other
   grade of paper used in the bags shall be striped in this manner.

   801.3. For multi-ply bags, the identification marking shall appear on the
   external surface of the bag.

   801.4. The non-extensible paper used to construct single-ply or multi-ply bags
   shall be a nominal basis weight of one hundred pounds (100 lbs.) per five
   hundred (500) sheets, and a minimum basis weight of ninety-five pounds (95
   lbs.) per five hundred (500) sheets. The size of each sheet is twenty-four
   inches by thirty-six inches (24 in. x 36 in.).

   801.5. The extensible or equivalent paper used to construct single-ply or
   multi-ply bags shall have a nominal basis weight of ninety pounds (90 lbs.)
   per five hundred (500) sheets, and a minimum basis of eighty-five and one-half
   pounds (85.5 lbs.) per five hundred (500) sheets. The size of each sheet is
   twenty-four inches by thirty-six inches (24 in. x 36 in.).

   801.6. Minimum tensile energy absorptions for dry and wet extensible or
   equivalent paper used in single and multi-ply bags are set forth in Table I:
