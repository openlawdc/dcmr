   * The capacity or dimension of cans shall not be less than ninety-five percent
   (95%) of the nominal size.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   ** Weight includes cover when finished with items.

   803.2. The basic metal of bodies, bottoms, bands, covers stamped handles, and
   clips shall be of a good grade of sheet steel having the strength, rigidity,
   and quality necessary for the production of hot-dipped galvanized ware
   conforming to these specifications.

   803.3. Top wires and size handles shall be of drawn-steel wire.

   803.4. Rivets shall be of high-grade soft steel.

   803.5. Top-wire shall be full length (not spliced) with ends separated not
   more than one-half inch (1/2 in.) and fully enclosed except where exposed for
   forming ears.

   803.6. Handles and handle clips shall be of ample strength and so attached
   that no permanent deformation shall occur when samples of cans are tested as
   prescribed in §803.14.

   803.7. All cans shall be water tight when tested as prescribed in §803.13.

   803.8. After fabrication and cleaning, each can shall be completely
   zinc-coated by the hot-dip process. The coating shall be smooth, continuous
   and thorough. It shall be free from such imperfections as lumps, slivers,
   blisters, gritty areas, uncoated spots, acid and black spots, dross and flux.

   803.9. As per A-123, §3, the grade of zinc used in the coating shall be at
   least equal to Prime Western and conform to ASTM B6, for zinc metal (slab
   zinc).

   803.10. The weight of coating on the finished cans shall not be less than one
   and one-half ounces per square foot (1.5 oz./ft.2), as determined by the
   method prescribed in §803.16. The weight of the coating is the total amount
   on both sides of the steel sheet, expressed in ounces per square foot (oz.
   /ft.2: total for both sides). The coating shall be sufficiently tight to
   withstand the test prescribed in §803.15.

   803.11. Workmanship shall ensure production of cans free from defects
   impairing their water-tightness, serviceability, or durability. All rivets
   shall be securely set and all welds shall be sound and smooth.

   803.12. Sufficient samples of galvanized ware shall be selected at random from
   each lot of each container produced during the process of manufacture as are
   needed to maintain quality of the product so as to be consistently in
   conformance with these specifications.

   803.13. Samples of containers intended to hold liquid shall be taken at
   random. Each sample selected shall be filled with water and allowed to stand
   for twenty-four (24) hours. To be acceptable under this test, there shall be
   no indications of leakage during this period.

   803.14. Samples taken at random shall be filled with dry sand to half capacity
   and suspended from the handles for a period of five (5) minutes. Measurements
   shall be made before and after test to determine whether any permanent
   deformation of handles or handle clips, or top diameter has occurred.

   803.15. After inspection, the samples selected for tests shall be struck a
   blow with a half pound (1/2 lb.) ball-pein hammer with sufficient force to
   dent the metal. The coating shall be adherent and no peeling shall result.

   803.16. The weight of coating shall be determined by the standard spot test
   method as described in ASTM A-90, Methods of Test for Weight of Coating on
   Zinc Coated (galvanized) Iron or Steel Articles.

   803.17. All approved galvanized metal cans distributed, sold or used for the
   containment of solid waste (refuse) in the District shall contain the
   following printed statement on a pressure sensitive backed label affixed to
   the container in a conspicuous location:
   
   
   
   This container ware meets all requirements of the applicable D.C. Standard
   (D.C.1-1-GI) issued by the Department of Public Works by:                     
      (Name of Manufacturer)

   803.18. The display of the statement of approval on a galvanized metal can
   shall be considered the manufacturer&#8217;s certification that the container
   conforms to the specification and testing procedures prescribed in this
   section. Each galvanized metal can shall have marked on it the name and
   address of the principal place of business of the manufacturer or distributor
   of the can, and a code identifying the date and location of the
   container&#8217;s manufacture and the number issued by the District.
