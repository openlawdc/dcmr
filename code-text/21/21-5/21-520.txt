STORMWATER MANAGEMENT[COLON] PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR MAJOR LAND-DISTURBING
ACTIVITY (§ 21-520)

520.1. A site that undergoes a major land-disturbing activity shall employ
   each Best Management Practice (BMP) and land cover necessary to meet the
   requirements of this section until site redevelopment that follows a
   Department-approved Stormwater Management Plan (SWMP) occurs.

   520.2. A site that undergoes a major land-disturbing activity, except the area
   of a site that is in the existing Public Right of Way (PROW), shall maintain
   the following:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Post-development peak discharge rate for a twenty-four (24) hour, two (2)-year
   frequency storm event at a level that is equal to or less than the storm
   event’s pre-development peak discharge rate unless the site’s discharge:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Flows directly or through the separate sewer system to the main stem of the
   tidal Potomac or Anacostia Rivers, the Washington Channel, or the Chesapeake
   and Ohio Canal;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Does not flow into or through a tributary to those waterbodies that runs above
   ground or that the Department expects to be daylighted to run above ground;
   and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Will not cause erosion of land or transport of sediment.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Post-development peak discharge rate for a twenty-four (24) hour, fifteen
   (15)-year frequency storm event at a level that is equal to or less than the
   storm event’s pre-project peak discharge rate; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Post-development peak discharge rate from a twenty-four (24) hour, one hundred
   (100)-year storm event at a level that is equal to or less than the storm
   event’s pre-project peak discharge rate if the site:
   
   
   
   (1)	Increases the size of Special Flood Hazard Area as delineated on the
   effective Flood Insurance Rate Map; or
   
   
   
   (2)	Meets the following two conditions:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Does not discharge to the sewer system and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Has a post-development peak discharge rate for a one hundred (100)-year storm
   event that will cause flooding to a building.

   520.3. A site that undergoes a major land-disturbing activity shall achieve
   retention of the rainfall from the ninetieth (90th) percentile rainfall event
   for the District of Columbia, measured for a twenty-four (24)-hour rainfall
   event with a seventy-two (72)-hour antecedent dry period (1.2 inch rainfall
   event) by:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Employing each BMP necessary to retain the 1.2 inch Stormwater Retention
   Volume (SWRv), calculated as follows:
   
   
   
   	SWRv = [P × [(RvI × %I) + (RvC × %C) + (RvN × %N)] × SA] × 7.48 /12
   
   SWRv	= 	volume, in gallons, required to be retained
   
   P	= 	90th percentile rainfall event for the District (1.2 inches)
   
   RvI	= 	0.95 (runoff coefficient for impervious cover)
   
   RvC	= 	0.25 (runoff coefficient for compacted cover)
   
   RvN	= 	0.00 (runoff coefficient for natural cover)
   
   	%I 	   = 	post-development percent of site in impervious cover
   
   	%C	   =    	post-development percent of site in compacted cover
   
   	%N	   =    	post-development percent of site in natural cover
   
   	SA	   =	surface area, in square feet, of land-disturbing activity
   
   where the surface area under a BMP shall be calculated as part of the
   impervious cover (%I);
   
   
   
   (b) 	Employing each post-development land cover factored into the SWRv; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Calculating separately and achieving the SWRv, with P equal to 1.2 inches,
   for the portion of land-disturbing activity that is in the existing Public
   Right of Way (PROW), in compliance with the section of this chapter pertaining
   to performance requirements in the existing PROW.

   520.4. A site that undergoes a major land-disturbing activity may achieve the
   1.2 inch SWRv on site or through a combination of on-site retention and
   off-site retention, under the following conditions:
   
   
   
   (a) 	The site shall retain on site a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the 1.2
   inch SWRv, calculated for the entire site, unless the Department approves an
   application for relief from extraordinarily difficult site conditions; and
   
   
   
   (b) 	The site shall use off-site retention for the portion of the SWRv that is
   not retained on site.

   520.5. A site that undergoes a major land-disturbing activity may achieve
   on-site retention by retaining more than the 1.2 inch SWRv for an area of the
   site, subject to the following conditions:
   
   
   
   (a) 	At least fifty percent (50%) of the 1.2 inch SWRv from each Site Drainage
   Area (SDA), unless it drains into the combined sewer system, shall be:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Retained; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Treated to remove eighty percent (80%) of total suspended solids; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The entirety of an area intended for use or storage of motor vehicles shall
   drain to each necessary BMP so that at least fifty percent (50%) of the 1.2
   inch SWRv flowing from that entire area is retained or treated;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Retention in excess of a 1.2 inch SWRv for one area of the site may be applied
   to the volume required for another area of the site;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The requirement for retention of a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the 1.2
   inch SWRv for the entire site shall be achieved, unless the Department
   approves an application for relief from extraordinarily difficult site
   conditions; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Retention of volume greater than that from a 1.7 inch rainfall event,
   calculated using the SWRv equation with a P equal to 1.7 inches, shall not be
   counted toward on-site retention.

   520.6. A major land-disturbing activity may achieve on-site retention by
   directly conveying volume from the regulated site to a shared BMP with
   available retention capacity.
