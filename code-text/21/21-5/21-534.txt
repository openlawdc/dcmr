   shall be eligible if a subsequent modification of the consent decree ends the
   requirement to maintain that retention capacity; or
   
   
   
   (B)	Compliance with a Watershed Implementation Plan established under a Total
   Maximum Daily Load for the Chesapeake Bay.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   An as-built Stormwater Management Plan (SWMP) shall document the design,
   installation, and operation of the BMP or land cover in sufficient detail for
   the Department to determine its retention capacity in compliance with the
   specifications and calculations in the Department’s Stormwater Management
   Guidebook (SWMG);
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   A Department inspection shall be successfully completed within six (6) months
