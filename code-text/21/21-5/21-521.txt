                                  DC REGULATIONS

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT[COLON] PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR MAJOR LAND-DISTURBING
ACTIVITY CONSISTING OF BRIDGE, ROADWAY, AND STREETSCAPE PROJECTS IN THE EXISTING
PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY (§ 21-521)

521.1. This section applies only to the portion of a major regulated project
   that consists entirely of bridge, roadway, streetscape, or railway work:
   
   
   
   (a) 	In the existing Public Right of Way (PROW); or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   In the existing PROW and in the public space associated with the PROW.

   521.2. A project in the existing PROW may comply with a requirement in this
   chapter to retain a Stormwater Retention Volume (SWRv) by:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Retaining fifty percent (50%) of the SWRv on site and using off-site retention
   for the remaining volume;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Achieving the SWRv; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Retaining on site the SWRv to the Maximum Extent Practicable (MEP), after
   proving that each opportunity for installing retention capacity has been
   exhausted in compliance with the MEP process for existing PROW detailed in the
   Department’s Stormwater Management Guidebook (SWMG).

   521.3. A project in the existing PROW shall:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Prioritize, to the MEP, the management of stormwater from the roadway,
   including stormwater draining from roadway beyond the area of land-disturbing
   activity; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Not be required to install a Best Management Practice (BMP) or landcover:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   That provides retention capacity greater than that required to achieve the
   SWRv that is calculated for the area of land-disturbing activity; or
   
   
   
   (2)	That is outside the area of land-disturbing activity.

   521.4. An existing PROW project on an Anacostia Waterfront Development Zone
   (AWDZ) site may comply with a requirement in this chapter to achieve a Water
   Quality Treatment Volume (WQTv) by:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Achieving the WQTv; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Achieving the WQTv to the MEP, after proving that each opportunity for
   installing retention and treatment capacity has been exhausted in compliance
   with the MEP process for existing PROW detailed in the SWMG.

   521.5. A project in the existing PROW that elects to comply with the SWMG’s
   MEP process for maximizing retention or treatment shall provide the following
   information demonstrating technical infeasibility or environmental harm:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Detailed explanation of each opportunity for on-site installation of a BMP
   that was considered and rejected, and the reasons for each rejection,
   including each opportunity that could be created by reducing roadway width in
   order to create an expanded area for retention of the SWRv or treatment of the
   WQTv between the curb line and private property; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Evidence of site conditions limiting each opportunity for a BMP, including, as
   applicable:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Data on soil and groundwater contamination;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Data from percolation testing;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Documentation of the presence of utilities requiring impermeable protection or
   a setback;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Documentation of structural requirements that would not be satisfied by a BMP;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Evidence of the applicability of a statute, regulation, court order,
   pre-existing covenant, or other restriction having the force of law; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Evidence of a District-approved use for the safe and effective transport of
   goods or people

   521.6. A major regulated project in the existing PROW may achieve on-site
   retention by retaining more than the 1.2 inch SWRv for an area of the site or
   for an area that drains to the site, subject to the following conditions:
   
   
   
   (a) 	At least fifty percent (50%) of the 1.2 inch SWRv from each Site Drainage
   Area (SDA), unless it drains into the combined sewer system, shall be:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Retained; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Treated to remove eighty percent (80%) of total suspended solids to the MEP;
   and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The entirety of an area intended for use or storage of motor vehicles shall
   drain to each necessary BMP so that at least fifty percent (50%) of the 1.2
   inch SWRv flowing from that entire area is retained or treated;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Retention in excess of a 1.2 inch SWRv for one area of the site or an area
   that drains to the site may be applied to the volume required for another area
   of the site;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The requirement for retention of a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the 1.2
   inch SWRv for the entire site shall be achieved, unless the project achieves
   retention of the SWRv to the MEP; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Retention of volume greater than that from a 1.7 inch rainfall event,
   calculated using the SWRv equation with a P equal to 1.7 inches, shall not be
   counted toward on-site retention.

   521.7. If a project in the existing PROW that is retaining the SWRv to the MEP
   is not able to achieve retention of fifty percent (50%) of the SWRv for the
   entirety of an area intended for use or storage of motor vehicles, the
   Department may waive a requirement to provide treatment for that volume if the
   Department:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Determines that a treatment BMP would displace or reduce the size of retention
   capacity to be installed; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Concludes that the displaced or reduced retention capacity would be as
   protective or more protective for District waterbodies than the alternative
   treatment BMP.

   521.8. An existing PROW project that is retaining the SWRv or the WQTv to the
   MEP shall not be required to use off-site retention for the difference between
   the required volume and the achieved volume.
