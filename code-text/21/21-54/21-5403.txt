21-5403)

5403.1. The General Manager may utilize all reasonable means to identify

   necessary to install backflow preventers, the General Manager shall give the
   Owner of the property identified written notification that the following will
   be required:
   
   
   
   (a)	Installation of the number and type of backflow preventers determined to
   be necessary by the General Manager, at no cost to WASA, within sixty (60)
   days of the date of the notice;
   
   
   
   (b)	Test and inspect the backflow preventers as directed by WASA, at no cost
   to WASA;

   5403.3. An Owner identified in a notice issued pursuant to § 5403.2 may
   petition the General Manager, in writing, for additional time to install the

   § 5403.2. This petition must be delivered to WASA no later than fifteen (15)
   days after the date of notice issued pursuant to § 5403.2. The General Manger
   may grant the request only upon a finding of good cause shown and shall advise
   the petitioning Owner of his or her decision in writing.

   5403.4. An Owner identified in a notice issued pursuant to § 5403.2 may also
   submit an alternative proposal to eliminate existing or potential cross
   connections. The Owner&#8217;s proposal shall be in writing, certified by a
   professional engineer, registered with the District of Columbia, and must be
   delivered to WASA no later than fifteen (15) days after the date of the notice
   issued pursuant to § 5403.2.

   5403.5. The General Manager shall review the Owner&#8217;s proposal made
   pursuant to § 5403.4, and after consideration of generally accepted
   engineering practices, in his or her sole discretion, either approve or deny,
   in whole or in part, the Owner&#8217;s proposal in writing.

   5403.6. If the Owner&#8217;s proposal made pursuant to § 5403.4 is approved
   in whole or in part, the General Manager shall notify the Owner to:
   
   
   
   (a)	Install the number and type of backflow preventers approved, at no cost to
   WASA, within thirty (30) days of the date of the approval or such other period
   of time determined reasonable by the General Manager, within his or her sole
   discretion;
   
   
   
   (b)	Take any other action determined necessary by the General Manager as a
   result of the approval of the Owner&#8217;s proposal;
   
   
   
   (c)	Test and inspect the alternative backflow preventers as directed by WASA,
   at no cost to WASA;
   
   
   
   (d)	Report the test results to WASA as directed by WASA; and
   
   
   
   (e)	Permit inspection or inspections as required by WASA.

   5403.7. If the Owner&#8217;s proposal made pursuant to § 5403.4 is denied, in
   whole or in part, the Owner shall install the devices required in the §
   5403.2 notice within thirty (30) days from the date of the General
   Manager&#8217;s denial.

   5403.8. An Owner, whose proposal made pursuant to § 5403.4 is denied in whole
   or in part, may also petition the General Manager for additional time to
   install the required devices. This petition must be delivered to WASA no later
   than fifteen (15) days after the date of the General Manager&#8217;s notice of
   denial. The General Manger may grant or deny the Owner&#8217;s request within
   the General Manager&#8217;s sole discretion and shall advise the petitioning
   Owner of his or her decision in writing.
