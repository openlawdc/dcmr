                                  DC REGULATIONS

POLITICAL AFFILIATION GUIDELINES (§ 4-515)

515.1. An employer, other than a political organization, shall not discharge,
   refuse to hire, or otherwise discriminate against an employee with respect to
   employment because of the employee’s present or past political affiliation
   or lack of political affiliation.

   515.2. Mere membership in a political party having unlawful goals shall not
   suffice to justify discrimination in employment unless that prohibition is
   required by federal or District law.

   515.3. An employer shall not retaliate against an employee for failure to vote
   for a designated candidate. This shall not prevent an employer or employee
   from expressing support for any candidate unless prohibited under federal or
   District civil service laws.

   515.4. An employer shall not require employees to contribute to fundraising
   campaigns of any political party or candidate or to provide any type of
   support for any political party or candidate.
