                                  DC REGULATIONS

PERSONAL APPEARANCE GUIDELINES (ยง 4-513)

513.1. It shall be considered a violation of Title I of the Act to
   discriminate against any individual on the basis of outward appearance for
   purposes of recruitment, hiring, or promotion. However, an employer may
   prescribe standards of appearance or dress for personnel which serve a
   reasonable business purpose; for example, to identify its employees to the
   public by means of a distinctive uniform, or to maintain a neat and clean
   appearance.
   
   
   
   513. 2	An employer may also prescribe standards of appearance or dress for
   personnel in order to prevent a danger to the health, welfare, or safety of
   employees or customers; for example, requiring head or hand coverings in food
   service jobs, or prohibiting loose items of clothing in jobs where the items
   become caught in machinery.

   513.3. Characteristics such as hair or dress style may be symbolic of race,
   national origin, or religion, and action to limit or prevent their use shall
   constitute a form of discrimination, unless the employer can show a reasonable
   business purpose.
