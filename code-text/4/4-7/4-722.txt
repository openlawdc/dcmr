CLASS ACTIONS (§ 4-722)

722.1. A complaint containing a request for class certification may be filed
   either by an individual complainant or by an organization. Upon receipt of a
   notarized class action complaint, the Office shall within fifteen (15) days
   serve on the respondent a notice of the complaint and a copy of the complaint.
    The respondent shall, within ten (10) days of the receipt of the notice, file
   a written answer to the request for class certification.

   722.2. Within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of a notarized class action
   complaint, the Director shall certify the class only if all of the following
   are satisfied:
   
   
   
   (a)	The class is so numerous that joinder of all injured persons is
   impracticable;
   
   
   
   (b)	Common questions of law and fact exist as to the injured persons;
   
   
   
   (c)	Claims or defenses of the named complainant(s) are typical of the claims
   or defenses of the class members;
   
   
   
   (d)	The named complainant(s) will fairly and adequately represent and protect
   the interests of the class; and
   
   
   
   (e)	The party opposing the class acted on grounds applicable to the class.

   722.3. The decision of the Director to certify a class shall be served on the
   complainant and the respondent in writing.  When the Director denies
   certification of a class, the complaint shall be considered as an individual
   action.  The time limitations in § 712 shall begin on the date that the
   parties receive notification of the Director’s decision to certify or to
   deny certification of a class.

   722.4. The time limits in § 712 may be adjusted at the discretion of the
   Director for a complaint certified as a class action.
