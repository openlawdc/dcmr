   1209.3. Consultation pursuant to § 1209.2 requires that the LA Director
   notify the Coalition of activities that would significantly impact the
   implementation of the Act with sufficient notice so as to allow the Coalition
   to provide meaningful input, and give reasonable consideration to the
   Coalition’s input, which may, where appropriate, lead to changes or
   modifications in decisions.
