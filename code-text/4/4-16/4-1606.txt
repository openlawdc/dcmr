                                  DC REGULATIONS

ENTITLEMENTS-FAMILY LEAVE (§ 4-1606)

1606.1. An employee shall be entitled to a total of sixteen (16) workweeks of
   family leave
   
   	        during any twenty-four (24)-month period for:
   
   	        (a)        The birth of a child of the employee;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster
   
   	care;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The placement of a child with the employee, if the employee permanently
   
   	assumes and discharges parental responsibility for the child; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The care of a family member of the employee who has a serious
   
   	health condition.

   1606.2. The entitlement to family leave shall expire twelve (12) months after
   the birth of the child or placement of the child with the employee.

   1606.3. In the case of care for a family member who has a serious health
   condition, the family leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced
   schedule basis when medically necessary.

   1606.4. Upon agreement between the employer and the employee, family leave for
   the birth, adoption, or foster care or other placement of a child may be taken
   on a reduced leave schedule, during which the sixteen (16) workweeks of family
   leave may be taken over a period not to exceed twenty-four (24) consecutive
   workweeks.

   1606.5. With respect to joint employers, both employers must agree to the
   reduced schedule in order for the employee to be eligible for the reduced
   leave schedule.

   1606.6. Nothing in this section shall require an employer to provide paid
   medical leave.

   1606.7. Should an employee wish to use paid medical, sick, vacation, personal,
   or compensatory leave which the employee has accrued, the employee may use
   such paid leave, provided that it otherwise meets the employer’s
   requirements for the taking of such paid leave. Any paid medical, sick,
   vacation, personal, or compensatory leave provided by an employer that the
   employee elects to use for family leave under this chapter shall count against
   the sixteen (16) workweeks of allowable family leave provided pursuant to the
   DCFMLA.

   1606.8. If an employer has a program that allows an employee to use the paid
   leave of another employee under certain conditions (commonly referred to as a
   leave bank), and the conditions for the employee’s use of the leave bank
   have been met, the employee may use the paid leave as family leave and the
   leave shall count against the sixteen (16) workweeks of family leave provided
   in this chapter.
   
   
   
   1606.9            If two (2) family members are employees of the same
   employer:
   
   
   
   	(a)	The employer may limit to sixteen (16) workweeks during a twenty-four
   (24)-month period the aggregate number of family leave workweeks to which the
   family members are entitled; and
   
   
   
   (b)    	The employer may limit to four (4) workweeks during a twenty- four
   (24)-month period the aggregate number of family leave workweeks to which the
   family members are entitled to take simultaneously.

   1606.10. For the purposes of § 1606.9, the term “same employer” includes
   an office,
   
          division, subdivision, agency, or other organizational section of an
   
   	employer in which both employees have the same or interrelated duties
   
   	and the absence of both employees would unduly disrupt the 	conduct of the
   	employer&#8217;s business.

   1606.11. The limitation on the aggregate number of family leave workweeks to
   
   	       which the family members are entitled shall apply only if the family
   
          members seek to take leave for the same underlying reason, for example,
   
          care for the same family member or due to the birth of the same child.
   
   
   
   1606.12   	Information that an employee gives to an employer regarding a
   family relationship, pursuant to which the employee seeks to take family leave
   under this section, shall be used only to make a decision in regard to the
   provisions of this chapter. An employer shall keep any information regarding
   the family relationship confidential.
