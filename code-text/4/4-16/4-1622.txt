INVESTIGATION (§ 4-1622)

1622.1. An aggrieved person (a “complainant”) shall file a written
   complaint with OHR alleging a violation of the DCFMLA within one (1) year
   after the occurrence or the discovery of the action or occurrence that the
   person alleges to be a violation.

   1622.2. OHR shall serve a copy of the complaint filed pursuant to § 1622.1 on
   the employer who is alleged to have violated the DCFMLA (the
   “respondent”).  OHR shall serve the copy of the complaint by certified
   mail within five (5) business days after the date the complaint is filed.

   1622.3. The respondent shall file a response with OHR within fifteen (15)
   business days after the respondent receives the complaint.
   
   
   
   1622.4 	OHR shall investigate the complaint and, where necessary, conduct a
   hearing to decide if a violation of the DCFMLA occurred.
   
   
   
   1622.5 	OHR may accept statements of evidence with respect to the allegations
   made in the complaint and the response of the employer. OHR shall use such
   means as it considers suitable to conduct an investigation, including, but not
   limited to, written or verbal inquiry, field visits, fact-finding conferences,
   or other methods or a combination of methods.
   
   
   
   1622.6 	OHR shall complete its investigation within ninety (90) days after it
   commences the investigation or as soon as practicable thereafter.
   
   
   
   1622.7 	OHR shall issue a written determination as to whether probable cause
   exists to believe that a violation of the DCFMLA occurred. All determinations
   shall be supported by substantial evidence.
   
   
   
   1622.8 	The complaint shall be considered dismissed if no probable cause is
   found. The complainant may seek whatever judicial review may be available
   pursuant to section 10(c) of the DCFMLA (D.C. Official Code § 32-509(c)).
   
   
   
   1622.9 	If OHR determines that probable cause exists that a violation of the
   DCFMLA has occurred, it shall serve on the parties a notice indicating this
   determination, together with a Notice of Hearing setting a hearing date on the
   alleged violation.
   
   
   
   1622.10 	OHR shall schedule the hearing to be held within thirty (30) days
   after it serves the Notice of Hearing or as soon as practicable thereafter.
