                                  DC REGULATIONS

CALCULATION OF LEAVE (§ 4-1616)

1616.1. A private employer may choose any of the following methods for
   determining the twenty-four (24)-month period in which the sixteen (16) weeks
   of family leave and sixteen (16) workweeks of medical leave under DCFMLA may
   be taken by an employee:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The calendar year;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Any fixed twelve (12)-month leave year, such as a fiscal year, a
   
   year required by state law, or a year starting on an employee’s anniversary
   date;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The twenty-four (24)-month period measured forward from the date any
   employee’s first DCFMLA leave begins; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The twenty-four (24)-month period measured backward from the date an employee
   uses (or would use, pursuant to a request) DCFMLA leave.

   1616.2. Employers may choose any of the alternatives described in § 1616.1
   for
   
                          the leave entitlements, provided that the alternative
   chosen is applied
   
                          consistently and uniformly to all employees.  Employers
   shall inform
   
                          employees of the method it has chosen to calculate
   DCFMLA leave
   
                          entitlements either as part of its general notice to
   employees, as described
   
                          in § 1613, or in its eligibility notices to employees.

   1616.3. For District government purposes, the FMLA Coordinator shall utilize
   the “twenty-four (24)-month period forward” alternative described in §
   1616.1 (c).

   1616.4. For intermittent or reduced schedule leave, leave shall be counted
   based on the proportion of a normal workweek that the employee misses for
   DCFMLA leave purposes.  For example, if an employee, who normally works five
   (5) days a week, takes two (2) days of intermittent DCFMLA leave, that leave
   shall be counted as two fifths (2/5) of one (1) workweek.  If an employee who
   normally works forty (40) hours per week decreases to working thirty (30)
   hours per week due to reduced schedule DCFMLA leave, that leave shall be
   counted as one forth (1/4) of one (1) workweek for each week that such reduced
   schedule leave is maintained.

   1616.5. The employer may designate leave on an hourly basis.  Six hundred
   forty (640) hours shall equal 16 workweeks for a forty (40)-hour per week
   schedule.
