EXCEPTION TO ELIGIBILITY-SCHOOL EMPLOYEES (§ 4-1618)

1618.1. If the conditions of eligibility in § 1604 are met, a local

   secondary school (“school”) may require an employee who is employed
   principally in an instructional capacity to elect to:
   
   
   
   (a)	Take family or medical leave for periods not to exceed the exact duration
   of inpatient care or continuing treatment by a medical provider; or
   
   (b)	Transfer temporarily to an available alternative position offered by
   
   the educational agency or school for which the employee is qualified, which
   has equivalent pay and benefits, and better accommodates the recurring periods
   of leave than the employee’s regular employment position.

   1618.2. This section shall apply if the employee described in § 1618.1:
   
   (a)	Elects to take family leave or medical leave that is foreseeable based on
   	planned medical treatment or supervision;
   
   
   
   (b)	Would be on leave for greater than twenty percent (20%) of the total
   number of working days in the period during which leave would extend; and
   
   (c)	Complies with sections 3(g) or 4(c) of the DCFMLA (D.C. Official Code 	§
   32-502(g) or § 32-503(c)).
   
    	1618.3	If an employee of an educational agency or school who is employed
   
   principally in an instructional capacity begins family or medical leave more
   than five (5) weeks before the end of the academic term, the educational
   agency or school may require the employee to continue to take leave until the
   end of the term if:
   
   (a)	The leave is at least three (3) weeks in duration; and
   
   (b)	The return to employment would occur during the three (3) week period
   	before the end of the academic term.

   1618.4. If an employee of an educational agency or school who is employed
   principally in an instructional capacity begins medical or family leave under
   § 1605 or § 1606 during the period that commences from more than three (3)
   weeks and up to and including five (5) weeks before the end of the academic
   term, the educational agency or school may require the employee to continue to
   take leave until the end of the term if:
   
   (a)	The leave is greater than two (2) weeks in duration; and 
   
   (b)	The return to employment would occur during the two (2) week period before
   the end of the academic term.

   1618.5. If an employee of an educational agency or school who is employed
   principally in an instructional capacity begins leave under § 1605 or § 1606
   during the period that commences three (3) weeks or less before the end of the
   academic term and the duration of the leave is greater than five (5) working
   days, the educational agency or school may require the employee to continue to
   take leave until the end of the term.

   1618.6. For purposes of a restoration of employment determination under
   section 6(d)(2) of the DCFMLA (D.C. Official Code § 32-505(d)(2)), in the
   case of an educational agency or school, the determination shall be made on
   the basis of established educational agency or school policies, practices, and
   collective bargaining agreements.
