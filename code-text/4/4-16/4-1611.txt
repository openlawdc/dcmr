                                  DC REGULATIONS

THE ROLE OF THE OFFICE OF HUMAN RIGHTS-DISTRICT GOVERNMENT ONLY (§ 4-1611)

1611.1. OHR shall periodically examine DCFMLA use by employees of District
   agencies by assessing the following factors:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
         Whether the agencies have appointed an FMLA Coordinator;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
         How many DCFMLA requests were made during the previous
   
   fiscal year;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   How many DCFMLA requests were granted during the previous fiscal year;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   How many DCFMLA requests were denied during the previous fiscal year and the
   reason given for each denial;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   How long each employee was out during his or her DCFMLA leave; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Whether each request was for intermittent leave or for an extended period of
   time.

   1611.2. After an initial compliance review in FY 2010, OHR shall determine
   each agency’s compliance with the DCFMLA on a quarterly basis. Beginning
   with the first quarter in FY 2011, a quarterly assessment of the factors
   contained in § 1611.1 shall be conducted by each agency’s director or his
   or her designee, and a report thereof shall be sent to OHR.  OHR shall make an
   end of the fiscal year assessment of the quarterly reports and submit the
   results to the City Administrator.

   1611.3. With respect to District of Columbia government, each agency shall be
   responsible for its own compliance with DCFMLA.  The Department of Human
   Resources may play a consultative role and may issue administrative issuances,
   but it shall not be responsible for DCFMLA compliance of other agencies.
