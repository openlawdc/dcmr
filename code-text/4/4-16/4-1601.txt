                                  DC REGULATIONS

APPLICABILITY-COVERED EMPLOYERS-IN GENERAL (ยง 4-1601)

1601.1. This chapter shall apply to all employers that employ twenty (20) or
   more persons in the District of Columbia on or after April 1, 1991; provided
   that this chapter shall not apply to the United States government.

   1601.2. A private employer shall be covered if it maintains twenty (20) or
   more employees on the payroll during twenty (20) or more calendar workweeks
   (whether consecutive or not) in either the current or the preceding calendar
   year.

   1601.3. Once a private employer meets the threshold of twenty (20) employees
   
   during twenty (20) workweeks as specified in ยง 1601.2, the employer shall
   remain covered until it no longer employs twenty (20) employees for twenty
   (20) workweeks (whether consecutive or not) in the current or preceding year.

   1601.4. For example, if an employer employed twenty (20) employees during
   twenty (20) workweeks in the calendar year as of September 1, 2008, then
   subsequently dropped below twenty (20) employees before the end of calendar
   year 2008 and continued to employ fewer than twenty (20) employees during that
   year, the employer would continue to be covered throughout calendar year 2009
   because it met the coverage criteria for twenty (20) workweeks of the
   preceding calendar year 2008.

   1601.5. If the employer employs at least twenty (20) employees in the
   District, its eligible employees shall include those employees who work within
   the District.  The definition of employee, and the standard to determine
   whether an employee is employed in the District, is set forth in section
   1603.6.

   1601.6. The District of Columbia government shall be considered as a single
   employer under the DCFMLA, and the DCFMLA is applicable to every District
   government agency, office, and other subdivision, without regard to its
   individual size.
