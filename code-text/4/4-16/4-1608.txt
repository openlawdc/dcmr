                                  DC REGULATIONS

INTERACTION WITH THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT (§ 4-1608)

1608.1. The provision by an employer of unpaid DCFMLA leave to an employee who
   is exempt from minimum wage and overtime requirements of FLSA based on his or
   her status as a salaried executive, administrative, professional, or computer
   employee (see 29 CFR part 541) shall not cause the employee to lose the FLSA
   exemption.

   1608.2. If an employer provides unpaid DCFMLA leave to an employee who is
   considered an exempt employee under 29 CFR part 541, the employer may deduct
   pay from the employee’s salary for any hours taken as  DCFMLA leave within a
   workweek without affecting the exempt status of the employee.

   1608.3. When an exempt employee takes unpaid DCFMLA leave, an employer may
   deduct a proportionate part of the full salary for the time for which DCFMLA
   leave is taken.  For example, if an exempt employee who normally works forty
   (40) hours per week uses four (4) hours of DCFMLA leave, the employer could
   deduct ten percent (10%) of the employee’s normal salary that week.

   1608.4. When calculating the amount of pay allowed to be deducted under
   
   	§ 1608.2, the employer may use the hourly or daily equivalent of the
   employee’s full weekly salary or any other amount proportional to the time
   actually missed by the employee.

   1608.5. For an employee paid in accordance with the fluctuating workweek
   method of payment for overtime (see 29 CFR § 778.114), the employer, during
   the period in which intermittent or reduced schedule DCFMLA leave is taken,
   may compensate an employee on an hourly basis and pay only for the hours the
   employee works, including time and one-half the employee’s regular rate for
   overtime hours.

   1608.6. The change to payment on an hourly basis shall include the entire
   period during which the employee is taking intermittent leave, including weeks
   in which no leave is taken.

   1608.7. The hourly rate shall be determined by dividing the employee’s
   weekly salary by the employee’s normal or average schedule of hours worked
   during weeks in which DCFMLA leave is not being taken.

   1608.8. If an employer chooses to follow this exception from the fluctuating
   workweek method of payment, the employer must do so uniformly with respect to
   all employees paid on a fluctuating workweek basis who take DCFMLA leave.

   1608.9. If an employer does not elect to convert the employee’s compensation
   to hourly pay, no deduction may be taken for DCFMLA leave absences.

   1608.10. Once the need for intermittent or reduced scheduled leave is over,
   the employee may be restored to payment on a fluctuating workweek basis.
