CONCILIATION (§ 4-415)

415.1. At any time prior to the Hearing Tribunal’s rendering of a Final
   Decision and Order disposing of a complaint, the parties may engage in
   discussions of terms according to which the matter may be settled finally and
   to their mutual satisfaction.

   415.2. If the original parties agree upon terms of settlement, they shall
   reduce the terms to writing in an instrument which they shall sign; and
   subject to the approval of the Chairperson, the matter shall be closed.

   415.3. If the complainant’s privately retained representative has been duly
   designated as the agent or attorney of the Office, that person’s signature
   shall suffice to signify the Office’s assent to that agreement.

   415.4. The duly executed conciliation agreement shall be the final resolution
   of the matter before the Commission, whereby the complainant waives any
   further action, administrative or civil, in connection with the charges filed
   against the respondent. It shall be considered a Final Decision and Order of
   the Commission, and shall be enforceable as such.

   415.5. The Commission shall not make public any admissions or representations
   regarding the facts at issue made in connection with conciliation discussions
   without the parties’ written consent. The admissions or representations
   shall not be admissible as evidence in any proceeding before the Commission.
