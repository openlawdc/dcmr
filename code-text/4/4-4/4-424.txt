                                  DC REGULATIONS

ALTERNATE FORMS OF TESTIMONY (§ 4-424)

424.1. When a witness is unavailable, as defined by the Civil Rules of the
   Superior Court of the District of Columbia, to testify in person, or upon the
   agreement of the parties, the hearing examiner may admit the content of the
   proffered testimony in an alternate form, such as the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	An affidavit attested by the witness;
   
   
   
   (b)	A transcript of the deposition of the witness; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Written responses by the witness to interrogatories propounded by the
   parties.

   424.2. The hearing examiner shall require the party seeking the admission of
   the alternate form of testimony to provide notice and evidence of the witness
   unavailability, as well as a proffer of the relevance of the testimony.

   424.3. In the absence of the parties’ agreement as to admissibility of an
   alternate form of testimony of a witness not subject to the subpoena power of
   the Commission, the hearing examiner may exclude the testimony if the rights
   of the opposing party would be substantially prejudiced by its admission into
   evidence.

   424.4. With the exception of non-hearsay deposition testimony, the hearing
   examiner shall give testimony admitted into evidence under this section the
   same weight as other hearsay evidence.
