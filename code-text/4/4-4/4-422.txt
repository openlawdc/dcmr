   fact.

   422.6. Where any decision of the hearing examiner or the Hearing Tribunal
   rests on official notice of a material fact not appearing in the evidence of
   the hearing record, any party shall, upon timely request, be given the
   opportunity to introduce evidence showing to the contrary.

   422.7. The hearing examiner and the Hearing Tribunal shall not be bound by any
   other rules of evidence.
