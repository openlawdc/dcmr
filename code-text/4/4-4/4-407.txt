INTERVENORS (§ 4-407)

407.1. There shall be no right to intervene in Commission proceedings, but the
   hearing examiner may permit intervenors to participate in a proceeding;
   provided, that the intervention will not unduly delay or prejudice the rights
   of the parties.

   407.2. Any prospective intervenor shall request permission from the hearing
   examiner to intervene. The request shall be in writing, stating with

   law or fact in common.

   407.3. Any prospective intervenor shall provide notice of the motion to
   intervene, with supporting documentation to the original parties to the

   ruling on a motion to intervene by filing a written appeal with the Hearing
   Tribunal within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the ruling. Any response
   to the appeal shall be filed within five (5) calendar days of receipt of the
   appeal notice. The Hearing Tribunal shall rule on the appeal within fifteen
   (15) calendar days of receipt of a timely response or within fifteen (15)
   calendar days of the last day a timely response could have been filed.

   407.5. An intervenor shall be considered a party to the hearing process and
   shall be accorded the same rights as other parties, except that:
   
   
   
   (a)	An intervenor shall not have an independent right to a hearing; and
   
   
   
   (b)	An intervenor shall participate only in connection with issues directly
   affecting him or her as determined by the hearing examiner.
