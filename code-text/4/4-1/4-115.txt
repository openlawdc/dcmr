                                  DC REGULATIONS

SUMMARY DETERMINATIONS (§ 4-115)

115.1. After the probable cause determination and failure of the conciliation
   efforts, the Director may make a summary determination on the merits of a
   complaint based solely upon information in the complaint file.

   115.2. A summary determination is a second review and consideration of the
   facts to determine if the probable cause determination is appropriate. The
   summary determination does not review any of the no probable cause findings.
   It may result in an affirmation or reversal of the original probable cause
   decision.

   115.3. The Director may designate an independent reviewer to analyze the facts
   and make a recommendation as to whether probable cause exists to believe that
   discrimination has occurred.

   115.4. In making a summary determination, the Director may issue an order to
   the agency head requiring appropriate remedial action, including, but not
   limited to, hiring, reinstatement, promotion, rescission of adverse action, or
   award of compensatory credits which are authorized by existing personnel
   regulations and statutes.

   115.5. The Director may issue an order dismissing the complaint for lack of
   probable cause to credit the allegations.

   115.6. Any order issued by the Director shall be in writing and shall advise
   the complainant and the agency head of their right to request reconsideration
   or the reopening of the case by the Director pursuant to § 114.

   115.7. Within fifteen (15) days after issuance of any order by the Director,
   either party may request reconsideration or the reopening of the case pursuant
   to § 114.4.

   115.8. If the Director determines that a matter is not appropriate for summary
   determination, the complainant shall be advised of the right to a formal
   hearing before an independent hearing examiner, with a subsequent decision by
   the Director based upon the Hearing Examiner’s report and recommendations.

   115.9. The Director may decide that a summary determination, rather than a
   hearing, is the appropriate action for any complaint.  If the Director issues
   a summary determination order, the parties may request a reconsideration of
   the order within ten (10) days after the date of the Director’s order. 
   After the ten (10) day period, the parties shall be deemed to have waived the
   opportunity for reconsideration and no objection to a summary determination
   shall be considered by the Director except for good cause.

   115.10. The complainant shall have fifteen (15) days from receipt of the
   notice to notify the Director whether or not he or she wishes to have a
   hearing.

   115.11. If the complainant fails to respond to the hearing request within
   fifteen (15) days in accordance with § 109.9, the Director may make a
   determination on the merits of the complaint, based solely upon information in
   the complaint file, and may dismiss the complaint or order remedial action.
