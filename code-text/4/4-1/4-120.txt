FINAL DECISION OF THE DIRECTOR OHR AFTER THE HEARING (§ 4-120)

120.1. Following receipt of the Hearing Examiner’s recommendations or
   proposed decision or order, and any argument or proposed substitute order or
   findings submitted by a party, the Director shall do one of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Render a final decision which may adopt, reject, or modify the decision of
   the Hearing Examiner; or
   
   
   
   (b)		Remand the matter for further hearings.

   120.2. If the Director rejects or modifies the recommended decision of the
   Hearing Examiner, the final decision of the Director shall set forth in detail
   the specific reasons for rejection or modification.

   120.3. The final decision of the Director shall be served on the parties or
   their representatives and, if not a party, the agency involved.

   120.4. Either party may file a written request with the Director for
   reconsideration or to reopen the case within fifteen (15) days from the date
   of issuance of the final decision.

   120.5. A request for reopening will only be considered if the requesting party
   demonstrates that there is newly discovered evidence that is competent,
   relevant, and material and was not reasonably discoverable prior to issuance
   of the final decision by the Director and that such evidence, if credited,
   would alter the ultimate outcome in the case.

   120.6. The final decision of the Director on a complaint for which there has
   been no hearing shall be transmitted by letter to the parties or their
   representatives and, if not a party, to the agency involved, stating the basis
   for the decision, including the findings of fact, analysis, and conclusions of
   law.

   120.7. The letter transmitting the final decision of the Director shall advise
   the parties of their right to request reconsideration or the reopening of the
   case pursuant to § 114.4 or to seek judicial review of the decision by a
   court of competent jurisdiction.

   120.8. If either party requests reconsideration or the reopening of the case
   pursuant to § 114.4, and the Director determines that the case should be
   reconsidered or reopened, the Director shall inform the parties that the case
   is being reconsidered or reopened and that the final decision previously
   issued by the Director is vacated.

   120.9. If neither party requests reconsideration or the reopening of the case
   pursuant to § 114.4, the final decision of the Director shall become the
   final administrative action of the District government fifteen (15) days after
   issuance of the decision, and the parties shall be deemed to have exhausted
   all administrative remedies.

   120.10. If the Director decides not to grant a request for reconsideration or
   to reopen a case, the Director shall so notify the parties in writing, and at
   the time the notification is issued, the decision previously issued shall
   become the final administrative action of the District government.

   120.11. If no action is taken on a request for reconsideration or to reopen a
   case within one hundred twenty (120) days, the request shall be deemed
   disapproved and the decision previously issued shall become the final
   administrative action of the District government.

   120.12. In the interests of justice, the Director may sua sponte reopen or
   reconsider any case in which the Director has issued a decision at any time
   prior to the filing of an appeal by either party with a court of competent
   jurisdiction.

   120.13. If the Director decides to reconsider or reopen a case pursuant to §
   114.12, the Director shall inform the parties that the case is being
   reconsidered or reopened and that the decision previously issued by the
   Director is vacated.
