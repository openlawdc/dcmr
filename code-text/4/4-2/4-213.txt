                                  DC REGULATIONS

ATTORNEYS FEES (§ 4-213)

213.1. If the prevailing complainant was represented by a privately retained
   attorney in any case in which the Commission has found that the respondent
   engaged in discriminatory acts or practices in violation of the Human Rights
   Act of 1977, the complainant shall be entitled to a reasonable attorney’s
   fee for the number of hours reasonably expended by the complainant’s
   attorney on claims upon which the complainant prevailed.

   213.2. The reasonable hourly rate multiplied by the reasonable number of hours
   expended upon successful claims is presumed to be the reasonable attorney’s
   fee.

   213.3. In determining a reasonable hourly rate, the Commission shall consider
   the hourly rate charged by the prevailing complainant’s attorney for similar
   legal work in private representations. Where no hourly rate exists, or where
   otherwise necessary to arrive at a reasonable hourly-rate, the Commission may
   also consider rates charged in the community for similar legal work by
   attorneys of comparable skill, experience, and reputation.

   213.4. The prevailing complainant shall bear the burden of demonstrating that
   an upward adjustment of the presumed reasonable attorney’s fee is necessary
   to provide fair compensation to the prevailing attorney.

   213.5. The unsuccessful respondent shall bear the burden of demonstrating that
   a downward adjustment of the presumed reasonable attorney’s fee is necessary
   to avoid a windfall to the prevailing attorney.

   213.6. In determining whether an adjustment of the presumed reasonable
   attorney’s fee is warranted, the Commission shall be guided by Supreme Court
   decisions interpreting the attorney’s fee provisions of Title VII of the
   Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000 e-5(k) (1982); the Civil Rights
   Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. §1988 (1982); and other
   similar federal fee-shifting laws.

   213.7. The complainant’s attorney’s fee petition shall be filed with the
   Commission no earlier than twenty (20) days after the issuance of the
   Commission’s Final Decision and Order and no later than thirty (30) days
   after the issuance of the Commission’s Final Decision and Order.
   Supplemental petitions may be filed if the Commission’s Final Decision and
   Order is appealed to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.

   213.8. If a motion for reconsideration is filed, then the complainant shall
   file his or her attorney’s fee petition no earlier than twenty (20) days
   after the issuance of the Commission’s Final Decision and Order on Motion
   for Reconsideration and no later than thirty (30) days after the issuance of
   the Commission’s Final Decision and Order for Reconsideration. Supplemental
   petitions may be filed as in accordance with § 213.7.
