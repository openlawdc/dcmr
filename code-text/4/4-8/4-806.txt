                                  DC REGULATIONS

RECORDING OF GENDER AND NAME (ยง 4-806)

806.1. An entity covered under the Act shall not require an applicant to state
   whether the individual is transgender.

   806.2. If an application form asks for the applicant to identify as male or
   female, designation by the applicant of a sex that is inconsistent with the
   applicant&#8217;s assigned or presumed gender shall not be considered, without
   more, to be fraudulent or to be a misrepresentation for the purpose of adverse
   action on the application.

   806.3. An applicant&#8217;s giving of a name publicly and consistently used by
   the applicant, even when the name given is not the applicant&#8217;s legal
   name, shall not be grounds for adverse action, if the name given is consistent
   with the applicant&#8217;s gender identity or expression. However, where use
   of a person&#8217;s legal name is required by law or for a reasonable business
   purpose, the applicant may be required to disclose it.

   806.4. An applicant&#8217;s failure to disclose a change of gender or name
   (unless specifically required as part of an application process for a
   reasonable business purpose) shall not be considered grounds for an adverse
   action.
