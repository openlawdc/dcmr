                                  DC REGULATIONS

HARASSMENT AND HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT (ยง 4-808)

808.1. All harassment and actions that create a hostile environment based on
   gender identity or expression shall be prohibited.

   808.2. The following behaviors may constitute evidence of unlawful harassment
   and hostile environment:
   
   
   
   (a)	Deliberately misusing an individual&#8217;s preferred name form of address
   or gender-related pronoun;
   
   
   
   (b)	Asking personal questions about an individual&#8217;s body, gender
   identity or expression, or gender transition;
   
   
   
   (c)	Causing distress to an individual by disclosing to others that the
   individual is transgender; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Posting offensive pictures, or sending offensive electronic or other
   communications.
   
   
   
   	In determining whether there is unlawful harassment or a hostile environment,
   the totality of the circumstances surrounding the alleged violation of the Act
   must be considered, including the nature, frequency, and severity of the
   behavior, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere
   offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with the alleged
   victim. Ultimately the standard is an objective one, focusing on whether the
   behavior was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the
   victim&#8217;s employment, housing, education, or access to or use of public
   accommodations, or relations with a District of Columbia agency or contractor,
   and to create an abusive environment.
