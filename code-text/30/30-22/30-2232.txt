ALL OR NONE QUALIFICATIONS (ยง 30-2232)

2232.1. Unless the solicitation provides otherwise, a bid may be responsive
   even though the bidder specifies that award will be accepted only on all, or a
   specified group, of the items.

   2232.2. Bidders shall not be permitted to withdraw or modify an &#8220;all or
   none&#8221; qualification after bid opening because &#8220;all or none&#8221;
   qualifications are substantive and affect the rights of other bidders.
