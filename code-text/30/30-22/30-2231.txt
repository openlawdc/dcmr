                                  DC REGULATIONS

REJECTION OF INDIVIDUAL BIDS (ยง 30-2231)

2231.1. Any bid that fails to conform to the essential requirements of the IFB
   shall be rejected.

   2231.2. Any bid that does not conform to the applicable specifications shall
   be rejected unless the IFB authorized the submission of alternate bids and the
   supplies offered as alternates meet the requirements specified in the IFB.

   2231.3. Any bid that fails to conform to the delivery schedule or permissible
   alternates stated in the IFB shall be rejected.

   2231.4. A bid shall be rejected if the bidder imposes conditions that would
   modify requirements of the IFB or limit the bidder&#8217;s liability to the
   Agency. A bid shall be rejected if the bidder does the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Protects against future changes in conditions, such as increased costs, if
   total possible increased costs to the Agency cannot be determined;
   
   
   
   (b)	Fails to state a price and indicates that price shall be &#8220;price in
   effect at time of delivery&#8221; or words of equivalent meaning;
   
   
   
   (c)	States a price but qualifies it as being subject to &#8220;price in effect
   at time of delivery&#8221; or words of equivalent meaning;
   
   
   
   (d)	When not authorized by an IFB, the bidder conditions or qualifies a bid by
   stipulating that it is to be considered only if, before date of award, the
   bidder receives (or does not receive) award under a separate solicitation; or
   
   
   
   (e)	Limits the rights of the Agency under any contract clause.

   2231.5. A low bidder may be requested to delete objectionable conditions from
   a bid, so long as the conditions do not go to the substance, as distinguished
   from the form, of the bid or would give the bidder an unfair advantage over
   other bidders. A condition goes to the substance of a bid when it affects
   price, quantity, quality, or delivery of the items or services offered.

   2231.6. Any bid may be rejected if the contracting officer determines in
   writing that the bid price is unreasonable.

   2231.7. A bid received from any bidder that is suspended, debarred, or
   otherwise ineligible shall be rejected if the period of suspension, debarment,
   or ineligibility has not expired by the bid opening date.

   2231.8. Low bids received from bidders determined to be not responsible shall
   be rejected.

   2231.9. When a bid security is required and a bidder fails to furnish the
   security in accordance with the requirements of the IFB, the rules set forth
   in ยง2701 of Chapter 27 of Title 27 DCMR shall be applicable.

   2231.10. The originals of all rejected bids, and any written findings with
   respect to the rejections, shall be maintained in the contract file.

   2231.11. If the contracting officer determines that it is necessary to reject
   all bids, the contracting officer shall notify each bidder that all bids have
   been rejected and shall state the reason for the action.
