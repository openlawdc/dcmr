MISTAKES IN BIDS AFTER AWARD (§ 30-2235)

2235.1. If a mistake in a bid is not discovered until after award, the mistake
   may be corrected by contract amendment if correcting the mistake would be
   favorable to the Agency without changing the essential requirements of the
   specifications.

   2235.2. In addition to the cases contemplated in §2235.1, or as otherwise
   authorized by law, if a mistake in a bid is not discovered until after award,
   the Director shall make one (1) of the following determinations:
   
   
   
   (a)	To rescind a contract;
   
   
   
   (b)	To reform a contract to delete the items involved in the mistake or to
   reform a contract to increase the price if the contract price, as corrected,
   does not exceed that of the next lowest acceptable bid under the original IFB;
   or
   
   
   
   (c)	That no change shall be made in the contract as awarded.

   2235.3. Determinations under §§ 2235.2(a) and 2235.2(b) shall be made only
   on the basis of clear and convincing evidence that a mistake was mutual or
   unilaterally made by the contractor, and was so apparent as to have given the
   contracting officer notice of the probability of the mistake.

   2235.4. The contracting officer shall include in the contract file a record of
   each determination made in accordance with this section, the facts involved,
   and the action taken.
