EXCESSIVELY LONG MAILING LISTS (ยง 30-2213)

2213.1. Solicitation mailing lists shall be used to promote competition
   commensurate with the dollar value of the proposed contract.

   2213.2. If the number of bidders on a mailing list is excessive in relation to
   a specific procurement, the list may be reduced by either of the following
   methods:
   
   
   
   (a)	Rotation of lists or using a different portion of a list for separate
   procurements; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Using pre-solicitation notices instead of initially forwarding complete
   bid sets.

   2213.3. The fact that less than an entire mailing list is used shall not
   preclude furnishing of bid sets to other prospective bidders, upon request, or
   consideration of bids received from bidders to whom the IFB was not mailed or
   delivered.
