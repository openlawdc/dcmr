2227.1. The contracting officer may postpone a bid opening until after the
   time scheduled for bid opening under the following circumstances:
   
   
   
   (a)	If the contracting officer has reason to believe that the bids of an
   important segment of bidders have been delayed in the mail for causes beyond
   the control of bidders without fault or negligence, such as flood, fire,
   accident, weather conditions, or strikes; or
   
   
   
   (b)	If unanticipated events interrupt normal governmental processes so that
   the conduct of bid openings as scheduled is impractical.

   2227.2. At the time of a decision to postpone a bid opening, an announcement
   decision shall be publicly posted. If practical, before the issuance of a
   formal amendment of the IFB, the decision shall be informally communicated to
   prospective bidders who are likely to attend the scheduled bid opening.

   2227.3. When a bid opening is postponed, the time of actual bid opening shall
   be the time established in determining &#8220;late bids&#8221; or other late
   actions under ยง 2222.

   2227.4. The contracting officer shall prepare a written memorandum for the
   file explaining the circumstances of the postponement.

   2227.5. The contracting officer may proceed with the bid opening as soon as
   practical after the original scheduled time without prior amendment to the IFB
   or notice to bidders, whenever any delay incident to the issuance of the
   amendment or notice would not be in the best interests of the Agency.
