CONTRACT COST PRINCIPLES (§ 30-2027)

2027.1. A contractor or offeror shall submit cost or pricing data and shall
   certify that, to the best of the contractor&#8217;s or offeror&#8217;s
   knowledge and belief, the cost or pricing data submitted is accurate,
   complete, and current as of a mutually determined and specified date, before
   entering into the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Any contract awarded through competitive sealed proposals or through sole
   source procurement; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Any change order or contract modification.

   2027.2. Each contract, change order, or modification under which a cost and
   price certificate is required shall contain a provision that the price,
   including profit or fee, shall be adjusted to exclude any significant price
   increases occurring because the contractor furnished cost or price information
   which, as of the date specified in §2027.1, was inaccurate, incomplete, or
   not current.

   2027.3. The provisions of §§2027.1 and 2027.2 shall not be applicable to
   contracts for which the price negotiated is based on established catalogue or
   market prices of commercial items sold in substantial quantities to the
   general public, or to items or services for which the price is set by law or
   regulations.

   2027.4. The provisions of Chapter 33 of Title 27 DCMR shall apply to
   procurement by the Agency, except as provided otherwise in this section.
