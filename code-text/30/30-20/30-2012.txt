                                  DC REGULATIONS

SPECIAL CONTRACTING METHODS (ยง 30-2012)

2012.1. Unless restricted in an appropriations act, a contract for supplies,
   services, or other items may be entered into for periods which extend beyond
   the fiscal year in which the contract is executed.

   2012.2. Before the utilization of a multiyear contract, the Director of
   Procurement or his or her designee shall determine the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	That estimated requirements cover the period of the contract and are
   reasonably firm and continuing; and
   
   
   
   (b)	That a multiyear contract will serve the best interests of the Agency, and
   will encourage effective competition or will otherwise promote economies in
   procurement by the Agency.

   2012.3. Except for contracts authorized by law which are not subject to
   appropriations, if funds are not appropriated or made available for the
   continued performance in a subsequent year of a multiyear contract, the
   contract for the subsequent year shall be terminated, either automatically or
   in accordance with the termination clause of the contract, if any.

   2012.4. Unless otherwise provided for in the contract, the effect of
   termination is to discharge both the Agency and the contractor from future
   performance of the contract, but not from their existing obligations. The
   contractor shall be reimbursed for the reasonable value of any nonrecurring
   costs incurred but not amortized in the price of the supplies or services
   delivered under the contract.

   2012.5. The provisions of Chapter 20 of Title 27 DCMR shall apply to
   procurement by the Agency, except as provided in this section.
