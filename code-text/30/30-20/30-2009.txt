REVIEW AND ACCEPTANCE OF SUBCONTRACTING PLANS (ยง 30-2009)

2009.1. The contracting officer shall review each subcontracting plan for
   adequacy, ensuring that the required information, goals, and assurances are
   included.

   2009.2. The contracting officer shall consider each plan in terms of the
   circumstances of the particular procurement, including the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Previous involvement of certified minority businesses as prime contractors
   or subcontractors in similar procurements;
   
   
   
   (b)	Proven methods of involving certified minority businesses as
   subcontractors in similar procurements; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The previous success of methods the contractor intends to use to meet the
   goals and requirements of the plan, as evidenced by records maintained by
   contractors.

   2009.3. If, in a procurement by competitive sealed bidding, a bidder does not
   submit a plan which incorporates the required elements set forth in ยง2008.3,
   the bidder shall be ineligible for award.

   2009.4. If a plan, although responsive, reflects the bidder&#8217;s intention
   not to comply with its obligations under the plan, the contracting officer may
   find the bidder nonresponsible.

   2009.5. In competitive sealed proposals, the contracting officer shall
   determine whether the plan is acceptable based on the results of negotiation
   of the elements of the plan.

   2009.6. In determining the acceptability of a proposed subcontracting plan,
   the contracting officer shall do the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Evaluate the bidder&#8217;s or offeror&#8217;s past performance in
   awarding subcontracts for the same or similar supplies or services to
   certified minority businesses, or if information is not available on a
   specific type of supply or service, evaluate the bidder&#8217;s or
   offeror&#8217;s overall past performance;
   
   
   
   (b)	If the contract involves supplies or services that are particularly
   specialized or not generally available in the commercial market, consider the
   bidder&#8217;s or offeror&#8217;s current capacity to perform the work and the
   possibility of reduced subcontracting opportunities;
   
   
   
   (c)	Evaluate subcontracting potential, considering the nature of the supplies
   or services to be subcontracted, and the known availability of certified
   minority businesses in the geographical area where the work will be performed;
   and
   
   
   
   (d)	Evaluate the feasibility of the bidder&#8217;s or offeror&#8217;s proposed
   percentage goals.

   2009.7. The contracting officer may request the MBOC to review a sheltered
   market subcontracting plan within five (5) working days of receipt of the plan
   by the MBOC and submit recommendations to the contracting officer. The
   recommendations shall be considered advisory in nature.

   2009.8. When a solicitation requires submission of a subcontracting plan, the
   contracting officer shall ensure that an acceptable subcontracting plan is
   incorporated into and made a part of the contract.
