PROPOSAL EVALUATION FACTORS (ยง 30-2320)

2320.1. The evaluation factors that will be considered in evaluating proposals
   shall be tailored to each procurement and shall include only those factors
   that will have an impact on the selection of a contractor.

   2320.2. The contracting officer shall include in the solicitation the
   evaluation factors, including price or cost and any significant subfactors.
   The solicitation shall include the minimum requirements that apply to each
   evaluation factor and significant subfactor.

   2320.3. The contracting officer may include in the solicitation the numerical
   weights which may be used in the evaluation of the proposals.

   2320.4. Evaluation factors shall be stated in descending order of importance.

   2320.5. Price or cost to the Agency shall be included as an evaluation factor
   in each RFP.

   2320.6. While the lowest price or lowest total cost to the Agency may be an
   important or even a deciding factor in many contractor selections, the
   contracting officer may select the contractor whose proposal offers the
   greatest value to the Agency in terms of technical merit and other factors,
   even though the proposal selected does not offer the lowest price or cost, if
   it is in the best interests of the Agency.

   2320.7. When awarding a cost-reimbursement contract, the cost proposal shall
   not be controlling. The contracting officer shall consider which offeror can
   perform the contract in a manner most advantageous to the Agency, as
   determined by evaluation of proposals according to the established evaluation
   criteria.
