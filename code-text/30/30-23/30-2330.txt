NOTIFICATIONS, PROTESTS, AND MISTAKES (ยง 30-2330)

2330.1. The contracting officer shall notify each offeror whose proposal is
   determined to be unacceptable before award unless disclosure might prejudice
   the best interests of the agency.

   2330.2. If the proposal evaluation period for an RFP is expected to exceed
   thirty (30) days, or when a limited number of offerors have been selected as
   being within the competitive range, the contracting officer, upon determining
   that a proposal is unacceptable, shall promptly notify the offeror.

   2330.3. The contracting officer shall award a contract with reasonable
   promptness to the successful offeror by transmitting written notice of the
   award to that offeror.

   2330.4. Promptly after the award of each contract, the contracting officer
   shall notify unsuccessful offerors in writing, unless pre-award notice was
   given.

   2330.5. If a contract is awarded on a basis other than price alone, the
   contracting officer shall provide a debriefing for any unsuccessful offeror
   that submits a written request for debriefing, unless the director determines
   that to do so is not in the best interests of the agency.

   2330.6. If a debriefing is held, debriefing information shall include the
   agency&#8217;s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the
   proposal. However, point-by-point comparisons with other offerors&#8217;
   proposals shall not be made.

   2330.7. Debriefing shall not reveal the relative merits or technical standing
   of competitors or the evaluation scoring.
