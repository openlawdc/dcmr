NEGOTIATION AFTER CANCELLATION OF INVITATION FOR BIDS (ยง 30-2316)

2316.1. If the Director of Procurement (the &#8220;Director&#8221;) has
   determined that an invitation for bids (&#8220;IFB&#8221;) issued under
   Chapter 22 will be cancelled and that use of negotiation is appropriate to
   complete the procurement, the contracting officer may award a contract after
   using negotiation procedures without issuing a new solicitation if all of the
   following conditions are met:
   
   
   
   (a)	The contracting officer gives notice to each responsible bidder that
   submitted a bid in response to the IFB of the intention to use negotiation
   procedures and gives each interested responsible bidder a reasonable
   opportunity to negotiate;
   
   
   
   (b)	The negotiated price is the lowest price offered in response to the
   negotiation process by any responsible bidder; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The negotiated price is lower than the lowest rejected price bid by a
   responsible bidder in response to the original IFB.

   2316.2. If an IFB has been cancelled in accordance with ยง 2230.4(f) or
   2230.4(g) of Chapter 22, and the Director has authorized completion of the
   procurement through negotiation, the contracting officer shall proceed with
   the procurement in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, or the sole
   source provisions of Chapter 24 of this title, if applicable.
