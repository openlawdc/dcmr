                                  DC REGULATIONS

CANCELLED TICKETS (§ 30-503)

503.1 	A ticket which is printed in error for the Lucky Numbers, DC-4 and DC-5
   game(s) may be cancelled only on the date purchased and prior to the drawing
   break. The tickets shall be voided only by the issuing agent and the terminal
   that printed the ticket, and the player may request a refund or a replacement
   ticket. If for any reason the terminal that issued the ticket is inoperable
   prior to the drawing break, the player&#8217;s sole recourse shall be a refund
   of the ticket price.

   503.2. Exchange tickets issued pursuant to a multi-day wager shall not be
   cancelled.

   503.3. The Executive Director shall not pay a prize on any cancelled or voided
   on-line ticket except as provided in section 503.7.

   503.4. A ticket for POWERBALL®, KENO, Hot LottoTM, Sizzler, DC Daily 6TM,
   Rolling Cash 5TM, Quick CashTM, and HOT FIVETM tickets shall not be voided or
   cancelled.

   503.5. If an agent prints any of the tickets identified in section 503.4 in
   error, the agent shall be responsible for printing a corrected game ticket at
   no cost to the player.

   503.6. Agents shall forward all cancelled on-line tickets to the Agency. No
   cancelled on-line ticket shall be returned to the player.

   503.7. If a winning ticket has been inadvertently or erroneously cancelled by
   an agent and the player retains possession of the cancelled ticket, the
   Executive Director may, after investigating the total circumstances involved
   in cancelling the ticket, honor that cancelled winning ticket without regard
   to its failure to validate.

   503.8. Section 503.7 shall not be applicable if, before he or she left the
   agent location, the player knew, or should have known, that the wager was
   cancelled or in a game in which cancellation is not permitted.
