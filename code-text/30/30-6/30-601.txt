PAYMENT TO SINGLE CLAIMANTS ONLY (ยง 30-601)

601.1. A claim form shall be filed in the name of a single legal entity as
   claimant, either one individual or one organization. Multiple payees shall not
   be permitted.

   601.2. A claim may be entered in the name of an organization only if the
   organization possesses a Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) issued
   by the Internal Revenue Service and the number is shown on the claim form.
   Groups, family units, clubs, or organizations without a FEIN shall designate
   in writing one (1) individual to receive the prize.

   601.3. If the back of a ticket contains multiple signatures, or if a claim is
   erroneously entered with multiple claimants, the signators or claimants shall
   designate one (1) of them as recipient of the prize, if any. If they fail to
   designate an individual recipient, the Executive Director may designate any
   one of the signators or claimants as the sole recipient of the prize or may
   reject the claim.

   601.4. Payment of the prize to the sole recipient designated pursuant to
   ยง601.3 shall effect the full and complete discharge of liability to pay the
   prize provided by ยง611.

   601.5. Nothing in this Title shall be deemed to permit multiple payees on a
   single POWERBALL(R) ticket.
