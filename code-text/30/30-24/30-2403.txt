                                  DC REGULATIONS

SHELTERED MARKET PROCUREMENTS (§ 30-2403)

2403.1. When a procurement has been designated for the sheltered market under
   D.C. Law 1-95, the &#8220;Minority Contracting Act of 1976&#8243; (D.C. Code
   § 1-1141 et seq.) and only one (1) bid or proposal is received from a
   responsible, certified firm, the contracting officer shall not make an award
   to that proposed contractor unless the contracting officer determines that the
   proposed contractor qualifies as a sole source in accordance with this
   chapter, or the contracting officer follows the procurement procedures set
   forth in §§ 2403.2 through 2403.5.

   2403.2. If the contracting officer cannot justify procuring the supplies or
   services from the single sheltered market vendor on a sole source basis, the
   contracting officer shall do one (1) of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Cancel the Invitation for Bids (&#8220;IFS&#8221;) or Request for Proposal
   (&#8220;RFP&#8221;) and reissue the solicitation on the open market;
   
   
   
   (b)	In the case of an IFS issued under Chapter 22, determine whether the bid
   price is competitive with the open market in accordance with the provisions of
   §§ 2403.3 through 2403.5; or
   
   
   
   (c)	In the case of an RFP issued under Chapter 23, negotiate with the
   sheltered market vendor pursuant to §§ 2403.3 through 2403.5.

   2403.3. If the contracting officer, using the methods and standards set forth
   in Chapter 23 of this title, is able to determine from price history or price
   analysis that the bid price offered on the IFS by the single sheltered market
   vendor is reasonably competitive with a price that might be obtained on the
   open market, the contracting officer may issue the contract after negotiation
   pursuant to §§ 2403.4 and 2403.5.

   2403.4. Before attempting to negotiate a contract with the single sheltered
   market vendor under § 2403.2, the contracting officer, using the methods and
   standards set forth in Chapter 23 of this title, shall establish a
   pre-negotiation position based on a reasonable price and other terms under
   which the contract might be let in the open market.

   2403.5. The contracting officer shall negotiate with the sheltered market
   vendor on the basis of competitive price and contract terms and may award the
   contract if the price and other terms agreeable to the vendor are reasonably
   within the range of price and terms that could be obtained in the open market,
   and if issuing the contract is in the best interests of the Agency.

   2403.6. If the contracting officer is unable to negotiate a contract with the
   single sheltered market vendor on the basis of reasonably competitive price
   and terms, the contracting officer shall cancel the sheltered market
   solicitation and reissue the solicitation in the open market.
