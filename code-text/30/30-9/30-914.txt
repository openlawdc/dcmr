                                  DC REGULATIONS

POWERBALL(R) POWER PLAY PRIZE POOL AND PRIZE PAYMENT (§ 30-914)

The prize pool for all prize categories shall consist of up to forty-nine
   percent (0.49%) and ninety-six one-hundredths percent (0.96%) of each drawing
   period&#8217;s sales, including tax, after the POWERBALL® prize reserve
   accounts reach the amounts designated by the Executive Director in accordance
   with all agreements governing the conduct of POWERBALL® and Power Play.  Once
   the prize reserve accounts exceed the designated amounts, the excess shall
   become part of the prize pool.  Any amount remaining in the prize pool at the
   end of this game shall be carried forward to a replacement game prize reserve
   account or expended as otherwise directed by the Executive Director in
   accordance with all agreements governing the conduct of POWERBALL® and Power
   Play.

   914.2. An additional four-one hundredths of one percent (0.04%) of sales,
   including tax, may be collected and placed in trust in one (1) or more prize
   reserve accounts until the prize reserve accounts reach the amounts designated
   by the Executive Director in accordance with all agreements governing the
   conduct of POWERBALL® and Power Play.

   914.3. In certain rare instances, the POWERBALL® set prize amount may be less
   than the amount shown.  In such case, the Power Play prizes will be changed to
   an amount announced at the draw.  For example, if the Match 4+1 POWERBALL®
   set prize amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) becomes five thousand
   dollars ($5,000) under the rules of the POWERBALL® game, then a Power Play
   player winning that prize amount would win twenty thousand dollars ($20,000).
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Power Play does not apply to the POWERBALL® Grand Prize or to any Bonus
   Prize.
