PRIZE POOL(S) AND BONUS PRIZE (§ 30-907)

907.1. The Agency shall pay in prizes at least fifty percent (50%) of each
   week&#8217;s POWERBALL® sales from all tickets and shall allocate that amount
   to the winning pool or pools for payment of prizes for that game.

   907.2. The prize money allocated to the Grand Prize category shall be awarded
   equally to the number of game boards winning a Grand Prize.

   the prize money for that game drawing shall be added to the prize pool.

   907.4. Any amount remaining in the prize pool at the end of this game shall be
   carried forward to a replacement game or expended in a manner as directed by
   the Executive Director in accordance with District law.

   907.5. When the Grand Prize reaches the annuitized amount guaranteed by the
   Agency, two percent (2%) of sales, including tax, shall be placed in trust in

   agreements governing the conduct of the POWERBALL® game. Once the prize
   reserve accounts exceed the designated amounts, the excess shall become part
   of the prize pool. Any amount remaining in a prize reserve account at the end

   the excess over the amount needed to fund the advertised prize shall fund a
   pool which will be divided equally among Match 5 winners as a bonus prize
   (&#8220;Bonus Prize&#8221;).
