   946.5. Prize Reserve Funding.  Two and one thousand one hundred eighty-seven
   ten thousandths percent (2.1187%) of sales, including any specific statutorily
   mandated tax of a Selling Lottery to be included in the price of a lottery
   ticket, may be collected and placed in trust in the Sizzler Prize Pool or in
   one or more prize reserve accounts until the prize reserve accounts reach the
   amounts designated by the MUSL Product Group.

   946.6. In certain rare instances, the Hot Lotto® set prize amount may be less
   than the amount shown.  In such case, the Sizzler prizes will be a multiple of
   the new Hot Lotto® prize amount.  For example, if the Match 5 of the first
   set and none of the second set Hot Lotto® set prize amount of $30,000.00
   becomes $27,000.00 under the rules of the Hot Lotto® game, then a Sizzler
   player winning that prize would win $81,000.00 ($27,000.00 x 3).
