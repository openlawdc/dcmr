   926.4. The top prizes for the 8,9, and 10 Spot Games are each capped at a
   maximum top prize pool liability of $1,000,000 per drawing. The maximum top
   prize pool liability may reduce top prize payments in the 8,9, and 10 Spot
   Games under the following circumstances:
   
   
   
   (a)	If the $1,000,000 maximum top prize pool liability for any 8, 9,or 10 Spot
   Game is exceeded, all top prizes for the 8,9, or 10 Spot Game winners will be
   paid the minimum top prize allowed for that Spot Game based on a $1 dollar
   wager;
   
   
   
   (b)	If the payment of the minimum top prizes for the 8, 9, or 10 Spot Game is
   less than the $1,000,000 maximum top prize pool liability, the balance of the
   $1,000,000 maximum top prize pool liability will be paid to the 8,9, or 10
   Spot Game top prize winners in proportion to the amount each winner wagered;
   and
   
   
   
   (c)	If payment of the minimum top prizes for the 8, 9, or 10 Spot winners
   exceeds the $1,000,000 maximum top prize pool liability limit, the winnings
   will be distributed equally among the top prize 8,9, or 10 Spot Game top prize
   winners.
