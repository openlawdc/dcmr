   	* The above reflects the Gross Grand Prize Value; the “Advertised Grand
   Prize” is described elsewhere in these Rules.  The Gross Grand Prize Value
   amount will be reduced by federal and jurisdictional withholding taxes (if
   any) that will be remitted by the Lottery on behalf of the prizewinner with
   the prizewinner receiving the residual amount as their Grand Prize payment
   (subject to offsets).  The prize amount reported to the federal and
   jurisdictional revenue authorities by the Lottery as subject to income
   taxation shall reflect the amount paid to the prize winner (including any
   offsets) and also the amount remitted as withholding taxes to the federal and
   jurisdictional authorities (if any) on behalf of the prize winner.

   943.3. The prize money allocated to the Gross Grand Prize Value category shall
   be divided equally by the number plays winning the Grand Prize.

   943.4. If the prize pools are not fully funded and there are not sufficient
   funds in the prize pool to pay fixed prizes, the prizes shall be paid pursuant
   to § 943.5, including payment on a pari-mutuel basis if required.

   943.5. The prize pool percentage allocated to the fixed prizes (the cash prize
   of $30,000.00 thousand dollars or less) shall be carried forward to subsequent
   draws if all or a portion of it is not needed to pay the fixed prizes awarded
   in the current draw. If the total of the fixed prizes awarded in a drawing
   exceeds the percentage of the prize pool allocated to the fixed prizes, then
   the amount needed to fund the fixed prizes awarded shall be drawn from the
   following sources in the following order:
   
   (a) 	The amount allocated to the fixed prizes and carried forward from
   previous draws, if any.
   
   (b) 	An amount from the Prize Reserve Account, if available, not to exceed the
   balance of that account.
   
   (c) 	An amount from the set-aside account, if available not to exceed the
   balance of the account.

   943.6. If, after these sources are depleted, there are not sufficient funds to
   pay the fixed prizes awarded, the highest fixed prize shall become a
   pari-mutuel prize. If the amount of the highest fixed prize when paid on a
   pari-mutuel basis, drops to or below the next highest fixed prize and there
   are still not sufficient funds to pay the remaining fixed prizes awarded, the
   next highest fixed prize shall become a pari-mutuel prize. This procedure
   shall continue down through all fixed prize levels, if necessary, until all
   fixed prize levels become pari-mutuel prize levels. In that instance, the
   money available from the funding sources listed in this chapter shall be
   divided among the winning plays in proportion to their respective prize
   percentages.

   943.7. Minimum guaranteed prizes or increases offered by the Executive
   Director pursuant to § 942.14 may be waived if the alternate funding
   mechanism set out in Subsections §§ 943.5 and 943.6 becomes necessary.
