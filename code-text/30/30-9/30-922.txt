DESCRIPTION OF EXTRA GAME ENHANCEMENT (ยง 30-922)

922.1. The Agency may offer a game enhancement known as EXTRA to the public. A
   player who places a wager on Lucky Numbers or DC-4 may place an additional
   wager on a Lucky Numbers or DC-4 ticket by indicating to the agent that he
   wants to play EXTRA. Selection slips may not be used to place an EXTRA wager.

   922.2. A player who places a Lucky Numbers EXTRA wager will receive a Lucky
   Numbers EXTRA ticket containing three (3) additional electronically generated
   numbers, and a player who places a DC-4 EXTRA wager will receive a DC-4 EXTRA
   ticket containing four (4) additional electronically generated numbers.

   922.3. EXTRA numbers are randomly selected with the aid of a computer program
   which determines EXTRA instant winners.

   922.4. The EXTRA numbers and/or prize amounts appearing on a valid Lucky
   Numbers or DC-4 ticket shall be the only proof of an EXTRA wager or prize.

   922.5. An EXTRA prize may be claimed at an agent location immediately upon
   generation of a winning EXTRA ticket or at any time within one year of the
   date of the EXTRA wager.

   922.6. The price of an EXTRA wager shall be one dollar ($ 1). The price of a
   ticket containing an EXTRA wager shall be one of the following amounts: (a)
   the sum of the price of the Lucky Numbers and EXTRA wagers; or (b) the sum of
   the price of the DC-4 and EXTRA wagers.

   922.7. The EXTRA option is not available to players who use Quick Pick to make
   a Lucky Numbers or DC-4 wager using the Quick Pick selection method.

   922.8. An EXTRA winning ticket is a ticket that displays one (1) or more EXTRA
   prizes on the ticket. This occurs when there is an exact match by position and
   number between the EXTRA numbers and Lucky Numbers on the ticket, or between
   the EXTRA numbers and DC-4 numbers on the ticket, and a prize amount is
   displayed under the matching number(s). The amount of an EXTRA prize is the
   sum of the EXTRA prize amount(s) displayed on a valid winning ticket.

   922.9. Nothing in this section shall be construed to repeal, amend or modify
   any provision of this Title concerning Lucky Numbers or DC-4 except as
   provided in sections 503.4 and 503.5.
