                                  DC REGULATIONS

POWERBALL(R) FIXED PRIZE STRUCTURE (§ 30-909)

909.1. Provided the prize pools are fully funded, the fixed prize payments for
   POWERBALL® based on a two dollar ($2) bet are as follows:
   
   
   
   	Number of Matches Per Play
   
   
   
   (a)	All five (5) of the first set and	$2,000,000.00
   
   	none of the second set
   
   
   
   (b)	Any four (4) of the first set plus	$40,000.00
   
   	one (1) of the second set
   
   
   
   (c)	Any four (4) of the first set and	$ 200.00
   
   	none of the second set
   
   
   
   (d)	Any three (3) of the first set plus	$ 200.00
   
   	one (1) of the second set
   
   
   
   (e)	Any three (3) of the first set and	$14.00
   
   	none of the second set
   
   
   
   (f)	Any two (2) of the first set plus	$14.00
   
   	one (1) of the second set
   
   
   
   (g)	Any one (1) of the first set plus	$12.00
   
   	one (1) of the second set
   
   
   
   (h)	None of the first set plus	$12.00
   
   				one (1) of the second set

   909.2. If the prize pools are not fully funded and there are not sufficient
   funds in the prize pool to pay fixed prizes, the prizes shall be paid pursuant
   to §909.3, including payment on a pari-mutuel basis if required.
   
   
   
   909.3 	The prize pool percentage allocated to the fixed prize (the cash prize
   of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or less) shall be carried forward
   to subsequent draws if all or a portion of it is not needed to pay the fixed
   prizes awarded in the current draw. If the total of the fixed prizes awarded
   in a drawing exceeds the percentage of the prize pool allocated to the fixed
   prizes, then the amount needed to fund the fixed prizes awarded shall be drawn
   from the following sources in the following order:
   
   (a) 	The amount allocated to the fixed prizes and carried forward from
   previous draws, if any; and
   
   (b) 	An amount from the Prize Reserve Account, if available, not to exceed
   forty million dollars ($40,000.00) per drawing.

   909.4. If, after these sources are depleted, there are not sufficient funds to
   pay the fixed prizes awarded, the highest fixed prize shall become a
   pari-mutuel prize. If the amount of the highest fixed prize when paid on a
   pari-mutuel basis, drops to or below the next highest fixed prize and there
   are still not sufficient funds to pay the remaining fixed prizes awarded, the
   next highest fixed prize shall become a pari-mutuel prize. This procedure
   shall continue down through all fixed prize levels, if necessary, until all
   fixed prize levels become pari-mutuel prize levels. In that instance, the
   money available from the funding sources listed in this chapter shall be
   divided among the winning plays in proportion to their respective prize
   percentages.

   909.5. Pursuant to all agreements governing the conduct of the POWER BALL®
   game, the Executive Director may offer guaranteed minimum Grand Prize amounts,
   or minimum increases in the Grand Prize amount, between drawings or make other
   changes in the allocation of prize money if the Executive Director finds it is
   in the best interest of the game. Minimum guaranteed prizes or increases may
   be waived if the alternate funding mechanism set out in §§909.3 and 909.4
   becomes necessary.
