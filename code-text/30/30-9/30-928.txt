DESCRIPTION OF KENO SPIN (ยง 30-928)

928.1. The Agency may offer a game enhancement to the KENO Game that shall be
   known as KENO SPIN. Nothing in sections 928 and 929 shall be construed to
   repeal, amend or modify any provisions of this title concerning KENO except as
   provided herein.
   
   
   
   KENO SPIN offers KENO players a chance to multiply their KENO winnings by a
   factor of 1,2,3,4,5, or 10 in any single drawing.

   928.2. If a player wins KENO and played KENO SPIN, the player&#8217;s winnings
   will be multiplied by the KENO SPIN number that was selected in the KENO SPIN
   drawing. The KENO SPIN drawing selections are 2,3,4,5,10, or &#8220;Try
   Again&#8221;. The notation, &#8220;Try Again&#8221; represents the number one
   (1) in the KENO SPIN drawing.

   928.3. A KENO player must complete the following steps to add KENO SPIN to a
   wager:
   
   
   
   (a)	Complete a KENO bet slip marking the KENO SPIN box on the bet slip; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Pay the total amount wagered for the KENO and KENO SPIN wager.

   928.4. A KENO SPIN wager is an additional $1.00 for every dollar wagered for
   KENO. For example, if a player wagers $2.00 for 3 consecutive drawings, the
   KENO amount wagered is $6.00. If the player wants to add KENO SPIN the ticket
   cost will double for a total cost of $12.00. The maximum KENO SPIN wager is
   $200.

   928.5. A separate random KENO SPIN drawing will be conducted for each KENO
   drawing. The KENO SPIN drawing will be selected by a computer-driven random
   number generator. The results of each KENO SPIN drawing will be displayed
   along with the corresponding KENO drawing results on a monitor at identified
   agent locations. Drawing results are also available on all lottery agent or
   claim center lottery terminals.

   928.6. The following table sets forth the probability of various KENO SPIN
   numbers being selected during a single KENO SPIN drawing:
