DESCRIPTION OF THE LUCKY NUMBERS GAME (§ 30-902)

902.1. The Agency may operate a three-digit daily numbers game using a fixed
   payout (&#8220;Lucky Numbers&#8221;).

   902.2. Lucky Numbers is a daily three-digit game in which the player may wager
   fifty cents (50¢) or one dollar ($ 1) on any one of the following bet types:
   
   
   
   (a)	Straight: A wager whereby a winning result is achieved only when the three
   (3) digit number specified by the player matches in exact order with the
   official winning number drawn by the Agency for that drawing event;
   
   
   
   For example, if the winning number is &#8220;123&#8243; then only the bets
   placed on &#8220;123&#8243; in that exact order will be winners.
   
   
   
   (b)	Six-Way Combination: A wager whereby a winning result is achieved when any
   combination of three (3) different digits specified by the player matches the
   official winning number drawn by the Agency for that drawing event. This is
   the equivalent of six (6) straight wagers on a single ticket at six (6) times
   the base cost;
   
   
   
   For example, if the winning number is &#8220;123&#8243; then any combination
   bet placed on &#8220;123,&#8221; (i.e. &#8220;132,&#8221;, &#8220;231,&#8221;
   &#8220;213,&#8221; &#8220;321,&#8221; or &#8220;312&#8243;) will be a winner
   of a straight bet.
   
   
   
   (c)	Three-Way Combination: A wager whereby a winning result is achieved when
   any combination of three (3) digits (with any two (2) of the three (3) digits
   being the same) specified by the player matches the official winning number
   drawn by the Agency for that drawing event. This is the equivalent of three
   (3) straight wagers on a single ticket at three (3) times the base cost;
   
   
   
   For example, if the winning number is &#8220;711,&#8221; then any combination
   bet placed on &#8220;711,&#8221; (i.e. &#8220;117,&#8221; or
   &#8220;171&#8243;) will be a winner of a straight bet.
   
   
   
   (d)	Straight/Six-Way Box (on one ticket): A wager whereby the player can place
   a straight bet and a six-way box bet for the same number on a single ticket.
   The player can win on both the straight and box bets when the three (3) digits
   specified by the player match in exact order the official winning number drawn
   by the Agency for that drawing event. The player can win on the box portion
   when any other combination of the three (3) digits selected by the player
   matches the winning number drawn by the Agency for that drawing event. Wagers
   are limited to fifty cents (50¢) on the straight and fifty cents (50¢) on
   the box portion for a total of one dollar ($1) per ticket;
   
   
   
   For example, if the winning number is &#8220;123,&#8221; then only the bets
   placed on &#8220;123&#8243; in that exact order will be winners on both
   portions of the ticket. However, boxed bets placed on &#8220;132&#8243; (i.e.,
   &#8220;231,&#8221; &#8220;213,&#8221; &#8220;321,&#8221; or &#8220;312&#8243;)
   will be winners in the box portion only.
   
   
   
   (e)	Straight/Three-Way Box (on one ticket): A wager whereby the player can
   place a straight bet and a three-way box bet for the same number on a single
   ticket. The player can win on both the straight and box bets when the three
   digits specified by the player match in exact order with the official winning
   number drawn by the Agency for that drawing event. The player can win on the
   box portion when any other combination of the three (3) digits (with any two
   (2) of the three (3) digits being the same) selected by the player matches the
   winning number drawn by the Agency for that drawing event. Wagers are limited
   to fifty cents (50¢) on the straight portion and fifty cents (50¢) on the
   box portion for a total of one dollar ($1) per ticket;
   
   
   
   For example, if the winning number is &#8220;311,&#8221; then only bets placed
   on &#8220;311&#8243; in that exact order will be winners on both portions of
   the ticket. However, bets placed on &#8220;113&#8243; or &#8220;131&#8243;
   will be winners in the box portion only.
   
   
   
   (f)	Six-Way Box: A wager whereby a winning result is achieved when any
   combination of three (3) different digits specified by the player matches the
   official winning number drawn by the Agency for that drawing event. This is
   the equivalent of six (6) wagers for a single-unit ticket cost;
   
   
   
   For example, if the winning number is &#8220;123&#8243; then all box bets
   placed on &#8220;123&#8243; (i.e. &#8220;132,&#8221; &#8220;231,&#8221;
   &#8220;213,&#8221; &#8220;321,&#8221; or &#8220;312&#8243;) will be winners.
   
   
   
   (g)	Three-Way Box: A wager whereby a winning result is achieved when any
   combination of three digits (with any two (2) of the three (3) digits being
   the same) specified by the player matches the official winning number drawn by
   the Agency for that drawing event. This is the equivalent of three (3) wagers
   for a single-unit ticket cost;
   
   
   
   For example, if the winning number is &#8220;711,&#8221; then all box bets
   placed on &#8220;711&#8243; (i.e. &#8220;117,&#8221; or &#8220;171&#8243;)
   will be winners.
   
   
   
   (h)	Back Pair: A wager whereby a winning result is achieved when the last two
   (2) digits specified by the player match in exact order with the last two (2)
   digits of the official winning number drawn by the Agency for that drawing
   event. This is the equivalent of ten (10) wagers for a single-unit ticket
   cost; and
   
   
   
   For example, if the winning number is &#8220;123,&#8221; then only bets placed
   on &#8220;X23&#8243; will be winners.
   
   
   
   (i)	Front Pair: A wager whereby a winning result is achieved when the first
   two (2) digits specified by the player match in exact order the first two (2)
   digits of the official winning number drawn by the Agency for that drawing
   event. This is the equivalent of ten (10) wagers for a single-unit ticket
   cost.
   
   
   
   For example, if the winning number is &#8220;123,&#8221; then only bets placed
   on &#8220;12X&#8221; will be winners.
