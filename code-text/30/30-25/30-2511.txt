UNPRICED PURCHASE ORDERS (ยง 30-2511)

2511.1. A contracting officer shall use an unpriced purchase order only under
   the following circumstances:
   
   
   
   (a)	When the transaction will not exceed the small purchase limit set forth in
   this chapter;
   
   
   
   (b)	When it is impractical to obtain pricing in advance of issuance of the
   purchase order; and
   
   
   
   (c)	When a purchase is for repairs to equipment requiring disassembly to
   determine the nature and extent of repairs, material available from only one
   (1) source and for which cost cannot be readily established, or supplies or
   services for which prices are known to be competitive but exact prices are not
   known.

   2511.2. A contracting officer shall issue each unpriced purchase order by
   using a written purchase order form and shall set a realistic dollar ceiling,
   either for each line item or for the total order. The dollar limitation shall
   be an obligation subject to adjustment when the firm price is established.
