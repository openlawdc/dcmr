NONCOMPETITIVE SMALL PURCHASES (ยง 30-2501)

2501.1. A procurement for an amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000) or less
   may be made without obtaining competitive quotations if the contracting
   officer determines that the price is reasonable.

   2501.2. Noncompetitive small purchases shall be distributed equitably among
   suppliers. When practical, a quotation shall be solicited from a vendor other
   than the previous supplier before placing a repeat order.

   2501.3. The contracting officer shall take action to verify that the price
   paid for an item or service is reasonable in the following instances:
   
   
   
   (a)	When purchasing an item for which no comparable pricing information is
   readily available (such as an item that is not the same as, or is not similar
   to, other items that have been recently purchased on a competitive basis); or
   
   
   
   (b)	When the contracting officer suspects or has information (such as
   comparison to previous prices paid or personal knowledge of the item involved)
   to indicate that the price may not be reasonable.
