                                  DC REGULATIONS

USE OF SMALL PURCHASE PROCEDURES (ยง 30-2500)

2500.1. The small purchase procedures set forth in this chapter may only be
   used for the procurement of supplies, services, and other items when the total
   amount of the procurement does not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000), in
   accordance with D.C. Code ยง 1-1110 (1992 Repl. Vol.).

   2500.2. A contracting officer shall not use small purchase procedures when the
   requirement can be met by using one of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	A requirements term contract;
   
   
   
   (b)	An indefinite quantity term contract;
   
   
   
   (c)	A federal or District supply schedule; or
   
   
   
   (d)	Another source of supply, other than sealed bids or proposals, which would
   result in a lower price for the same or comparable supplies or services.

   2500.3. A contracting officer shall not use small purchase procedures when the
   procurement requirement is initially estimated to exceed ten thousand dollars
   ($10,000), even though the resulting award does not exceed that limit.

   2500.4. If a procurement requirement totals more than ten thousand dollars
   ($10,000), a contracting officer shall not split the procurement into several
   purchases that are each less than the limit in order to permit the use of the
   small purchase procedures.

   2500.5. A procurement requirement shall not be parceled, split, divided, or
   purchased over a period of time in order to avoid the ten thousand dollar
   ($10,000) limitation for use of small purchase procedures. However, this shall
   not preclude the use of small purchase procedures for different requirements
   for the same or similar items which arise independently and for which the
   contracting officer cannot reasonably plan or execute a single procurement.

   2500.6. A contracting officer shall use the small purchase procedure that is
   most suitable, efficient, and economical based on the circumstances of each
   procurement.
