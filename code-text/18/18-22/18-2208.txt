                                  DC REGULATIONS

RIGHT-OF-WAY[COLON] INTERSECTIONS (§ 18-2208)

2208.1. When two (2) vehicles approach or enter an intersection from different
   highways at approximately the same time, the driver of the vehicle on the left
   shall yield the right-of-way to the vehicle on the right.

   2208.2. The driver of a vehicle intending to turn to the left shall yield the
   right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction which is
   so close as to constitute an immediate hazard.

   2208.3. Except when directed to proceed by a police officer, a police cadet or
   an official traffic control device, every driver of a vehicle approaching a
   STOP sign shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before
   entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if no
   crosswalk, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver
   has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering
   the intersecting roadway.

   2208.4. After having stopped for a stop sign, the driver shall yield the
   right-of-way to any traffic in the intersection or approaching on another
   roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when
   the driver is moving across or within the intersection or junction of
   roadways. The driver shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians.

   2208.5. The driver of a vehicle approaching a YIELD sign shall in obedience to
   the sign, slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions and, if
   required for safety to stop, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if
   none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or
   if no crosswalk, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the
   driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before
   entering the intersecting roadway.

   2208.6. After slowing or stopping for a yield sign, the driver of a vehicle
   shall yield the right-of-way to any traffic in the intersection or approaching
   on another roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
   time the driver is moving across or within the intersection or junction of
   roadways. The driver shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians; Provided,
   that if the driver is involved in a collision with a vehicle in the
   intersection or with a pedestrian, after driving past a YIELD sign without
   stopping, the collision shall be considered prima facie evidence of failure to
   yield the right-of-way.

   2208.7. The driver of a vehicle approaching a traffic circle shall yield the
   right-of-way to traffic already within the circle unless official traffic
   control devices indicate otherwise.

   2208.8. The driver of a vehicle entering a freeway by way of an access ramp
   shall yield the right-of-way to traffic on the freeway.

   2208.9. The presence of an appropriate official sign underneath an official
   STOP sign may permit a vehicle to turn right without stopping.

   2208.10. The right-of-way rules set forth in §§ 2208.1 and 2208.2 shall be
   modified at through highways and otherwise as stated in §§ 2207 through 2210
   and 2103.

   2208.11. A driver of any vehicle shall stop and give the right-of-way to a
   pedestrian who has begun crossing on the &#8220;WALK&#8221; signal to continue
   to the opposite sidewalk or safety island, whichever is nearest.

   2208.12. When official traffic-control signals are not in place or not in
   operation, the driver of a vehicle shall stop and give the right-of-way to a
   pedestrian crossing the roadway within any marked crosswalk or unmarked
   crosswalk at an intersection.
