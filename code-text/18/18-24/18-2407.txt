                                  DC REGULATIONS

TEMPORARY AND EMERGENCY PARKING RESTRICTIONS (§ 18-2407)

2407.1. Whenever by reason of the scheduled assembly of a large number of
   persons at any public or semi-public building, embassy, legation, stadium, or
   other place of assembly, it is determined that the free flow of traffic upon
   the street or streets leading to or from the building, embassy, legation,
   stadium or other place of assembly, is or will be impeded by reason of the
   parking of vehicles, parking shall be prohibited (or restricted) on the
   street(s) during the hours that the free flow of traffic is or will be impeded
   by parking.

   2407.2. Whenever construction work upon or adjacent to any highway causes the
   width of the roadway to be reduced, parking shall be prohibited upon the
   roadway adjacent to and for a reasonable distance on either side of the
   construction work. If it is determined that the reduced roadway width will
   impede the flow of traffic except where the highway is physically divided into
   separate roadways carrying traffic in opposite directions, parking shall also
   be prohibited on the side of the roadway opposite to and for a reasonable
   distance on either side of the construction work.

   2407.3. The Director may have signs erected adjacent to a funeral home
   indicating a prohibition of parking in front of one (1) entrance to each such
   establishment; Provided, that the space indicated by such signs shall not
   exceed the width of the place of business of the funeral director or sixty
   feet (60 ft.), whichever is shorter.

   2407.4. Upon the erection of signs prohibiting parking during a funeral,
   parking shall be prohibited as indicated on the signs, except that vehicles
   which are part of a funeral cortege may park within the space not more than
   one (1) hour before and during the funeral.

   2407.5. In addition to the areas set forth in § 2407.3, parking shall be
   prohibited on streets adjacent to houses or establishments from which funerals
   are to be conducted for a reasonable time before and during the service,
   within the area that it is found necessary to park vehicles which are part of
   the funeral cortege.

   2407.6. Parking shall be prohibited in places upon highways where trucks,
   moving vans or other vehicles are required to remain for commercial
   operations; Provided, that such parking prohibition shall be used only if it
   is determined that the parking of these vehicles abreast of other parked
   vehicles would reduce the roadway available for the flow of traffic on that
   side of the highway to twenty feet (20 ft.) or less; Provided further, that
   such prohibition of parking shall not continue for such purpose beyond eight
   (8) hours at any one time.

   2407.7. Parking shall be prohibited on streets for which parade permits have
   been issued by the Chief of Police, including streets necessary for assembling
   and disbanding of parades, for a reasonable time prior to, during, and for a
   reasonable time after such parades.

   2407.8. When, as a result of the closing of any street to traffic by reason of
   a parade or emergency conditions, the flow of traffic on adjacent streets is
   or will be increased, or it is found that the free flow of traffic upon the
   adjacent streets is or will be impeded due to the parking of vehicles, parking
   shall be prohibited during such hours that it is found that the free flow of
   traffic is or will be impeded.

   2407.9. [REPEALED]

   2407.10. [REPEALED]

   2407.11. [REPEALED]

   2407.12. Whenever a special events parking permit placard has been issued to
   allow parking in a specified restricted area or on a specified restricted
   street or portion thereof, the placard must be displayed on the left side of
   the dashboard of the vehicle so that it is clearly visible from the outside of
   the vehicle.

   2407.13. Notwithstanding § 2407.1, the Director is authorized to grant
   applications to reserve no more than four (4) parking spaces for no more than
   sixteen (16) hours at or near the entrance of a building where a wedding or
   funeral is being held. For purposes of this section, a parking space is
   twenty-two (22) feet long.

   2407.14. Notwithstanding § 2407.2, the Director is authorized to grant
   applications to prohibit parking at or near construction sites and other
   places necessary to protect the health or safety of the public.

   2407.15. If the Director grants an application pursuant to § 2407.4, 2407.5,
   2407.13 or 2407.14, the applicant may be issued the applicable parking
   prohibition or reservation signs upon payment of the fee established in §
   2407.20. If the application is accepted and the fee paid, the Director shall
   issue a permit indicating the number of signs allowed and the time by which
   the signs must be removed. However, nothing in this section grants authority
   for permit holders to park in areas with posted parking restrictions that
   prohibit parking or to park in areas from 12 midnight to 5 a.m. The Director
   may, in his discretion, waive the restrictions associated with prohibited or
   reserved parking signs in this section.

   2407.16. Any permit holder who fails to remove a sign after the expiration
   time stated on the permit shall be subject to a civil fine for each additional
   day the sign is not removed equal to $ 25 per day, per sign, plus the
   Department&#8217;s costs of removing the unlawful sign.

   2407.17. No person, other than a permit holder or the representative of a
   permit holder or contractor of an authorized agency of the District of
   Columbia may install or remove a sign on public space that prohibits or
   reserves parking. Any person violating this subsection shall be subject to a
   civil fine of $ 100 per day for each day that an unauthorized sign remains
   installed or removed during its authorized posting period plus the
   Department&#8217;s costs of removing the unlawful sign or reissuing an
   authorized sign.

   2407.18. No person may vandalize or deface a sign in public space that
   prohibits or reserves parking. Any person violating this subsection shall be
   subject to a civil fine of $ 100 for the 1st violation, $ 200 for the 2nd
   violation, and $ 400 for the 3rd and subsequent violations.

   2407.19. The Department may remove any sign installed or remaining on public
   space in violation of §§ 2407.16 and 2407.17, which violation shall be
   enforced and adjudicated pursuant to the Litter Control Administration Act of
   1985, effective March 25, 1986 (D.C. Law 6-100; D.C. Official Code § 8-801 et
   seq.)

   2407.20. The fee to reserve parking pursuant to § 2407.13 or to prohibit
   parking pursuant to § 2407.14 shall be equal to the number of hours in which
   parking is to be reserved or prohibited multiplied by the number of spaces
   reserved and further multiplied by the hourly metered rate set forth in §
   2404 applicable to the spaces. If signs are to be displayed on a non-metered
   street, the rate for the signs shall be the same as that of the lowest meter
   rate assessed in the District as set forth in § 2404.

   2407.21. The fee to be paid pursuant to § 2407.20 shall be increased as
   follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	The fee to reserve parking spaces pursuant to § 2407.13 shall be
   increased by fifteen percent (15%) if the applicant requests to reserve
   parking for more than eight (8) and less than sixteen (16) hours; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The fee to prohibit parking pursuant to § 2407.14 shall be increased if
   the applicant requests to prohibit parking for more than eight (8) months as
   follows:
   
   
   
   Additional months				Increase
   
   
   
   9 to 14						25%
   
   
   
   15 to 20						50%
   
   
   
   Each additional 6 months		an additional 25%

   2407.22. The Director may, by rulemaking, increase the fees to cover the costs
   of producing and issuing the signs and of enforcing the provisions of this
   section in accordance with section 6 of the Parking Amendment Act of 2006,
   passed on 2nd reading on July 11, 2006 (Enrolled version of Bill 16-536).

   vehicle in violation of the parking restrictions stated on the sign.

   2407.24. A Sign prohibiting or reserving parking shall be erected at least 24
   hours in advance in a non-residentially zoned area. If a sign is erected in a
   residentially zoned area, the sign prohibiting or reserving parking shall be
   erected at least 72 hours in advance. The Director for extraordinary
   circumstances shown may waive this required advance notice for good cause.

   allow parking in a specified restricted area or on a specified restricted
   street or portion of that street, to be valid the permit shall be affixed by
   its own adhesive to the lower left (driver&#8217;s) side of the windshield so
   that it is clearly visible through the windshield of the vehicle. Expired
   permits shall not be left visible on a vehicle.
