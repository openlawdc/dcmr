RESERVED PARKING SPACE (§ 18-2710)

2710.1. The Director may reserve one (1) on-street parking space for any
   District resident who applies in writing for a reserved space and who:
   
   
   
   (a)	Holds a valid license plate or permit for a person with a physical
   disability issued by the District pursuant to § 2701.1 (a), (b), (c), or (d);
   
   
   
   (b)	Is legally domiciled at a single-family residence in the District of
   Columbia that is her or his principal place of residence;
   
   
   
   (c)	Cannot avail herself or himself of any other form of transportation;
   
   
   
   (d)	Has no readily available parking within a distance that is reasonably
   accessible for the resident as determined by rules promulgated pursuant to
   this chapter; and
   
   
   
   (e)	Does not have off-street parking available in the form of a driveway,
   garage, or private parking space immediately adjacent to or on the premises of
   the single family dwelling where the physically disabled person resides.

   2710.2. The reserved space shall be in front of the applicant’s residence,
   if parking is permitted by law. If parking is not permitted by law, the
   Director may reserve a legal parking space as close as possible to the
   residence of the applicant, if the applicant satisfies the requirements of §
   2710.1. The Director shall give due consideration to the concerns of adjacent
   property owners regarding the space to be reserved.

   2710.3. No more than one (1) on-street parking space may be reserved pursuant
   to § 2710.1 for each single-family residence, even though more than one (1)
   qualified applicant may reside at the same residence.
