105.1. Each applicant for a driver’s license, learner’s permit, or renewal
   of a license or permit must meet minimum visual requirements.

   105.2. Testing may be done by confrontation or perimetry, both eyes open.

   105.3. An applicant who has only one (1) functioning eye must submit a report
   from an optometrist or ophthalmologist attesting to the applicant’s field of
   vision.

   105.4. Minimum requirements shall include form field of vision of at least one
   hundred thirty degrees (130 [degrees]) in the horizontal meridian.

   105.5. Applicants whose field of vision is less than one hundred thirty
   degrees (130 [degrees]) but more than one hundred ten degrees (110 [degrees]),
   but whose vision meets the visual acuity requirements described in § 105.6
   may be referred to the Director for approval.

   105.6. Each applicant must demonstrate visual acuity of at least 20/40 in one
   eye and no less than 20/70 in the other eye, with or without corrective
   lenses.

   105.7. If an applicant&#8217;s visual acuity fails to meet the requirements of
   § 105.6, the following requirements, with or without corrective lenses, shall
   apply:
   
   
   
   (a)	If the applicant has visual acuity of less than 20/70 in one eye and no
   less than 20/40 in the other eye, or has only one (1) functioning eye of not
   less than 20/40, a permit may be issued;
   
   
   
   (b)	If the applicant has visual acuity of less than 20/40, but not less than
   20/70, in the best or only eye, and a field of vision of at least one hundred
   forty degrees (140 [degrees]) in the horizontal meridian, a license may be
   issued with a restriction that limits driving to daylight hours only; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The license shall be issued upon the favorable recommendation of an
   optometrist or ophthalmologist. The applicant may not operate a vehicle unless
   the vehicle is equipped with a functional outside mirror on the left side.

   105.8. An applicant who is being treated for glaucoma or cataracts may be
   issued a driver’s license if, in addition to meeting all other requirements
   of this chapter, he or she submits to the Department a medical eye report
   completed by an ophthalmologist on a medical form furnished by the Director.

   105.9. The eye report required by § 105.8 shall be submitted annually unless
   the ophthalmologist indicates a need for more or less frequent reports; or
   unless three (3) consecutive annual reports reveal no appreciable
   deterioration in visual acuity or field of vision, in which case less frequent
   reports may be satisfactory.

   105.10. Any permittee who develops glaucoma, cataracts or loses functioning in
   one eye shall, within thirty (30) days of learning of the condition, appear at
   the Department with a medical eye report completed by an ophthalmologist on a
   medical form supplied by the Department.

   105.11. Any permittee whose corrected visual acuity or filed of vision becomes
   less than the minimum allowed under § 105.6 shall report to the Department
   for re-testing within thirty (30) days of learning of the condition.

   105.12. The Director may reissue a license with conditions or revoke the
   license of a permittee who no longer meets the visual acuity requirements of
   § 105.6 or who submits information pursuant to § 105.10 that indicates that
   the person is not physically qualified to operate a motor vehicle in a manner
   not to jeopardize the safety of individuals or property.

   105.13. Failure to appear when required by §§ 105.10 or 105.11 may be
   grounds for revocation pursuant to § 302.2.

   105.14. The Director may suspend a driver’s permit if more time is required
   to evaluate the permittee and may, in his or her discretion, issue a temporary
   license to a permittee if consistent with public safety.
