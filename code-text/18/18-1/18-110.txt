110.1. Unless the Director provides otherwise, the initial term of a
   driver’s license issued after August 16, 2008 and the next renewal term of
   any driver’s license issued before that date, shall expire on the
   licensee’s birth date occurring in the eighth (8th) year of the license
   term, and may thereafter be renewed for up to an eight (8)-year period ending
   on the licensee’s birth date.

   110.2. The Director is authorized to issue a motor vehicle driver&#8217;s
   license valid for a period of less than the maximum periods provided for in
   subsection 110.1 whenever the Director finds, on the basis of medical or
   psychiatric evidence, that a periodic determination is required as to the
   physical or mental qualification of an applicant to operate a motor vehicle
   safely.

   110.3. The Director may extend the validity of a driver’s license without an
   additional fee for such additional period or periods as the Director, in his
   or her discretion, may; provided, that such additional period or periods shall
   not exceed eight (8) years in the aggregate.

   110.4. The Director may require any person applying for renewal of a
   driver&#8217;s license to take and successfully pass a test of the
   applicant&#8217;s eyesight and knowledge of the traffic laws of the District.

   110.5. The Director may require any applicant to take and successfully pass
   any additional test(s) as he may find reasonably necessary to determine the
   licensee&#8217;s qualifications according to the type or general class of
   license applied for, and such examination may include any or all of the other
   tests required or authorized upon original application under the provisions of
   this chapter.

   110.6. The Director may defer the expiration of the license of a resident of

   exceed six (6) years upon such terms and conditions as the Director may
   prescribe. In the event that such driver&#8217;s license is lost, mutilated,
   or badly worn, the Director may issue a replacement without charge and
   indicate the extended expiration date on the replacement license.

   110.7. A license may be renewed at any time in advance of expiration of a
   current license to take effect on the day following the expiration of the
   current license; Provided, that if the application for renewal is dated more
   than sixty (60) days prior to expiration of the current license, the renewed
   license shall be dated as of the day of issuance.

   110.8. Any person applying for renewal of a driver’s license who owes the

   eligible to participate in the Director’s deferred payment plan, as provided
   in § 3007.5.
