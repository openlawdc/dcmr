1317.1. The Director may authorize a state, an employer, a private drivers
   training facility, or a department, agency or instrumentality of a local
   government to administer the skills tests, if the following conditions are
   met:
   
   
   
   (a)	The tests given by the third party are the same as those which would
   otherwise be given by the District of Columbia; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The third party has an agreement with the District of Columbia containing,
   at a minimum, provisions that:
   
   
   
   (1)	Allow the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), or its representative,
   and the District of Columbia to conduct random examinations, inspections and
   audits without prior notice;
   
   
   
   (2)	Require the District of Columbia to conduct on-site inspections at least
   annually;
   
   
   
   (3)	Require that all third party examiners meet the same qualification and
   training standards as District of Columbia examiners, to the extent necessary
   to conduct skills tests in compliance with the minimum federal standards
   established in 49 CFR Part 383, subparts G and H;
   
   
   
   (4)	Require that, at least on an annual basis, District of Columbia employees
   take the tests actually administered by the third party as if the District of
   Columbia employee were a test applicant, or that District of Columbia test a
   sample of drivers who were examined by the third party to compare pass/fail
   results; and
   
   
   
   (5)	Reserve unto the District of Columbia the right to take prompt and
   appropriate remedial action against the third-party testers in the event that
   the third-party fails to comply with District of Columbia or minimum federal
   standards for the commercial driver’s license testing program, or with any
   other terms of the third-party contract.

   1317.2. An applicant who takes and passes driving tests administered by an
   authorized third party shall provide evidence to the Department of Motor
   Vehicles that he or she has successfully passed the driving tests administered
   by the third party.
