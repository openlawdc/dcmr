INSPECTION OF VEHICLE LOADS (§ 18-2506)

2506.1. Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
   vehicle and load is unlawful is authorized to require the driver to stop and
   submit to a weighing of the vehicle and load by means of either portable or
   stationary scales, and may require that the vehicle be driven to the nearest
   public scales.

   2506.2. Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that
   the weight is unlawful, the officer may require the driver to stop the vehicle
   in a suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is
   removed as may be necessary to reduce the gross weight of the vehicle to the
   limit permitted under this chapter. All material so unloaded shall be cared
   for by the owner or operator of the vehicle at the risk of the owner or
   operator.
