                                  DC REGULATIONS

COMPUTATION OF TIME (ยง 18-1001)

1001.1. When, by notice given under this chapter, or by order or decision of
   an Examiner, an act is required or allowed to be done at or within a specified
   time, the Examiner for cause shown may, at any time in his or her discretion,
   do either of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	With or without motion or notice, order the period enlarged, if request
   therefor is made before the expiration of the period originally prescribed or
   as extended by a previous order; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Upon motion made after expiration of the specified period, permit the act
   to be done where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect and
   only then in extraordinary cases where the denial of an enlargement of time
   would operate to deny a person adversely affected thereby any opportunity to
   notice and hearing.

   1001.2. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this chapter,
   by notice, order, rule, or regulation of the Department, or by statute, the
   day of the act, event, or default after which the designated period of time
   begins to run is not to be included.

   1001.3. The last day of the period so computed shall be included unless it is
   a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the
   end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

   1001.4. Whenever a party has the right or is required to take action within
   the period prescribed by this chapter, by a notice given thereunder, or by an
   order or regulation, the examiner may, before the expiration of the prescribed
   period, with or without notice, extend the period; or, upon motion, permit the
   act to be done after the expiration of the specified period, where the failure
   to act is clearly shown to have been the result of excusable neglect.
