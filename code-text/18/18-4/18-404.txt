                                  DC REGULATIONS

NON-NEGOTIABLE CERTIFICATES OF TITLE; SUPPLEMENTARY CERTIFICATES OF TITLE FOR
LIENS (§ 18-404)

404.1. If the Director is not satisfied as to the ownership of a vehicle or
   that there are no undisclosed security interests in it, the Director may issue
   a non-negotiable certificate of title.

   404.2. A non-negotiable certificate shall contain a description of the vehicle
   and other pertinent identifying information required by the Director and shall
   conform as nearly as possible to the requirements of § 403, except that the
   certificate form shall not contain any provision for assignment and warranty
   of title by the owner or any other person, and the word “NONTRANSFERABLE”
   shall be inscribed clearly and in large type across the face of the
   instrument.

   404.3. Upon receipt of proof of ownership satisfactory to the Director that
   the owner of the vehicle is entitled to a regular certificate, and upon
   surrender of the non-negotiable certificate, the Director may issue a
   certificate to the owner.

   404.4. Whenever an owner of a vehicle for which a certificate is outstanding
   gives a lien upon the vehicle and delivers the certificate to the Recorder for
   the purpose of placing that lien on the certificate, and the Recorder
   determines that the certificate does not provide sufficient space for the
   Recorder to place upon its face any or all of the liens against the vehicle,
   the Recorder shall deliver the certificate to the Director who shall issue a
   supplementary certificate without fee to the Recorder.
