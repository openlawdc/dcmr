                                  DC REGULATIONS

COMPLIANCE WITH EXHAUST EMISSION STANDARDS (§ 18-751)

751.1. No motor vehicle shall be allowed to operate on the streets or highways
   of the District that does not comply with the exhaust emission standards
   prescribed pursuant to § 752, except as provided in this section.

   751.2. After December 31, 1982, no owner of a motor vehicle shall operate or
   allow the operation of a vehicle on the streets and highways of the District
   that does not comply with the exhaust emission standards prescribed pursuant
   to § 752, except as provided in this section.

   751.3. Prior to December 31, 1982, the Director may not refuse to register any
   motor vehicle in the District solely because of the exhaust emission levels of
   the vehicle.

   751.4. The Director may issue a conditional approval, lasting until the next
   scheduled inspection, for any motor vehicle which is unable to meet exhaust
   emission standards prescribed in § 752 when the Director has determined that
   all reasonable repairs, having a minimum value of four hundred fifty dollars
   ($ 450), have been made and that further repairs are not mechanically nor
   economically feasible given the age, value, and condition of the vehicle.

   751.5. The cost of any repairs covered by vehicle warranties shall not be
   included in the four hundred fifty dollars ($ 450) minimum adjusted repair
   value. The four hundred fifty dollars ($ 450) minimum repair value shall be
   adjusted annually in January of each year by the percentage, if any, that the
   Federal Consumer Price Index differs from the Federal Consumer price Index for
   1989. After December 31, 1995, repairs shall be performed by an Automotive
   Emissions Repair Technician who has been certified or recertified pursuant to
   § 618.

   751.6. An owner shall apply for a conditional approval with the Bureau of
   Motor Vehicle Services, 301 C Street, Room 1018, Washington, D.C. 20001.
   Before a vehicle owner may apply for a conditional approval, all exhaust
   emission components must be in original configuration and in compliance with
   18 DCMR § 750.

   751.7. The application shall contain the information requested by the Director
   including, but not limited to, the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	One (1) written estimate of the cost of repair from a licensed motor
   vehicle repair facility;
   
   
   
   (b)	Valid receipts and work orders to demonstrate that all reasonable repair
   work, within the meaning of §§ 751.4 and 751.5, has been completed; and
   
   
   
   (c)	For estimates submitted and repairs performed after December 31, 1995,
   proof that the estimate was prepared and repair work was performed by a
   Automotive Emissions Repair Technician who has been issued a certification or
   recertification pursuant to § 618.4 or 618.5, or who is authorized by a state
   to perform IM-240 related repairs.

   751.8. In determining whether to grant a conditional approval pursuant to §§
   751.4 and 751.5, the Director shall consider the following factors in addition
   to the factors listed in §§ 751.4 and 751.5:
   
   
   
   (a)	The primary use of the motor vehicle;
   
   
   
   (b)	The average annual mileage the motor vehicle is operated;
   
   
   
   (c)	The engineering design of the motor vehicle;
   
   
   
   (d)	The cost to repair the motor vehicle in relation to the fair market value
   of the vehicle; and
   
   
   
   (e)	Whether Federal law or regulation pertaining to imported motor vehicles
   provides for that motor vehicle to be exempt from the standards set forth in
   § 752.
