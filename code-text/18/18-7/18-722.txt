RESERVOIR CAPACITY AND CHECK VALVES (ยง 18-722)

722.1. Each bus, truck or truck tractor with air-operated brakes shall be
   equipped with at last one (1) reservoir sufficient to ensure that, when fully
   charged to the maximum pressure as regulated by the air compressor governor
   cut-out setting a full service brake application may be made without lowering
   such reservoir pressure by more than twenty per cent (20%). Each reservoir
   shall be provided with means for readily draining accumulated oil or water.

   722.2. Each truck with three (3) or more axles equipped with vacuum
   assistor-type brakes and every truck tractor and truck used for towing a
   vehicle equipped with vacuum brakes shall be equipped with a reserve capacity
   or a vacuum reservoir sufficient to ensure that, with the reserve capacity or
   reservoir fully charged and with the engine stopped, a full service brake
   application may be made without depleting the vacuum supply by more than forty
   percent (40%).

   722.3. All motor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers and pole trailers, when
   equipped with air or vacuum reservoirs or reserve capacity as required by this
   chapter, shall have the reservoirs or reserve capacity safeguarded by a check
   valve or equivalent device so that, in the event of failure or leakage in its
   connection to the source of compressed air or vacuum, the stored air or vacuum
   shall not be depleted by the leak or failure.
