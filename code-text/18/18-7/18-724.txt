   NOTE: The information set forth in § 724.2 through 724.7 of this section is
   to be used in understanding and applying the standards for braking performance
   set forth in the Braking Standards Table in § 724.1.

   724.2. There is a definite mathematical relationship between the figures in
   columns 2 and 3 of the table in § 724.1. If the decelerations set forth in
   column 3 are divided by 32.2 ft/sec., the column 2 figures will be obtained.
   (For example, 17 divided by 32.2 gives 52.8%) Column 2 is included in the
   table because certain brake-testing devices utilize this factor.

   724.3. The decelerations in column 3 of the table are an indication of the
   effectiveness of the basic brakes and, as measured in practical brake testing,
   are the maximum braking decelerations attained at some time during the stop.
   This deceleration, as measured in brake tests, cannot be used to compute the
   values in column 4 of the table because it is not sustained at the same rate
   over the entire period of the stop. The deceleration increases from zero to a
   maximum during a period of brake-system application and brake-force buildup.
   Also, other factors may cause the deceleration to decrease after reaching the
   maximum. The added distance which results because a maximum deceleration is
   not sustained is included in the figures in column 4 but is not indicated by
   the usual brake-testing device for checking deceleration.

   724.4. The values in column 4 of the table and the values in column 3 are not
   directly related. Column 4 is a definite measure of the overall effectiveness
   of the braking system, being the distance traveled between the point at which
   the driver starts to move the braking controls and the point at which the
   vehicle comes to rest. It includes distance traveled while the brakes are
   being applied and the distance traveled while the brakes are retarding the
   vehicle.

   724.5. The distance traveled during the period of brake system application and
   brake force build-up varies with vehicle type, being negligible for many
   passenger cars and greatest for combinations of commercial vehicles. This fact
   accounts for the variation from twenty-five to fifty feet (25 ft. to 50 ft.)
   in the numerical values in column 4 for the various classes.

   724.6. The deceleration value in column 3 of the table is the same for all
   classifications except passenger vehicles (other than buses) because brakes on
   vehicles in the B, C, and D classifications are capable with reasonable
   maintenance of producing the required decelerations as measured by
   brake-testing devices. A higher deceleration value is warranted for passenger
   cars by Bureau of Public Roads test data.

   724.7. Each motor vehicle and combination of vehicles, at all times and under
   all conditions of loading, upon application of the service brake, shall be
   capable of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Developing a braking force that is not less than the percentage of its
   gross weight for its classification, as set forth in column 2 of the table in
   § 724.1;
   
   
   
   (b)	Decelerating to a stop from not more than twenty miles per hour (20 mph)
   at not less than the ft./sec. for its classification set forth in column 3 of
   the table in § 724.1; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Stopping from a speed of twenty miles per hour (20 mph) in not more than
   the distance for its classification set forth in column 4 of the table in §
   724.1, such distance to be measured from the point at which movement of the
   service brake pedal or control begins.

   724.8. Tests for deceleration and stopping distance shall be made on a
   substantially level (not to exceed plus or minus one per cent (1%) grade),
   dry, smooth, hard surface that is free from loose material.
