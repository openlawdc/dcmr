   revocation set forth in this chapter.

   300.3. A non-resident’s privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the highways
   of the District shall be subject to suspension or revocation by the Director
   in the same manner and for like cause(s) as a District driver’s license may
   be suspended or revoked.

   300.4. If a non-resident driver of a motor vehicle is convicted of an offense

   jurisdiction where the driver resides.

   300.6. The Director is authorized to suspend or revoke the license of any
   resident of the District or the privilege of a nonresident to drive a motor
   vehicle in the District upon receiving notice of the conviction of or
   determination of the liability of that person in another jurisdiction of an
   offense or infraction in the other jurisdiction which, if committed in the
   District, would be grounds for suspension or revocation of the license of a
   driver.

   300.7. The Director may give the same effect to conduct of a resident in
   another jurisdiction as would be provided by the laws of the District if the
   conduct had occurred in the District.
