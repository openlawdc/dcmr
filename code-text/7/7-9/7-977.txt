                                  DC REGULATIONS

AMOUNT OF WAGES OF EMPLOYEES WHICH MAY BE SUBJECTED TO GARNISHMENT PROCEEDINGS
FOR PAY PERIODS OTHER THAN WEEKLY (ยง 7-977)

977.1. The maximum part of the disposable wages of any individual for pay
   periods other than weekly pay periods which may be subjected to garnishment
   are established as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	Where the pay period is for less than one (1) workweek, the exemption from
   garnishment shall be the same as that for a weekly pay period. Thus, so long
   as the Federal minimum wage prescribed by ยง6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor
   Standards Act of 1938 is three dollars and thirty-five cents ($3.35) an hour,
   the following formula shall apply:
   
   
   
   (1)	If an individual&#8217;s disposable wages paid or payable for a pay period
   of less than one (1) workweek are one hundred dollars and fifty cents
   ($100.50), thirty times three dollars and thirty-five cents (30 x $3.35) or
   less, wages may not be garnished in any amount;
   
   
   
   (2)	If an individual&#8217;s disposable wages paid or payable for a pay period
   of less than one (1) workweek are more than one hundred dollars and fifty
   cents ($100.50), but less than one hundred thirty-four dollars ($134), only
   the amount above one hundred dollars and fifty cents ($100.50) of disposable
   wages shall be subject to garnishment; or
   
   
   
   (3)	If an individual&#8217;s disposable wages paid or payable for a pay period
   of less than one (1) workweek are one hundred thirty-four dollars ($134) or
   more, not more than twenty-five percent (25%) of disposable wages shall be
   subject to garnishment.
   
   
   
   (b)	Where the pay period is longer than one (1) workweek, the weekly statutory
   exemption formula shall be transformed to a formula, providing equivalent
   restrictions on wage garnishment as follows:
   
   
   
   (1)	The twenty-five percent (25%) part of the formula shall apply to the
   aggregate disposable wages for all the work-weeks or fractions thereof
   compensated by the pay for the pay period;
   
   
   
   (2)	The &#8220;multiple&#8221; of the Federal minimum hourly wage equivalent
   to that applicable to the disposable wages for one (1) week shall be
   represented by the following formula: the number of workweeks, or fractions
   thereof times (x) thirty (30) times three dollars and thirty-five cents ((x) x
   30 x $3.35) (the applicable Federal minimum wage). For the purpose of this
   formula, a calendar month is considered to consist of four and one-third (4
   1/3) workweeks. Thus, so long as the Federal minimum wage is three dollars and
   thirty five cents ($3.35) an hour, the &#8220;multiple&#8221; applicable to
   the disposable wages shall be computed as follows:
   
   
   
   (i)	For a two week period, two hundred and one dollars ($201, two times thirty
   times three dollars and thirty-five cents (2 x 30 x $3.35);
   
   
   
   (ii)	For a monthly period, four hundred thirty-five dollars and fifty cents
   ($435.50), four and one-third times thirty times three dollars and thirty-five
   cents (4 1/3 x 30 x $3.35); and
   
   
   
   (iii)	For a semimonthly period, two hundred and seventeen dollars and
   seventy-five cents ($217.75), two and one-sixth times thirty times three
   dollars and thirty-five cents (2 1/6 x 30 x $3.35).
   
   
   
   (3)	The &#8220;multiple&#8221; for any other pay period longer than one (1)
   week shall be computed in a manner consistent with this paragraph.

   977.2. This section became effective January 1, 1981.
