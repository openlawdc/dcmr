                                  DC REGULATIONS

PROGRAM NOTICES OF INITIAL DETERMINATIONS AND ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS (§
7-105)

105.1. The Program shall issue a notice of determination (NOD) regarding each
   ID and ED pursuant to this section. An NOD of an ID or ED shall be issued
   using a standard form developed by the Program that informs the claimant of
   the right to request reconsideration or a hearing before the OHA, whichever is
   applicable. Sample NODs shall be published on ORM’s website.

   105.2. An NOD shall be issued:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   When accepting a claim for benefits or when modifying, suspending, or
   terminating benefits;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   When changing the type of benefits a claimant receives;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   When amending an NOD pursuant to § 111 of this chapter;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   When accepting or denying a claim for recurrence of injury pursuant to § 120
   of this chapter; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   When issuing a schedule award pursuant to section 2307 of the Act.

   105.3. An NOD shall contain a narrative description of the rationale for the
   decision, cite relevant portions of the supporting documentation or claim
   file, and attach supporting documentation.

   105.4. An NOD shall be sent to the claimant&#8217;s last known address by
   first-class mail, postage prepaid. A certificate of service shall be executed
   by the Program at the time of mailing.  If the claimant is represented by an
   attorney, a copy of the NOD shall be sent to the claimant’s attorney. 
   Failure to send a copy of the NOD to the claimant’s attorney shall not
   constitute a failure to provide notice to the claimant, nor shall it toll any
   deadlines under this chapter, unless failure to do so unduly prejudices the
   claimant.
