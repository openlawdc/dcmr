                                  DC REGULATIONS

CLAIMS DEEMED ACCEPTED AND CONTROVERSION (§ 7-112)

112.1. A newly filed claim for benefits shall be deemed accepted by the
   Program if the Program does not issue an initial notice of determination or
   notice of controversion within thirty (30) days of the date the claim was
   first reported to the Program.  This subsection only applies to newly filed
   claims and does not apply to any other request for compensation or benefits
   under this chapter, including claims for amended NODs under § 111.5(b) or
   claims of recurrences of injuries under § 120 of this chapter.

   112.2. When a claim is deemed accepted pursuant to this section, payment of
   compensation shall become effective on the thirty-first (31st) day.

   112.3. In the event that the Program does not have sufficient information to
   make an initial determination regarding compensability within thirty (30)
   days, the Program shall issue a notice of controversion to the employee.

   112.4. The Program shall issue the notice of controversion before the
   thirtieth (30th) day following the date the claim was reported, shall explain
   the reasons a determination cannot be made, and shall describe the information
   or actions needed to make a determination.  Reasons for a controversion may
   include:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The employee has not submitted all the required forms or information;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The Program does not have sufficient medical evidence to make a determination;
   or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The employee has not attended an orientation program pursuant to § 108.11 or
   has failed to cooperate pursuant to § 111.4.

   112.5. If the notice of controversion is issued because the employee has not
   submitted all the required forms or information, the notice shall inform the
   employee that he or she has fifteen (15) days to send the Program the required
   forms or information.  The notice shall further state that if the Program does
   not receive the required forms or information, the employee’s claim will be
   held in abeyance until the required forms or information is received.

   112.6. If the employee does not send the Program the required forms or
   information within fifteen (15) days of the request in § 112.5, the Program
   shall issue a second notice of controversion.  If the required forms or
   information is not received after the second notice, the Program shall take no
   further action on the claim until it receives the required forms or
   information.

   112.7. If a claim is controverted and held in abeyance for two (2) years after
   the date of injury or death and the employee has not sent the Program the
   required forms or information, the Program shall issue a notice to the
   employee denying the claim pursuant to section 2322(a) of the Act.
