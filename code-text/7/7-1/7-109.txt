TIME OF ACCRUAL OF RIGHT AND CONTINUATION OF PAY (§ 7-109)

109.1 	When an employee makes a claim for temporary total disability (TTD)
   compensation, the employee shall be entitled to continuation of his or her
   full salary, or continuation of pay, pursuant to this section.

   109.2. An employee is not entitled to indemnity payments or continuation of
   pay for the first three (3) business days of temporary disability which would
   otherwise have been work days for the employee, except:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   When the disability exceeds fourteen (14) days; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   When the disability is followed by permanent disability.

   109.3. An employee shall use sick, annual, or other available leave during the
   first three (3) business days of temporary disability for any days which would
   otherwise have been work days for the employee.
   
   
   
   109.4 	Commencing on the first day following the three (3) days described in
   §§ 109.2 and 109.3, the claimant’s employment agency shall furnish
   continuation of pay to the employee as follows:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   To employees hired before January 1, 1980, for a period of forty-five (45)
   consecutive calendar days or until the Program has either upheld or denied the
   employee’s claim for TTD, whichever occurs first; and
   
   
   
   (b) 	To all other employees for twenty-one (21) consecutive calendar days or
   until the Program has either upheld or denied the employee&#8217;s claim for
   TTD, whichever occurs first.
   
   109.5 	Claims for continuation of pay may be controverted or denied by the
   Program in the following situations:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   When the injury or occupational disease occurred off the employing
   agency&#8217;s premises and the employee was not in the course of employment;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   When the injury was caused by the employee&#8217;s willful misconduct, when
   the employee intended to bring about the injury or death on himself or herself
   or another person, or when the employee&#8217;s intoxication was the direct
   cause of the injury;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   When the injury does not prevent the employee from working;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   When the employee was not in active pay status at the time of injury or
   occupational disease (for example, in the case of leave without pay or absence
   without official leave);
   
   
   
   (e) 	When the stoppage of work first occurs six (6) months or more after the
   date of injury, if the claim has already been accepted for medical benefits
   only;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   When the employee initially reports the injury after termination of
   employment; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   When the Program denies the claim.
   
   
   
   109.6 	If continuation of pay has been paid to an employee whose claim for TTD
   is subsequently and finally denied or whose claim for compensation has been
   denied or controverted pursuant to § 109.5, the Program shall forward to the
   employee a form for the employee to elect whether the payments made shall be
   charged to the employee’s sick or annual leave.  The employee shall be
   required to fill out and return the form to the Program within thirty (30)
   days.

   109.7. If the employee returns the form to the Program, the Program shall
   forward it to the Office of Pay and Retirement Services in the Office of the
   Chief Financial Officer for processing.

   109.8. If the employee does not return the form to the Program within thirty
   (30) days, the Program shall inform the employee’s employment agency.  The
   employment agency shall charge the continuation of pay payments to sick leave
   or, if the employee does not have any available sick leave, to annual leave. 
   If the employee has no leave available, the employment agency shall inform the
   Program and the payments shall be deemed overpayment of pay, in accordance
   with section 2329 of the Act.
