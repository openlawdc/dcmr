DEATH BENEFITS (§ 7-122)

122.1. In the case of the death of an employee, the Program shall determine
   the compensation owed to the employee’s beneficiary or beneficiaries by
   following the requirements of section 2333 of the Act.

   122.2. The maximum and minimum limits on compensation included in section 2333
   of the Act shall be determined by following the federal general pay scale when
   using section 5332 of title 5 of the United States Code, and by following the
   non-union, District career service (general) pay scale when using the District
   pay scale.

   122.3. A beneficiary or beneficiaries receiving death benefits are not
   entitled to continuation of pay pursuant to § 109 of this chapter.
   
   
   
   122.4 	When a beneficiary begins to receive compensation under this section,
   the Program shall notify the beneficiary of the condition(s) under which death
   benefits may cease, including upon the beneficiary’s marriage, re-marriage,
   or entering into a domestic partnership, or upon the beneficiary’s reaching
   eighteen (18) years of age, pursuant to section 2333 of the Act.

   122.5. On a regular basis, the Program may require a beneficiary to confirm
   his or her marital or domestic partnership status and age, and the Program may
   conduct any investigation necessary pursuant to § 102 to confirm this
   information.  Any beneficiary receiving death benefits under this section
   shall cooperate with such investigation by providing all relevant information
   that the Program requests and by notifying the Program when his or her
   eligibility for benefits under this section changes.  Failure to notify the
   Program when his or her eligibility for benefits under this section changes
   may result in the Program initiating overpayment proceedings pursuant to §
   142 of this chapter.
