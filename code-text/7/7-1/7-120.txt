                                  DC REGULATIONS

RECURRENCE OF INJURY (§ 7-120)

120.1. An employee who received indemnity compensation for which payments have
   ceased who suffers a recurrence of the same compensable injury must notify the
   Program in writing of the recurrence.  The employee shall provide notice of
   the recurrence within thirty (30) days of the recurrence or within thirty (30)
   days of when the claimant first became aware or reasonably should have become
   aware of the recurrence and its relationship to the original claim.

   120.2. An employee who reports a recurrence of an injury shall provide the
   Program with medical evidence that the recurrence is the same injury for which
   the claim was originally accepted, and shall follow all requirements in this
   chapter relevant to receiving benefits, including the requirements of §§ 123
   and 124 of this chapter.

   120.3. The Program shall begin paying the employee indemnity payments again
   if:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The employee’s notification to the Program of the recurrence meets the
   requirements of § 120.5; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The Program determines after considering all relevant factual evidence,
   including all relevant medical evidence received pursuant to §§ 123 and 124
   of this chapter that:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The injury is the same injury for which the claim was initially accepted; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The recurrence of the injury prevents the claimant from being able to work.

   120.4. The Program shall issue an NOD either awarding or denying the claim for
   a recurrence of injury within thirty (30) days of the Program’s receipt of
   the information required in § 120.2.  The Program may controvert a claim for
   a recurrence of injury pursuant to §§ 112.3 through 112.7 of this chapter.

   120.5. The Program shall not begin payment of indemnity compensation to the
   employee again if three hundred sixty-six (366) days or more has passed since:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The employee received a payment of compensation; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   A final order was issued by a judicial entity regarding the employee’s
   indemnity payments.
