                                  DC REGULATIONS

TIME FOR MAKING A CLAIM (§ 7-119)

119.1 	In order to be eligible to receive benefits pursuant to this chapter,
   an employee or an employee’s representative must file an initial claim for
   benefits within two (2) years after the date of the injury or death.

   119.2. The Program shall not accept any claim for benefits that is filed later
   than two (2) years after the date of the injury or death unless:
   
   
   
   (a) 	The official superior had actual knowledge of the injury or death within
   thirty (30) days of the injury or death; or
   
   
   
   (b) 	The employee suffered a latent injury and did not become aware of the
   causal relationship between the injury and his or her employment until after a
   period of time following the injury.  In this circumstance, the employee must
   file a claim within two (2) years after the employee became aware, or should
   have become aware after exercise of reasonable diligence, of the causal
   relationship between the injury and his or her employment.

   119.3. The time limitation of this section does not begin to run against:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   A minor until the minor reaches twenty-one (21) years of age or has a legal
   representative appointed;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   An individual adjudged incompetent until a legal representative is appointed;
   and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   An employee whose exceptional circumstances, as determined at the discretion
   of the Chief Risk Officer, justify the filing of a claim.

   119.4. In the event an injury results in death, a workers’ compensation
   claim that was timely filed for the initial injury satisfies the notice
   requirements for the death claim.
