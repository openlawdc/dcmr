INITIAL DETERMINATIONS (§ 7-111)

111.1. The Program shall make an ID on a newly filed claim within thirty (30)
   days of the date the claim was first reported to the Program.

   111.2. In making its ID, the Program shall consider all relevant evidence in
   the claim file, including all relevant medical evidence received pursuant to
   §§ 123 and 124 of this chapter.

   111.3. An ID may deny benefits, in whole or in part, based upon the following
   factors:
   
   
   
   (a)	The employee&#8217;s lack of a compensable injury pursuant to section 2302
   of the Act;
   
   
   
   (b)	The Program’s controversion of the claim for two (2) years, pursuant to
   § 112.7;
   
   
   
   (c)	The employee&#8217;s failure to cooperate with treatment or rehabilitation
   recommendations or with Program requirements for providing information; or
   
   
   
   (d)	Any other grounds, such as fraud, that reasonably demonstrate that the
   employee is not entitled to benefits under the Act.

   111.4. A new claim shall be denied or controverted when an employee fails to
   cooperate by following the procedures set forth in this chapter.

   111.5. The ID is effective unless the employee succeeds on a request for
   hearing as provided in this chapter, or unless one (1) of the following
   circumstances occurs:
   
   
   
   (a) 	The Program decides that the ID was issued in error; or
   
   
   
   (b) 	The Program receives additional information after issuance of the ID that
   requires the Program to issue an amended ID.

   111.6. If one (1) of the circumstances in § 111.5 occurs, the Program shall
   issue an amended NOD.

   111.7. The Program shall issue an amended NOD pursuant to § 111.5(b) if the
   Program determines that a claimant is entitled to benefits for an additional
   body part or injury that is related to the original injury claim.  A body part
   or injury shall be added to an accepted claim if the Program determines after
   considering all relevant factual evidence, including all relevant medical
   evidence received pursuant to §§ 123 and 124 of this chapter, that the 
   injury or injury to the body part is directly related to the original injury
   for which the claim was initially accepted.

   111.8. Before the Program may issue an amended NOD pursuant to § 111.7, the
   claimant shall provide notice of the additional body part or injury within
   thirty (30) days of the new injury or within thirty (30) days of when the
   claimant first became aware or reasonably should have become aware that an
   additional body part or injury is directly related to the original claim.

   111.9. A claimant seeking to amend an NOD pursuant to §§ 111.7 and 111.8
   shall make a claim for the additional body part or injury by completing a
   supplemental Form CA-7, Claim for Compensation, Part A, Employee Statement, in
   accordance with § 108.4 of this chapter; a Form 3, Physician’s Report of
   Employee’s Injury, pursuant to § 108.6; and any other medical or
   supplemental reports required pursuant to §§ 108.7 and 108.10.  The claimant
   shall return the forms to the Program within fifteen (15) days of the date
   from which the forms are mailed to the employee.

   111.10. If a claimant suffers a new injury or an injury to an additional body
   part pursuant to § 111.8 while at work, the claimant’s official superior
   shall fill out the forms required in §§ 107.4 through 107.7 within fifteen
   (15) days of the date from which the forms are mailed to the employer.

   111.11. The Program shall issue an amended NOD either awarding or denying the
   claim for an amended NOD within thirty (30) days of the Program’s receipt of
   all forms required pursuant to §§ 111.8 through 111.10.  The Program may
   controvert a claim for an amended NOD pursuant to §§ 112.3 through 112.7 of
   this chapter.
