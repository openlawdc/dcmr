LEAVE REINSTATEMENT OR BUY BACK (§ 7-110)

110.1. Once the Program accepts a claim for TTD, a claimant shall not be
   required to use his or her sick or annual leave while the claimant is not
   working as a result of the compensable injury, except as stated in § 109 of
   this chapter.

   110.2. A claimant whose TTD claim is accepted by the Program may have his or
   her leave hours reinstated or buy back his or her leave hours in the following
   circumstances:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The claimant’s disability exceeds fourteen (14) days or is followed by
   permanent disability and the claimant used three (3) days of sick, annual, or
   other leave during the first three (3) days of the injury, pursuant to § 109
   of this chapter;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The claimant used sick, annual, or other leave after the continuation of pay
   period and before the claimant’s claim was accepted; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Any other circumstance where the claimant used sick, annual, or other leave
   after a claim for TTD has been accepted, for example, for a doctor’s
   appointment or medical procedure related to the accepted claim.

   110.3. If the circumstances described in § 110.2(a) or (b) above exist, then
   sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) or, if the claimant is entitled to
   augmented pay pursuant to section 2310 of the Act, seventy-five percent (75%)
   of the claimant’s leave will be reinstated upon the acceptance of the claim.

   110.4. If the Program determines that a claimant is eligible to have leave
   reinstated pursuant to § 110.2(c), or that a claimant is eligible to buy back
   his or her leave for any reason, the Program shall send a form to the claimant
   that informs the claimant of the following:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The dates and hours of leave that the claimant is eligible to have reinstated
   or to buy back;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The cost of buying back the leave, which shall be the difference between
   sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) or, if the claimant is entitled to
   augmented pay pursuant to section 2310 of the Act, seventy-five percent (75%)
   and one hundred percent (100%) of the value of the leave; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   That the claimant will be required to sign the form and return it to the
   Program in order for his or her leave to be reinstated.

   110.5. Once the Program receives the form requested in § 110.4, the Program
   shall forward the form to the Office of Pay and Retirement Services in the
   Office of the Chief Financial Officer for processing.
