                                  DC REGULATIONS

REQUIRED NOTICE TO EMPLOYEES (§ 7-3206)

An employee shall provide at least ten (10) days prior written notice to his or
her employer of the employee’s planned use of paid leave, if the employee is
aware of the need to use such paid leave at least ten (10) days before the date
on which the paid leave is to be used.







If an employee becomes aware of the need to use paid leave less than ten (10)
days before the date on which the paid leave is to be used, the employee shall
provide written notice to the employer of the need to use the paid leave on the
day that the employee becomes aware of the need to use the paid leave or,
otherwise as early as possible.  If that day is not a business day for the
employer, notice shall be given on the next business day.







If the need to use paid leave is not foreseeable, the employee shall make an
oral request for paid leave prior to the start of the work shift for which the
paid leave is requested.







If an emergency prevents the employee from making prior notification to the
employer of the need to use paid leave, the employer shall be notified prior to
the start of the next work shift or within 24 hour of the onset of the
emergency, whichever occurs sooner.







An employee shall make a reasonable effort to schedule paid leave in a manner
that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer.  If paid leave is
requested in a non-emergency situation, the employee shall consult with the
employer regarding the date and time of the paid leave to be taken.
