LIMITATIONS ON USE OF PAID LEAVE (§ 7-3205)

An employee shall not use in any calendar year more paid leave accrued pursuant
to the Act than the maximum number of hours that the employee may accrue
annually pursuant to §3201 unless permitted to do so by the employer.







If mutually agreed to by both the employer and employee, an employee who chooses
to work additional hours or shifts in the employer’s same or next pay period
in lieu of hours or shifts missed shall not use leave accrued pursuant to the
Act in those hours or shifts; provided, however, that the employer does not
require the employee to work such additional hours or shifts.
