                                  DC REGULATIONS

FORM OF NOTICE TO EMPLOYERS (§ 7-3207)

The employer may prescribe a written notice form for the request of paid leave.
Such form shall require only the employee’s name, employee identification
number (if any), and minimal information needed (e.g., type of leave, or basic
reason for leave) to show that the request comes within the Act’s coverage,
and the date(s) and time of the paid leave to be taken.







The leave request form shall not be used as a substitute for medical
certification, unless such use is designated by the employer.







If the employer prescribes a form, but the form is not reasonably available to
the employee, the employee may provide written notice to the employer by setting
forth in writing the information required by §3207.1.







If the employer has not prescribed a form, the employee may provide written
notice to the employer by setting forth in writing the information required by
§3207.1.
