EFFECT ON CURRENT COMPENSATED LEAVE POLICIES (§ 7-3212)

An employer that has a paid leave policy, (for example, paid time off or

employee’s discretion, which allow the accrual and usage of leave that are at
least equivalent to the paid leave prescribed in the Act, shall not be required
to modify that policy







An existing compensated leave policy shall be presumed to be equivalent to
requirements of the Act if the policy allows the employee to:







Access and accrue compensated leave at the same rate or greater than the hours
of leave provided in § 3201 of this Chapter; or







Use the compensated leave for the same purposes as those set forth in § 3203.
