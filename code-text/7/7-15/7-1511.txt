                                  DC REGULATIONS

QUORUM (§ 7-1511)

1511.1. The applicable statutory requirements shall determine the number of
   members constituting a quorum for the transaction of Board business. A
   majority of members actually serving on the Board constitute a quorum when
   there are vacancies. Board business cannot be transacted until a quorum is
   present. For this purpose, “present” means (a) physically attending the
   meeting or (b) participating in the meeting via teleconference, via
   videoconference, or via other electronic means as the Board determines.

   1511.2. After a quorum is ascertained, the meeting shall proceed unless a
   Board member raises an objection that a quorum is not present, whereupon the
   Chairman shall direct the calling of the roll and shall announce the result.

   1511.3. Until a quorum is present, no debate or motion shall be in order
   except to recess to locate absent members.

   1511.4. After a recess to locate absent members, the roll shall be called
   again. If a quorum is not then present, the meeting shall be adjourned.

   1511.5. Except as set forth in § 1511.6 there is no quorum requirement for a
   meeting for standing or special Committee. Debates and motions are permitted.
   Actions proposed by the special Committee shall be ratified by a majority of
   the Board.

   1511.6. Meetings of the Investment Committee shall not commence until a quorum
   consistent with the requirements in § 1511.1.
