   must establish:
   
   
   
   (a)	that the additional evidence is material, and
   
   
   
   (b)	that there existed reasonable grounds for the failure to present the
   evidence while the case was before the Administrative Hearings Division or the
   Office of Workers&#8217; Compensation (depending on which authority issued the
   compensation order from which appeal was taken).

   264.2. Where a party satisfies the requirements of subsections 264.1(a) and
   (b), the Review Panel to which the appeal is assigned, at its sole discretion,
   may remand the case to Administrative. Hearings Division or the Office of
   Workers&#8217; Compensation for such further proceedings as the presiding
   Administrative Law Judge or claims examiner deems necessary.

   264.3. Upon remand pursuant to subsection 264.2 of this Chapter, and receipt
   of the additional evidence, the presiding Administrative Law Judge or claims
   examiner may make such modification to the original compensation order as the
   additional evidence warrants.

   264.4. Where an Administrative Law Judge or claims examiner issues a new or
   modified compensation order following remand under subsection 264.2, the
   Review Panel may reject the compensation order.

   264.5. A party may either apply to the Board for review of the new or modified
   compensation order (or the Panel&#8217;s decision to reject the compensation
   order) or request reinstatement of the party&#8217;s originally-filed
   Application for Review.

   264.6. Any request for reinstatement must be filed within thirty (30) calendar
   days of the Administrative Law Judge&#8217;s or claims examiner&#8217;s
   decision on remand, in the manner provided by section 258 for the review of an
   initial compensation order.
