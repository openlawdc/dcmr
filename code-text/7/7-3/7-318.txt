CONTRIBUTIONS (§ 7-318)

318.1. Pursuant to §3 of the Act, an employer is liable for contributions to
   the District Unemployment Fund if he or she employs one (1) or more
   individuals in any employment in the District of Columbia.

   318.2. All services in employment shall be presumed to be covered unless
   specifically excluded by §1(b) of the Act.

   318.3. Where facts are in dispute, the Director shall determine, in accordance
   with §1(b) of the Act, whether the services of an individual constitute
   employment and the identity of the employer of that individual.

   318.4. Where doubt exists between two (2) or more employers regarding which is
   the employer of an individual, an agreement may be made stipulating which
   employer shall file the return and make the contributions required by the Act.
   The Director shall consider the prior written agreement of the employers in
   determining who is the liable employer.

   318.5. Where an individual performs services in employment for two (2) or more

   District of Columbia or elsewhere.

   318.7. In determining where an individual&#8217;s service is localized, the
   Director shall balance the interest of a claimant in receiving benefits
   pursuant to the Act and the interest of an employer in making contributions to
   a single jurisdiction for all the services of an individual regardless of
   where the service is performed.
