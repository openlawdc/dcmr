MISCONDUCT (§ 7-312)

312.1. Pursuant to §10(b) of the Act, the Director shall disqualify for
   benefits any individual discharged for misconduct occurring in his/her most
   recent work. The nature of the disqualification shall be in accordance with
   §10(b) (1) or §10(b) (2) of the Act as defined in §312.3, §312.4, §312.5
   and §312.6 of this section.

   312.2. The party alleging misconduct shall have the responsibility to present
   evidence sufficient to support a finding of misconduct by the Director.

   312.3. For purposes of §10(b) (1) of the Act, the term &#8220;gross
   misconduct&#8221; shall mean an act which deliberately or willfully violates
   the employer&#8217;s rules, deliberately or willfully threatens or violates
   the employer&#8217;s interests, shows a repeated disregard for the
   employee&#8217;s obligation to the employer, or disregards standards of
   behavior which an employer has a right to expect of its employee.

   312.4. Gross misconduct may include, but is not limited to the following:
   
   
   
   a.	Sabotage;
   
   
   
   b.	Unprovoked assault or threats;
   
   
   
   c.	Arson;
   
   
   
   d.	Theft or attempted theft;
   
   
   
   e.	Dishonesty;
   
   
   
   f.	Insubordination;
   
   
   
   g.	Repeated disregard of reasonable orders;
   
   
   
   h.	Intoxication, the use of or impairment by an alcoholic beverage, controlled
   substance, or other intoxicant;

   j.	Willful destruction of property;
   
   
   
   k.	Repeated absence or tardiness following warning.

   312.5. For purposes of §10(b) (2) of the Act, the term &#8220;other than
   gross misconduct&#8221; shall mean an act or omission by an employee which
   constitutes a breach of the employee&#8217;s duties or obligations to the
   employer, a breach of the employment agreement or contract, or which adversely
   affects a material employer interest. The term &#8220;other than gross
   misconduct&#8221; shall include those acts where the severity, degree, or
   other mitigating circumstances do not support a finding of gross misconduct.

   312.6. Other than gross misconduct may include, but is not limited to the
   following:
   
   
   
   a.	Minor violations of employer rules;
   
   
   
   b.	Conducting unauthorized personal activities during business hours;
   
   
   
   c.	Absence or tardiness where the number of instances or their proximity in
   time does not rise to the level of gross misconduct;
   
   
   
   d.	Inappropriate use of profane or abusive language.

   312.7. If a violation of the employer&#8217;s rules is the basis for a
   disqualification from benefits pursuant to §10(b) (1) or §10(b)(2) the Act,
   the Director shall determine the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	That the existence of the employer&#8217;s rule was known to the employee:
   
   
   
   (b)	That the employer&#8217;s rule is reasonable; and
   
   
   
   (c)	That the employer&#8217;s rule is consistently enforced by the employer.

   312.8. In an appeal hearing, no misconduct shall be presumed. The absence of
   facts which affirmatively establish misconduct shall relieve a claimant from
   offering evidence on the issue of misconduct.

   312.9. In an appeal hearing, the persons who supplied the answers to
   questionnaires or issued other statements alleging misconduct shall be present
   and available for questioning by the adverse party.

   312.10. In an appeal hearing, prior statements or written documents, in the
   absence of other reliable corroborating evidence, shall not constitute
   evidence sufficient to support a finding of misconduct by the Director.
