                                  DC REGULATIONS

EMPLOYER REPORTS (§ 7-320)

320.1. All reports deemed necessary by the Director for the effective
   administration of the Act, pursuant to §§4(a) and 17 of the Act, shall be
   filed by employers upon forms supplied by the Director.

   320.2. Employer reports shall contain all information requested by the
   Director.

   320.3. Each employer shall, not later than the last day of the month following
   the close of each calendar quarter, make a report of and pay the contributions
   which shall have accrued with respect to wages paid during the quarter to the
   Director.

   320.4. The Director may extend the time for filing quarterly reports for all
   employers for a period of not more than thirty (30) calendar days if the
   Director finds that either the purposes of the Act would be defeated or the
   contribution rate appeal rights of employers established in §3(c) (10) of the
   Act would be unduly burdened or jeopardized by requiring timely filing of the
   quarterly reports.

   320.5. After making the findings specified in §320.4, the Director shall
   simultaneously publish notice of the extension of time to file
   employers&#8217; quarterly reports in a newspaper of general circulation in
   the District of Columbia and in the D.C. Register  at least twenty-one (21)
   days immediately preceding the last day of the month following the close of
   the calendar quarter.
