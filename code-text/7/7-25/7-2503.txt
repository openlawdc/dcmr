REPRESENTATION (ยง 7-2503)

2503.1. An applicant appearing or having the right to appear before the Board
   at a hearing shall have the right to be represented by an attorney or a
   non-legal representative of the applicant&#8217;s own choosing.

   2503.2. If it appears to the Board that the issue or facts in the matter
   before it are so involved or intricate that, in the interest of justice, or
   conservation of time, or of facilitating the preparation of an adequate
   record, an applicant should be represented by an attorney, the Board may urge
   the applicant to procure the services of any attorney, and, if agreeable with
   the applicant, it shall allow him or her a reasonable period of time in which
   to do so.

   2503.3. The Board shall, in any case in which an applicant represents himself
   or herself, or is represented by a non-legal representative, take such action
   as may reasonably be necessary to insure that all information material to the
   case be developed to the fullest extent possible, commensurate with the
   Board&#8217;s function of sitting as an impartial body.

   2503.4. Applicants, expert witnesses, and other persons giving testimony or
   having the right to appear before the Board shall have questions directed to
   them first by members of the Board, then followed by counsel or
   representatives for the applicant, or as may otherwise be determined.
