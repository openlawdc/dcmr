   if deemed to be in the best interests of the Board.
   
   
   
   1611.3   	An offeror may designate portions of its proposal to be confidential
   if they include proprietary information or contain sensitive personnel
   information.
   
   
   
   1611.4   	An unsolicited proposal shall be returned to an offeror, citing
   reasons, when the proposal:
   
   
   
   (a)	Does not meet the criteria in § 1612.1; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Is not deemed to be advantageous to the Board.
