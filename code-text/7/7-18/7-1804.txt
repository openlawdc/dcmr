MERIT, INCENTIVE AND OVERTIME PAY (ยง 7-1804)

1804.1. Merit increases (increases in base salary) shall be tied to
   performance ratings.

   1804.2. General equity standards and the following principles shall guide
   merit increases:
   
   
   
   (a)	Motivating and rewarding excellence and tangible results;
   
   
   
   (b)	Wherever possible, rewards shall be linked to measurable individual,
   departmental, or organizational objectives; and
   
   
   
   (c)	To the extent practicable, the performance management program implemented
   by the Retirement Board shall serve as the primary system for measuring
   performance and providing feedback to employees;

   1804.3. Annual salary adjustments shall be governed by a merit budget which
   shall be determined annually. The merit budget shall be based on competitive
   practices in the marketplace, the Retirement Board&#8217;s current competitive
   position, and the availability of funds appropriated for such purpose.

   1804.4. Incentive pay (monetary payments) shall be used to reward employees
   for strong performance and goal attainment.

   1804.5. Individual or work group incentive compensation adjustments may be
   authorized for outstanding performance, or as recognition for suggestions,
   work process improvements, or operational savings.

   1804.6. The incentive compensation program shall reward top performers for
   achievement of goals rather than development of competencies and shall consist
   of monetary payments and non-monetary awards, but shall not result in
   temporary or permanent adjustments in the employee&#8217;s base salary.

   1804.7. Overtime shall be governed by the Fair Labor Standards Act
   (&#8220;FLSA&#8221;) of 1938 (29 U.S.C. ยง 201, et seq.) which requires that
   all employees covered by minimum wage and overtime pay provisions
   (&#8220;non-exempt&#8221; employees) be paid at a rate of one-and-one-half

   hours in a workweek.

   1804.8. Compensatory time off in lieu of monetary overtime compensation may be
   authorized upon request by non-exempt employees. Compensatory time for
   non-exempt employees shall be granted at a rate of one-and-one-half hours for
   each hour worked for which overtime compensation is required under FLSA (29
   U.S.C. ยง 207).

   1804.9. Compensatory time for FLSA exempt employees may be authorized at a
   rate not to exceed one times the hours accrued for compensation purposes in
   excess of 40 hours per week at the sole discretion of the Retirement Board.

   1804.10. Exempt and non-exempt employees shall receive compensation for
   compensatory time earned but not taken either; (i) within one year (12 months)
   from the time such compensatory time is earned or, (ii) at the time of
   separation from the service of the Board, whichever occurs first.
