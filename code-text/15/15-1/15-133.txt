EXHIBITS (ยง 15-133)

133.1. All direct and rebuttal testimony shall be prepared in the form of
   written exhibits.

   133.2. All revisions and corrections to case-in-chief and rebuttal exhibits
   shall be presented by way of replacement pages and submitted no later than
   five (5) business days prior to the beginning of hearings. Only the correction
   of minor typographical errors shall be allowed after this period.

   133.3. The title of each exhibit shall state concisely what the exhibit
   contains.

   133.4. Exhibits containing prepared written testimony shall contain line
   numbers on each page, in the lefthand margin. All such testimony shall be
   authenticated by an appropriate affidavit of the witness. An exhibit
   containing rebuttal testimony shall also include the exhibit, page and line
   numbers of the evidence that it purports to rebut.

   133.5. Case-in-Chief exhibits and rebuttal exhibits shall be served on each
   party, and twenty (20) copies shall be filed with the Secretary for use by the
   Commission and its staff. In addition, one (1) copy shall be sent to the
   Commission&#8217;s General Counsel, and one (1) copy to each Commission agent
   and consultant previously identified by the Commission&#8217;s Secretary or
   General Counsel.

   133.6. Each party shall, for the formal record, submit by 10:00 a.m. on the
   first hearing date in each case one fully corrected set of its case-in-chief
   and rebuttal exhibits.

   133.7. Narrative testimony and exhibits shall be identified prior to filing as
   follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	The name of the party shall be set forth on each exhibit in the form of an
   acronym or initials (e.g., PEPCO, WGL, PC or OPC, C&#038;P, PSC, GSA, AOBA);
   
   
   
   (b)	When the document to be filed is the testimony of a witness, each set of
   the testimony shall, following the party&#8217;s initials, bear a letter (in
   upper case); thus, the first witness of the Company shall have his or her
   testimony identified, for example, as PEPCO (A); the second witness, PEPCO
   (B), and so on. Each witness shall retain the same letter, however, the first
   witness&#8217; second set of testimony shall be lettered (2A) and so on;
   
   
   
   (c)	If there is an exhibit attached on the testimony of the witness, that
   exhibit shall bear an Arabic number. Thus, the first exhibit of the first
   witness would be marked, for example, PEPCO (A)-1. His or her second exhibit
   shall be marked, for example, PEPCO (A)-2, and so on. Any exhibit attached to
   the second set of testimony of a witness would be marked, for example, PEPCO
   (2A)-1; and
   
   
   
   (d)	If there is no testimony submitted with the exhibit, then the exhibit
   shall merely bear the capitalized initials of the party and be numbered
   sequentially with Arabic numbers (e.g., PEPCO-1).

   133.8. The Commission may, at the hearing, sequentially number all exhibits by
   the insertion of a prefix number before the letters of the party.

   133.9. Not later than 10:00 a.m. of the morning of a hearing, there shall be
   provided to all parties, Commissioners and agents, a list of all
   cross-examination exhibits that the party proposes to introduce on the record.
   This list shall be accompanied by copies of those exhibits.

   133.10. As subsequent filings are made, the list of cross-examination exhibits
   shall be cumulatively updated. Any party proposing to use a document in
   examination of a witness shall have it marked for identification and shall
   distribute copies to the Commission, for the record, and to the parties by
   10:00 a.m. the day of the hearing.

   133.11. The list of cross-examination exhibits shall contain the following
   information:
   
   
   
   (a)	The caption and docket number of the case;
   
   
   
   (b)	A title showing the party proponent of the list and the date of the list
   and the date of the list it supersedes, if any;
   
   
   
   (c)	The designation of the document in letters and numbers as the first
   column; and
   
   
   
   (d)	A description of the document in the second column.

   133.12. Documents, including, cross-examination exhibits, containing allegedly
   confidential or proprietary information shall be identified with a title which
   is not confidential or proprietary, thus permitting reference to the document
   in a manner which does not raise confidentiality issues.
