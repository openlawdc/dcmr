   for the proposed action, address the cost of possible mitigation of such gases
   through control or compensation, and state whether and to what extent the
   expected emissions are within the limits established by any applicable laws or
   regulations.

   2108.3. Impacts of the items set forth in ยง 2108.1 shall be analyzed for all
   components at all stages of project life including the following:

   applicable regulations; and
   
   
   
   (c)	A statement of whether the required permit, license, or other such
   authority has been secured and, if not, why not.

   2108.6. The applicant shall indicate any steps taken, or to be taken, to
   mitigate the environmental impacts of the proposed action. These include steps
   taken either to comply with applicable regulations or to mitigate beyond the
   level required by regulations. Mitigation may include avoiding an impact
   altogether, minimizing an impact by limiting the scale of the action,
   rectifying an impact, reducing an impact through the addition of equipment or
   limitations on operations, or compensating for the impact. Any and all studies
   on mitigation must be made available as part of the EIS submission.

   2108.7. In the context of all applicable regulations, the EIS shall discuss
   whether there are any adverse effects from externalities on the public health,
   welfare, and safety of the citizens of the District of Columbia.

   2108.8. The EIS shall include evaluations of the full range of alternatives to
   the proposed action. The evaluation shall include, but is not limited to, a
   comparison of the environmental consequences of the alternative to that for
   the proposed action. The evaluation shall state the reasons the alternative
   was rejected in favor of the proposed action. At a minimum, the evaluation
   shall include the following alternatives:
   
   
   
   (a)	Alternative sites for the proposed action, including the alternative of
   building a stand-alone power plant inside or outside the District. For
   transmission lines, alternative routes are the alternative sites that must be
   evaluated;
   
   
   
   (b)	Alternative technologies for the proposed action, including supply-side
   and demand-side alternatives; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Alternative environmental control strategies for the proposed action. The
   strategies shall include the following:
   
   
   
   (1)	Alternative designs;
   
   
   
   (2)	Equipment configurations; and
   
   
   
   (3)	Operating plans.

   2108.9. The EIS shall include a statement as to whether the proposed action
   involves any irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources.
   
   
   
   Examples include the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	A commitment to use fossil fuels; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The use of previously undeveloped land for a power plant site or a
   transmission line right of way.

   2108.10. The EIS shall include an analysis indicating whether the proposed
   action results in a net environmental benefit. Both direct and indirect
   environmental impacts may be used in the demonstration. For direct
   environmental impacts, the most acceptable demonstration is that the proposed
   action, as compared to the current situation, actually leads to a reduction in
   environmental impacts. For indirect impacts, the EIS may demonstrate that
   environmental impacts are reduced for some other activity beyond the scope of
   the proposed action.
   
   
   
   Examples of an analysis of net indirect environmental benefits include the
   following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The purchase of air pollution offsets at another existing facility in the
   District of Columbia so that the proposed action results in a net reduction in
   the District of Columbia of some air pollutants; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The proposed facility providing fuel for electric or gas vehicles which,
   as compared to conventional vehicles, emit less air pollution; the net
   environmental impact would then be in the form of the reduction of air
   pollution emissions by displacing conventional vehicles with low-pollution
   vehicles.

   2108.11. The applicant shall submit an analysis of the cumulative risk of
   adverse health effects which includes the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Hazard Assessment: The hazard assessment identifies the pollutants that
   cause health risk concerns. The types of health risks that must be analyzed
   include the following:
   
   
   
   (1)	Cancer risks;
   
   
   
   (2)	Chronic non-cancer risks; and
   
   
   
   (3)	Acute non-cancer risks.
   
   
   
   (b)	Exposure Assessment: The exposure assessment identifies the population at
   risk and the extent of exposure. Conservative assumptions shall be used in the
   exposure assessment. Exposure via multiple pathways shall include the
   following:
   
   
   
   (1)	Inhalation;
   
   
   
   (2)	Ingestion; and
   
   
   
   (3)	Dermal contact.
   
   
   
   (c)	Risk Computation: The risk computation shall set the criteria by which
   risks will be judged. When technology-based or health-based standards are
   available from the District of Columbia or the federal government, then those
   standards set the criteria to be used in the risk computation. For cancer
   health risks, the applicant shall analyze the computed risk for cancer related
   health risks, against both a one in one hundred thousand and a one in one
   million standard;
   
   
   
   (d)	Cumulative Risk Computation: The applicant shall explain and justify the
   extent to which risks reflect any possible interaction of one pollutant with
   another or the possible accumulation of pollutants from the proposed action
   with existing sources of pollutants. At a minimum, the applicant shall
   accumulate the lifetime health risk by pathway for the most exposed individual
   for pollutants attributable to all facilities affected by the proposed action
   when operated to the maximum extent possible. The applicant shall inform the
   Commission with respect to any interaction with existing environmental impacts
   (or baseline conditions) which would aggravate or diminish the incremental
   environmental impact of the proposed action; and
   
   
   
   (e)	Uncertainty Assessment: The conservatism of the assumptions used in
   paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection shall be fully explained and
   justified.

   2108.12. In addition to the EIS submitted by the applicant, the Commission may
   employ, and other interested persons may retain, an independent technical
   agent to conduct an EIS. The independent technical agent shall perform the
   same analysis required of the applicant.
