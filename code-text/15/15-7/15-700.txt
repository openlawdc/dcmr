   700.2. The General Counsel shall be designated as the FOIA Officer of the
   Commission.

   700.3. Any person requesting copies of Commission records, or access to
   Commission records, pursuant to the FOIA, shall submit the request to the
   General Counsel.

   700.4. For the purposes of this chapter, a &#8220;request&#8221; means a
   single demand for any number of documents made at one time to the General
   Counsel.

   700.5. When a request is made in writing, both the envelope and the letter
   shall clearly indicate that the subject is a freedom of information request.

   700.6. While oral requests may be honored, a person may be asked to submit in
   writing a request for records not customarily made available.

   700.7. A request shall reasonably describe the desired record. Where possible,
   specific information regarding dates, files, titles, file designation, or
   other identifying information, shall be supplied.

   700.8. Where the information supplied by the requesting party is not
   sufficient to permit the identification and location of the record without an
   unreasonable amount of effort, the person requesting the record shall be
   contacted and asked to supply the necessary information. Every reasonable
   effort shall be made by the Commission&#8217;s employees to assist in the
   identification and location of requested records.

   700.9. Commission employees may continue to furnish to the public, informally
   and without compliance with these procedures, information and records which
   they customarily furnish in the regular performance of their duties.

   700.10. The Secretary of the Commission shall maintain for public inspection a
   FOIA Docket. Except as provided in §700.11 the docket shall contain the

   (f)	The amount of fees collected for services rendered.

   700.11. Where the release of the identity of the person requesting the record,
   or other identifying details related to the request would constitute a clearly
   unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, the Secretary shall delete
   identifying details from the copies of the documents maintained in the public
   files.

   700.12. On or before the 31st day of March of each calendar year, the

   search waived by the General Counsel.

   700.13. When a requested record has been identified and is available, the
   General Counsel shall notify the person requesting the record as to where and
   when the record is available for inspection or copies will be available. The
   notification shall also advise the person of any applicable fees.

   and shall include the following information:
   
   
   
   (a)	A reference to the specific exemption or exemptions authorizing the
   withholding of the record with a brief explanation of how each exemption
   applies to the record withheld and a statement of the public interest
   considerations which establish the need for withholding the record. Where more
   than one (1) record has been requested and is being withheld, the foregoing
   information shall be provided for each record withheld; and
   
   
   
   (b)	A statement of the appeal rights provided by the FOIA.

   700.15. When a request for records has been denied in whole or in part by the
   General Counsel the person requesting the record may, pursuant to D.C. Code
   §1-1527 (1981 Ed.), appeal the denial to the Mayor or may seek immediate
   judicial review of the denial in the Superior Court.

   700.16. If a requested record cannot be located from the information supplied
