                                  DC REGULATIONS

PURCHASE OF LIQUID-IMMERSED DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMERS (ยง 15-4301)

4301.1. This regulation applies to the electric utility that provides electric
   distribution service to the District of Columbia.

   4301.2. After January 1, 2009, and subject to reasonable commercial
   availability, the electric utility shall purchase liquid-immersed distribution
   transformers using the life-cycle cost methodology specified in Section 2,
   Efficiency Evaluation for Electric Utilities of NEMA Standards Publication TP
   1-2002.

   4301.3. Evaluation of Distribution Transformer Models:
   
   
   
   (a)	Within each capacity class or type of liquid-immersed distribution
   transformers, a reasonable number of commercially available models shall be
   evaluated and, except as provided in paragraph (b), the model in each such
   class or type with the lowest total owning costs as determined by the
   life-cycle cost methodology shall be selected for the purchase.
   
   
   
   (b)	If a utility is soliciting bids to supply multiple capacity classes or
   types of liquid-immersed distribution transformers under a single contract,
   models offered by a supplier in more than one capacity class or type may be
   combined for purposes of life-cycle cost evaluation, provided that the
   aggregation of models offered by a single supplier in such combined classes or
   types with the lowest total owning cost as determined by the life-cycle cost
   methodology conducted prior to contract award shall be selected for purchase.
   
   
   
   (c)	For purposes of this evaluation, all values for load losses and no-load
   losses shall be determined through the methods specified in the &#8220;Uniform
   Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Distribution
   Transformers,&#8221; Appendix A to Subpart K of 10 CFR, Part 431, as amended,
   which is incorporated by reference.
   
   
   
   (d)	For purposes of this evaluation, estimated values of energy and capacity
   shall be based upon the most current year available at the time of any bid
   solicitation. Nothing in this regulation shall require a utility to purchase
   any liquid-immersed distribution transformer that fails to meet federal energy
   efficiency standards specified in 10 CFR Part 431, as amended, which is
   incorporated by reference.

   4301.4. After January 1, 2010, and subject to reasonable commercial
   availability, the electric utility shall purchase liquid-immersed distribution
   transformers that meet or exceed the energy efficiency standards specified in
   the Department of Energy&#8217;s (&#8220;DOE&#8221;) final rules in Part 431
   of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
