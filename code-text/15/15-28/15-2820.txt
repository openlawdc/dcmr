2820.1. The District of Columbia Lifeline Service Program is a program
   designed to operate in conjunction with the Federal Lifeline Program, to
   provide a low monthly recurring rate to qualifying residential subscribers for
   basic local exchange service.

   2820.2. In order to qualify for the Lifeline service, customers must show that
   they either:
   
   
   
   (a)	Fall below the highest available income level authorized by the Federal
   Low Income Energy Assistance Program or 150% of the Federal Poverty income
   guidelines for a household of that size; or
   
   
   
   (b) 	Participate in one of the following federal assistance programs: 
   Medicaid; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; Supplemental Security
   Income; Federal Public Housing Assistance (Section 8); Low-Income Home Energy
   Assistance Program; National School Lunch Program’s free lunch program; or

   consistent with both FCC and Commission regulations.

   2820.4. Lifeline subsidies shall not be available to customers on a
   retroactive basis.

   2820.5. When the entity responsible for certifying Lifeline customers notifies
   an ETC that a list of customers no longer qualifies for Lifeline service and

   customers, the Lifeline rate will revert to the serving ETC’s standard
   tariffed retail rate.

   2820.6. Lifeline service is only available at the qualifying customer’s
   principal residence.  An applicant for Lifeline service may report only one

   Post office boxes are not acceptable designations of residence.  Where
   applicable, an apartment number must be provided.
