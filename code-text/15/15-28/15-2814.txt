                                  DC REGULATIONS

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DC USTF (§ 15-2814)

2814.1. The amount of contribution required from each local exchange carrier
   and VoIP 	service provider shall be based on the total revenues of the local
   exchange carrier and VoIP service provider for local telecommunications
   service or 	telecommunications service derived from end users in the District
   of Columbia as a percentage of all the local exchange carrier’s or VoIP
   service provider&#8217;s total 	retail revenues for local telecommunications
   or telecommunications services derived from end users in the District of
   Columbia for the previous twelve (12)-month period ending December 31.

   2814.2. For VoIP providers, local telecommunications services revenue shall be
   based on actual local telecommunications services revenue based on a
   customer’s primary place of use, a traffic study used to allocate revenues
   by jurisdiction, or the inverse of the FCC’s Federal Universal Service
   Fund’s safe harbor mechanism used to determine interstate and intrastate
   revenue.  For nomadic VoIP providers, a customer’s registered E911 location
   may serve as a proxy for the customer’s primary place of use.  Each VoIP
   provider shall identify whether its reported revenue is based on actual local
   telecommunications services revenue, a traffic study, or the FCC safe harbor
   mechanism.

   2814.3. The Fund Administrator shall, based on the amount to be contributed to
   the DC USTF, calculate the contribution required to be made to the Fund by
   each contributor, based on the fund level established by the Commission and
   the information provided pursuant to 15 DCMR § 2804.1.  If any annual
   contribution is less than or equals twelve dollars ($12), then the
   Administrator may waive the payment of this contribution.

   2814.4. Each local exchange carrier and VoIP service provider shall pay its
   contribution directly to the Fund Administrator on a monthly basis.  The check
   or other negotiable instrument shall be payable to the &#8220;DC USTF.&#8221; 
   The invoice or other request for DC USTF contributions shall be past due
   thirty (30) calendar days after the date on the invoice or other request for
   DC USTF contributions, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission.

   2814.5. Upon request by a local exchange carrier or VoIP service provider, the
   Fund Administrator may approve an alternative payment arrangement.

   2814.6. Interest shall be charged on any payment not received by the past due
   date at the rate of one and half percent (1.5 %) monthly.

   2814.7. All contributions and interest payments made to the DC USTF shall be
   deposited into the DC USTF account by the Fund Administrator.
