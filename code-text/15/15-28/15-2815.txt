RECOVERY OF CONTRIBUTIONS (§ 15-2815)

2815.1. A local exchange carrier may recover no more than the amount of its
   			contributions to the DC USTF from its non-Lifeline retail customers.

   2815.2. Prior to recovering its DC USTF contributions from its customers, a
   	local exchange carrier shall have a tariff specifying the charge to be
   	assessed, in accordance with the rules and Orders of the 	Commission.

   2815.3. The local exchange carrier shall ensure that any recovery from its
   	retail customers shall be in a fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory
   	manner.

   2815.4. The local exchange carrier shall also ensure that no over-recovery of
   	contributions occurs.  Any over-recovery of Fund contributions for the
   	preceding year shall be carried forward to the ensuing year and shall 	be
   included as a reduction in the calculation of the retail end-user 	recovery
   amount for the ensuing twelve (12)-month period of the 	local exchange
   carrier’s contributions.  Any under-recovery of 	contributions for the
   preceding year, may, at the option of the local 	exchange carrier, be
   recovered from the 	end-users within the 	following twelve (12) months.

   2815.5. In the event a local exchange carrier elects to recover its DC USTF
   	contributions from its customers, the amount of the recovery shall be
   	explicitly stated as a line 	item on its customers’ bills.
