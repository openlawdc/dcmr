PREINSTALLATION TESTS OF TEMPERATURE CORRECTING DEVICES (§ 15-2358)

2358.1. Each gas corporation shall test temperature correcting devices by
   driving the mechanism while the temperature sensor is immersed in a
   temperature bath containing a precision thermometer that has an accuracy of
   plus or minus one half of one degree Fahrenheit (± 0.5° F).

   2358.2. Each gas corporation shall apply specific, reasonably constant
   temperatures to the temperature sensor. The temperatures used may be the
   operating (flowing gas) temperature, ambient temperature, or an ice bath at
   thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit (32° F). The temperature sensor shall be tested
   at not less than two (2) points, preferably with temperatures at least twenty
   degrees Fahrenheit (20° F) apart.

   2358.3. At each temperature test point, the counter or calibrating mechanism
   shall be advanced a predetermined number of counts. The number of counts by
   which the corrected counter or calibrating mechanism has been advanced shall
   be recorded. The accuracy shall be calculated by comparing the number of
   counts that the corrected counter or calibrating mechanism has been advanced
   with the actual number of counts required for the temperature at which the
   test was made.

   2358.4. Electronic temperature correcting devices shall be calibrated
   following the manufacturer&#8217;s recommended procedures.
