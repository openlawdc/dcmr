                                  DC REGULATIONS

PREINSTALLATION ACCURACIES (§ 15-2360)

2360.1. All tolerances shall be interpreted as maximum permissible variation
   from the condition of zero (0) error. In making adjustments, no advantage of
   the prescribed tolerance limits shall be taken to set meters fast.

   2360.2. In the reading and recording of data the following standards shall
   apply:
   
   (a)	In any test or calibration, the devices or instruments used in the test or
   calibration shall be read to the maximum degree of readability;
   
   (b)	The degree of accuracy achieved in the calculations involved in
   determining the accuracy of a meter, prover, device, or instrument in any test
   or calibration shall be consistent with the purpose for which the resultant
   accuracy is to be used; and
   
   (c)	The final accuracy or proof shall be recorded to the nearest one half
   percent (0.5%).

   2360.3. The overall accuracy or proof of a meter and an associated device,
   which affects the meter readings for billing purposes, shall not be more than
   one half percent (0.5%) fast or more than one and a half percent (1.5%) slow.

   2360.4. Diaphragm meters shall not be placed or left in service unless found
   upon testing to comply with the following:
   
   (a)	The meter shall not be more than one half percent (0.5%) fast nor more
   than one and a half percent (1.5%) slow at check flow or at full rated flow;
   
   (b)	The proof at full rated flow shall not differ from the proof at check flow
   by more than one percent (1%); and
   
   (c)	When air is used for testing meters, the rate of flow shall be adjusted to
   compensate for the difference in the specific gravity of air and the specific
   gravity of gas.

   2360.5. Rotary tube meters shall be tested at not less than fifteen percent
   (15%) of full rated flow. A gas corporation shall not install a rotary meter
   which is more than one half percent (0.5%) fast or more than one and a half
   percent (1.5%) slow at the points of test.

   2360.6. Turbine type meters shall be tested at not less fifteen percent (15%)
   of full rated flow. The meters shall not be more than one half percent (0.5%)
   fast or more than one and half percent (1.5%) slow at the points of test.

   2360.7. Pressure correcting devices shall not be more than one half percent
   (0.5%) fast or more than one and a half percent (1.5%) slow in the pressure
   range for which the instrument is intended to be used.

   2360.8. Temperature correcting devices shall not be more than one half percent
   (0.5%) fast or more than one and a half percent (1.5%) slow at the points at
   which they are tested.

   2360.9. Timing devices shall not have an error of more than one fourth of one
   percent (0.25%).

   2360.10. Before a meter may be installed for revenue billing purposes the gas
   corporation shall inspect and test the meter, and adjust it if necessary, so
   that its proof is within the tolerances specified in this section.

   2360.11. New meters in Group I, as specified in § 2370.4, may be sample
   tested for proof in accordance with a gas corporation’s sample plan of
   testing, acceptable to the Commission.
