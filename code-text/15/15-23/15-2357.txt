                                  DC REGULATIONS

PREINSTALLATION TESTS OF PRESSURE CORRECTING DEVICES (§ 15-2357)

2357.1. While the pressure element is actuated, the mechanism may be driven
   either manually or by a motor. A dead weight tester or regulated air or gas
   pressure may be used to actuate the pressure element. If regulated air or gas
   pressure is used, a pressure gauge having an accuracy of plus or minus one
   fourth of one percent (± 0.25%) of full scale shall be used to indicate the
   pressure on the element.

   2357.2. Each gas corporation shall apply a specific pressure to the pressure
   element and the uncorrected counter or calibrating mechanism shall be advanced
   a predetermined number of counts. The number of counts by which the corrected
   counter or calibrating mechanism has been advanced shall be recorded. The
   accuracy shall be calculated by comparing the number of counts that the
   corrected counter or calibrating mechanism has been advanced with the actual
   number of counts required for the pressure at which the test was made.

   2357.3. Electronic pressure correcting devices shall be calibrated following
   the manufacturer&#8217;s recommended procedures.
