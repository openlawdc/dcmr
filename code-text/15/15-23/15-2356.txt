                                  DC REGULATIONS

PREINSTALLATION TESTS OF ROTARY METERS (ยง 15-2356)

2356.1. Rotary meters on which an original test record of the differential
   pressures is established, as soon as practicable after installation, may
   subsequently be tested by comparing the new differential pressures with the
   original test record. This subsequent test may be in place of normal testing
   with a bell prover or other approved working standard.

   2356.2. In establishing the original test record, the pressure differential
   shall be recorded at two (2) or more load levels, with the minimum being no
   less than twenty percent (20%) of the rated capacity at the operating pressure
   of the meter.

   2356.3. The meters shall be given a differential pressure test at least once
   every twenty-four (24) months unless covered under an approved in-service
   performance testing program.

   2356.4. When the test differential pressure differs from the original test
   record by more than fifty percent (50%), the meter shall not be used for
   measurement for revenue billing purposes until, by cleaning or repairing, the
   differential pressure is not more than fifty percent (50%) in excess of the
   original test record.

   2356.5. If the differential pressure cannot be brought within the above limits
   by cleaning or repairing, the meter shall be removed from service and replaced
   with an accurate meter.

   2356.6. The differential pressure test shall not be used as a periodic test on
   rotary meters having a rated capacity of less than eight hundred (800) cubic
   foot per hour (cfh), or on rotary meters on which the results of a
   differential pressure test would not be conclusive, such as meters connected
   to the following:
   
   (a)	Loads which are less than twenty percent (20%) for the rated capacity of
   the meters; or
   
   (b)	Rapidly fluctuating loads.
