                                  DC REGULATIONS

METERING TESTS (ยง 15-2352)

2352.1. Only authorized representatives of a gas corporation shall remove and
   set meters. Each gas corporation shall keep a record of the dates that each
   meter is set in and removed from service.

   2352.2. The test of any meter or associated devices, or both, shall consist of
   a comparison of its accuracy with the accuracy of the standards prescribed by
   the National Bureau of Standards or other methods specified in this chapter.

   2352.3. Testing equipment shall be of sufficient capacity and ranges to test
   meters or associated devices, or both, under the conditions specified in ยง
   2360.

   2352.4. Bell provers may be used to test diaphragm, rotary, and turbine type
   meters. A prover that is used to test rotary and turbine type meters shall be
   properly automated and have a satisfactory readout. The test shall consist of
   passing a specific volume of air through the prover and the meter. The
   accuracy or proof is either read or calculated from the prover scale or the
   readout.

   2352.5. Approved working standards other than bell provers may be used to test
   diaphragm, rotary, and turbine type meters.

   2352.6. The meter to be tested shall be connected to the approved working
   standard so that the same volume of air, either under pressure or vacuum,
   passes through both.

   2352.7. The uncorrected accuracy shall be calculated or read directly from the
   readout on the working standard. Corrections shall be made for pressure and
   temperature differentials between the meter under test and the working
   standard to determine the corrected accuracy.
