                                  DC REGULATIONS

BELL PROVERS (§ 15-2354)

2354.1. Each gas corporation testing meters with bell provers shall do the
   following:
   
   (a)	Own and maintain, or have access to, one (1) or more approved bell type
   meter provers of appropriate size, and all other equipment necessary to test
   meters, which shall be installed in the meter room;
   
   (b)	Provide the means to maintain the temperature of the liquid in the bell
   provers at substantially the same level as the air temperature in the prover
   room. The maximum difference in temperature shall not be more than two degrees
   Fahrenheit (2° F);
   
   (c)	Maintain each bell prover in good condition and correct adjustment shall
   be accurate within plus or minus three tenths of one percent (± 0.3%) at each
   point used in testing meters; and
   
   (d)	Calibrate each bell prover at least once every three (3) years. If moved
   or disassembled, the accuracy of a bell prover shall be determined by using
   one (1) or more of the methods as follows:
   
   (1)	By comparison to a one cubic foot (1 ft,³) cubic foot standard calibrated
   by the National Bureau of Standards;
   
   (2)	By strapping with a calibrated tape whose accuracy is traceable to the
   National Bureau of Standards; or
   
   (3)	By comparison to an approved transfer standard for a bell in excess of
   five cubic feet (5 ft.3).

   2354.2. Each gas corporation testing meters by standards other than bell
   provers shall do the following:
   
   (a)	Test meters which are too large for testing on a five cubic foot (5 ft.3)
   bell prover by other approved methods and by use of approved working
   standards;
   
   (b)	Maintain the approved working standards in good condition and correct
   adjustment, with a high degree of repeatability, and capable of determining
   the actual proof of the meter under test to within plus or minus five tenths
   of one percent (± 0.5%) at rates of flow between fifteen percent (15%) and
   one hundred percent (100%) of rated capacity of the meter under test; and
   
   (c)	Test the approved working standards for accuracy by comparison with an
   acceptable standard at least once every three (3) years.

   2354.3. Each standard shall be accompanied at all times by a certificate or
   calibration card, duly signed and dated, on which are recorded the corrections
   required to compensate for errors found at the customary test points at the
   time of the previous test.
