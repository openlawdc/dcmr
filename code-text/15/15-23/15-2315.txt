   Company&#8217;s gas procurement strategies and practices.

   2315.2. The GPR shall contain the following information:
   
   (a)	Actual and projected annual and monthly gas supply, billing determinants
   and costs, including weighted average cost of gas, as allocated to major
   classes of service by jurisdiction;
   
   (b)	Actual and projected margins for sales to flex rate interruptible and
   special contract customers;
   
   (c)	An outline of the efforts made to obtain and maintain a reliable gas
   supply at reasonable costs; and
   
   (d)	An outline and discussion of the decision-making basis and planning
   procedures utilized by WGL in its gas procurement activities.

   2315.3. The GPR shall consist of at least four (4) sections which address the
   directives in Commission Order No. 9793, as well as other considerations
   agreed upon by the members of the Gas Procurement Working Group (GPWG). The
   GPWG, which shall consist of representatives from the Staff of the Commission

   days from the date of the GPR&#8217;s submission to the Commission.

   a report to the Commission summarizing and evaluating the comments of public
   parties and OPC and providing its recommendations.

   2315.7. WGL should submit reply comments, if any, not later than fifteen (15)
   days from the submission of comments of OPC, Staff, or the public.

   2315.8. The Commission shall review the GPR, along with any public comments,
