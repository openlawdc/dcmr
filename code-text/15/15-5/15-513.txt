                                  DC REGULATIONS

FORMULATION OF A PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (§ 15-513)

513.1. PEPCO shall develop and submit to the Commission annually on February
   15th a proposed Productivity Improvement Plan (PIP) for the calendar year
   which sets cost-effective productivity improvement goals for the company to
   attempt to achieve by the end of that year.

   513.2. The company&#8217;s proposed plan shall identify those operating
   factors and practices contributing to productivity loss; assess the
   feasibility of taking specific cost-alternative productivity improvement
   measures; and propose those productivity improvement measures which will yield
   net benefits to District rate-payers (i.e., cost-effectiveness, or the net
   benefit-cost determination, is to be based on a total net incremental revenue
   requirement effect, either over the short or long run, depending on the
   specific productivity improvement under consideration).

   513.3. The company&#8217;s plan shall also include estimates of the capital
   and operating costs necessary to achieve productivity improvements, estimate
   the cost savings anticipated for productivity improvements, and identify the
   company&#8217;s plans for decreased use of scarce fuels and effective
   preventive and outage maintenance (both short- and long-term).

   513.4. The company&#8217;s plan shall include historical statistics for the
   past ten (10) years by unit for PEPCO, and aggregated by size and type of unit
   for the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) interconnection and for the
   North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), and shall include a
   forecast for the current year for PEPCO, of the following information:
   
   
   
   (a)	Total production expense (cents per kWh);
   
   
   
   (1)	Fuel and purchased power (cents per kWh);
   
   
   
   (2)	Salaries (cents per kWh);
   
   
   
   (3)	Other operations and maintenance (cents per kWh);
   
   
   
   (b)	Power plant productivity;
   
   
   
   (1)	Heat rate (BTU kWh);
   
   
   
   (2)	Availability (percent);
   
   
   
   (3)	Equivalent availability factor (percent);
   
   
   
   (4)	Equivalent forced outage factor (percent);
   
   
   
   (5)	Capacity factor (percent);
   
   
   
   (c)	Fuel procurement effectiveness (cents per MBTU as burned);
   
   
   
   (1)	Coal;
   
   
   
   (2)	Heavy oil;
   
   
   
   (3)	No. 2 fuel oil;
   
   
   
   (4)	Natural gas;

   513.5. At an early stage in the company&#8217;s development of its proposed
   productivity improvement plan, it is to establish a Productivity Improvement
   Working Group (PIWG) consisting of PEPCO technical staff representatives, the
   People&#8217;s Counsel, and three (3) members of the Commission staff; one
   each from the Accounting, Economics and Engineering Division.

   513.6. The primary purpose of the PIWG shall be to provide a mechanism through
   which Commission staff and the People&#8217;s Counsel can communicate with the
   company while the PIP is in the developmental stage. However, the PIWG shall
   not formulate the PIP.

   513.7. The group shall review and discuss the results of company productivity
   investigations and possible areas for productivity improvement. In addition,
   the group shall transfer technical knowledge to the staff which will
   ultimately assist in the Commission&#8217;s review and evaluation of the
   company&#8217;s productivity improvement proposals, and thereby provide a
   sound technical knowledge foundation for an effective monitoring of the PIP.

   513.8. The public shall have forty-five (45) days from the date of its
   submission to the Commission to comment on the company&#8217;s proposed PIP.

   513.9. The staff shall review the proposed PIP and by May 1st shall submit a
   report to the Commission summarizing and evaluating the comments of public
   parties, and providing its recommendations as to the proposed PIP. The
   staff’s report shall also contain, for the initial PIP filing only, a
   proposed plan for Commission approval which establishes staff’s procedural
   plan for monitoring the company&#8217;s productivity improvement progress
   under the PIP.

   513.10. The Commission shall review the company&#8217;s plan, along with the
   staff report and all public comments, and make public its evaluation of the
   company&#8217;s plan by June 1st.
