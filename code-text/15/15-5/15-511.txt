                                  DC REGULATIONS

ANNUAL PROJECTIONS (ยง 15-511)

511.1. The company shall submit to the Commission on February 15th of each
   year a forecast of fuel costs, power plant operating parameters, and its
   planned maintenance budget and timetable for each month of the forecast year.

   511.2. Forecasts shall be developed for each generating unit and for
   PEPCO&#8217;s entire generating system of the following generating system
   operating performance indices:
   
   
   
   (a)	Operating availability factor;
   
   
   
   (b)	Equivalent availability factor;
   
   
   
   (c)	Capacity factor;
   
   
   
   (d)	Heat rate;
   
   
   
   (e)	Forced outage rate;
   
   
   
   (f)	Equivalent forced outage rate;
   
   
   
   (g)	Planned outage rate; and
   
   
   
   (h)	Maintenance outage rate.

   511.3. Forecasts shall be made of fuel prices, consumption and expenditures by
   fuel type and quality for each generating plant and for the total PEPCO
   system, and of the company&#8217;s planned maintenance budget and timetable.

   511.4. All forecasts shall be accompanied by upper and lower limit forecast
   bounds (i.e., a forecast band). The range of this band shall reflect the
   potential variations from forecast values which may result from unanticipated
   but reasonable divergencies from expected performance under normal operating
   conditions.

   511.5. Prior to the development of the forecasts, PEPCO shall submit a
   forecast procedure explaining its preferred methodology for computing forecast
   values.

   511.6. Staff shall review this approach and the specific forecast method that
   the company follows. The forecasts are not to be strictly historically based;
   they should incorporate expected improvements in operating performance over
   the forecast period.
