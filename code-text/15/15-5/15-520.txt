                                  DC REGULATIONS

REPORTS REQUIRED IN SECOND AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS (§ 15-520)

520.1. The company shall provide a written report by February 15th of each
   year that examines and explains in detail the reasons for operating
   performance results outside the ranges forecast in the company&#8217;s prior
   year report concerning its annual projections of monthly fuel prices,
   consumption and expenditures, generating system operating performance and
   maintenance budget, and timetable.

   520.2. In addition to this report, after the first six (6) months of data
   becomes available and again upon the filing of the annual PIP on February
   15th, the company shall submit another report to the Commission identifying
   and discussing in detail the factors responsible for its progress or lack of
   progress toward meeting the prior year&#8217;s productivity improvement
   objectives.

   520.3. In the second year and in each year thereafter, the staff shall prepare
   a report for the Commission summarizing the company&#8217;s operating
   performance over the first six (6) months under the FAC, and shall again as
   part of its annual PIP report do the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Provide an analysis of the company&#8217;s progress in meeting its
   productivity improvement goals; and
   
   
   
   (b)	 Evaluate PEPCO&#8217;s operating performance under the FAC over the
   previous twelve (12) months.

   520.4. The staff may recommend that the particular operating performance
   should be investigated further by the Commission. (This recommendation would
   not necessarily presume that imprudent management decisions were the cause of
   the abnormal performance, but would suggest to the Commission that the company
   should thoroughly reveal the reasons for its performance to the
   Commission&#8217;s satisfaction).

   520.5. If the Commission finds that further investigation is unnecessary, the
   staff’s request shall be denied. However, if the Commission is not satisfied
   with the company&#8217;s explanation of its performance a further
   investigation (which may include an evidentiary hearing) shall be undertaken.
