MONITOR AND EVALUATION (§ 15-512)

512.1. The staff of the Commission shall synthesize and evaluate the
   information required by this chapter to determine the reasons for changes in
   levels, fluctuations, and trends in specific plant and system operating
   parameters and expenditures.

   512.2. This evaluation process shall include on-site inspections of company
   generating facilities, and discussions with PEPCO fuel procurement, planning
   and operating personnel on fuel data availability, potential areas for
   productivity improvements and statistical procedures used in forecasting fuel
   costs, interchange activity and plant operating performance parameters.

   512.3. The staff shall report to the Commission on the feasibility and
   cost-effectiveness of computerizing some parts of the audit and review
   program.

   512.4. The feasibility of computerizing fuel information reports shall be
   assessed (computerization would require computer-compatible formatting or
   reporting forms) and alternative computer programs shall be examined to
   determine which one(s) may better assist the staff in audit and review
   activities.

   512.5. A decision shall then be made on the manner and extent of computer
   processing which is appropriate for the staff’s monitoring activities.
