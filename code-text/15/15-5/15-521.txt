RATE CASE SCRUTINY (ยง 15-521)

521.1. The company shall justify the continued use of its fuel adjustment
   clause in each rate filing. The burden of proof shall rest on the company to
   show the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	That fuel costs are being optimized;
   
   
   
   (b)	That generating facilities are operating at reasonable efficiency;
   
   
   
   (c)	That fuel price and interchange cost volatility continues to be a factor
   supporting the continued need for a fuel adjustment clause; and
   
   
   
   (d)	That removal of the fuel adjustment clause would adversely impact on the
   company&#8217;s profitability and as a result lead to higher electric rates.

   521.2. As a result of evidence gathered in an investigation, the Commission
   may order the company to modify or withdraw its fuel adjustment clause or
   decide to leave the existing clause unaltered. The Commission shall, in its
   discretion, undertake evidentiary investigations more frequently than in every
   rate proceeding.
