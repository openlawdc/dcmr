   or some portion thereof, of rearrangement of facilities in the following
   circumstances:
   
   
   
   (a)	Where the utility needs to use the facilities being used by a cable
   operator for the utilities&#8217; own needs; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Where leasing to another party would produce a net benefit, as determined
   by the Commission, to utility ratepayers in the District of Columbia.

   1613.4. In determining usable space on a pole, the utility shall adhere to the
   applicable codes governing ground clearance and safety zones.

   1613.5. When determining the amount of space on a pole to be assigned to a
