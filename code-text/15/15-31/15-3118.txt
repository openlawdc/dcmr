3118.1. Except to the extent otherwise permitted by applicable law (and after
   receiving the District&#8217;s approval, to the extent the District is
   exercising such authority pursuant to applicable law), a cable operator shall
   not discriminate among subscribers with respect to fees, charges, deposits and
   other terms and conditions affecting any service, or any equipment,
   installation or any other activity subject to regulation under Section 623 of
   the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. ยง 543)(or any successor thereto) and the rules and
   regulations issued in connection therewith. All such fees, charges, deposits
   and other terms and conditions must be applied fairly and uniformly to all
   subscribers in the cable operator&#8217;s franchise area.

   3118.2. Nothing contained in subsection 3118.1 shall prohibit a cable operator
   from offering, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
   
   
   
   (a)	Discounts to senior citizens or economically disadvantaged groups;
   
   
   
   (b)	Different charges for residential subscribers than for non-residential
   subscribers;
   
   
   
   (c)	Sales promotions and other discounts or reduced charges for a reasonable
   period of time, which are offered to all residential subscribers or all
   non-residential subscribers, as the case may be, for the same length of time
   although the start date of such promotions, discounts or reduced charges may
   be staggered such that the offer may begin for the last subscriber to whom
   they are offered up to six (6) months after the start date for the first
   subscriber to whom they are offered;
   
   
   
   (d)	Sales promotions and other discounts or reduced charges, which are offered
   to a class of subscribers to whom one (1) of the cable operator&#8217;s
   competitors has offered similar promotions, discounts or reduced charges, but
   only for the same period of time as the competitor&#8217;s offering;
   
   
   
   (e)	Sales promotions and other discounts or reduced charges, which are offered
   to a discrete class of subscribers and which may affect the fees, charges,
   deposits and other terms and conditions for such subscribers for a period not
   to exceed eight (8) months, provided that the Company may apply to OCT for a
   waiver of such maximum period;
   
   
   
   (f)	Bulk rates; or
   
   
   
   (g)	Other special, short-term discounts or reduced charges to identifiable
   classes of subscribers or potential subscribers for reasonable categories of
