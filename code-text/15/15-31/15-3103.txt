EQUIPMENT PROVIDED BY A CABLE OPERATOR (ยง 15-3103)

3103.1. A cable operator shall make available necessary equipment for
   subscribers to utilize services provided by a cable operator, such as
   converters and remote control devices. A cable operator shall supply a
   parental control device upon request at a charge consistent with the cable
   operator&#8217;s applicable franchise agreement and applicable law.

   3103.2. At a subscriber&#8217;s request, a cable operator shall exchange
   faulty converters at the subscriber&#8217;s address without charge. In such
   cases, the cable operator shall provide another converter, install it, and
   ensure that it is working properly.

   3103.3. A cable operator may require a refundable, nondiscriminatory deposit
   for equipment provided to subscribers, and the deposit shall be placed in an
   interest- bearing account.

   3103.4. A cable operator shall refund a deposit made by a subscriber, plus
   actual interest accrued pursuant to subsection 3103.3, within thirty (30) days
   after disconnection of service and the return of equipment.

   3103.5. A cable operator shall make available arrangements for the return of
   equipment at the subscriber&#8217;s address, such as pickup upon
   disconnection, or a satisfactory equivalent, such as the provision of a
   postage-prepaid mailer, and permit the return of equipment to a customer
   service center within thirty (30) days after the disconnection of services or
   by the last date the subscriber occupies the address (whichever is earlier). A
   cable operator shall give the subscriber a receipt showing the date and time
   of the return of the equipment. When equipment is returned, a cable operator
   shall promptly test the equipment to determine damage. Otherwise, subsequent
   claims of damages shall be deemed waived.

   3103.6. In the event a subscriber does not cooperate with a cable
   operator&#8217;s reasonable efforts to recover equipment, a cable operator may
   require the subscriber to return the equipment at a customer service center.

   3103.7. A cable operator may hold a subscriber at fault for unreturned
   equipment if, within the time set forth in subsection 3103.5:
   
   
   
   (a)	The subscriber refused to make or keep arrangements for equipment pickup
   at the subscriber&#8217;s address;
   
   
   
   (b)	The subscriber failed to avail themselves of alternative arrangements for
   the return of equipment; or
   
   
   
   (c)	The subscriber failed to return the equipment to a customer service
   center..

   3103.8. A cable operator may charge the subscriber or deduct from the
   subscriber&#8217;s deposit the depreciated value of the equipment if equipment
   is lost, damaged, or stolen.

   3103.9. If a cable operator seeks to charge the subscriber for lost, stolen,
   or damaged equipment, the cable operator shall give a written notice to the
   subscriber of the amount charged.

   3103.10. A cable operator shall keep records showing the resolution of
   subscriber claims regarding lost, stolen, or damaged equipment.

   3103.11. In addition to the total amount of a refund due to a subscriber, if a
   cable operator fails to pay a refund due a subscriber, within forty-five (45)
   days of the disconnection of service and the return of equipment, the cable
   operator shall make an additional payment to the subscriber equal to 20% of
   the amount owed. A cable operator shall issue additional payments to the
   subscriber equal to 20% of the amount owed for each additional thirty (30)
   days that the refund remains outstanding.

   3103.12. A cable operator shall provide free demonstrations of equipment at a
   cable operator&#8217;s customer service center(s) on an ongoing basis and at
   the subscriber&#8217;s address at the time of installation.

   3103.13. Consistent with federal law, a cable operator shall allow the
   connection or use of authorized navigation devices (for example, converters
   and interactive equipment), provided that the equipment does not cause harm to
   the cable system and is not used for unauthorized access to the cable system
   and its services.
