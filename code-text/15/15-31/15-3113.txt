   notice if a subscriber has damaged, destroyed, or unlawfully tampered with the
   cable operator&#8217;s cable system; a subscriber receives unauthorized
   service from a cable operator; or where a cable operator detects signal
   leakage that is originating from the subscriber&#8217;s address in excess of
   federal limits, provided that the cable operator has first attempted to repair
   the leakage without terminating service.

   3113.13. In cases of signal leakage, a cable operator may temporarily
   disconnect service while it corrects the signal leakage problem. The cable
   operator shall immediately notify the subscriber of the termination and
   leakage problem. Once the problem is corrected, a cable operator shall
   immediately reconnect the subscriber without charge.

   3113.14. If a subscriber voluntarily disconnects service and a cable operator
