618.1. If a PSP fails to adhere to the provisions of this Chapter, the
   Commission may suspend service to that instrument and may order the
   termination of service to the PSP&#8217;s other pay telephones until such time
   as the pay telephone(s) is brought into compliance.

   618.2. For violation of both §§ 601.1 and 604.1 (an unregistered pay
   telephone by a non certified owner), the Commission will terminate service to
   the pay telephone immediately without prior notice to the owner.

   618.3. For violation of § 604.1, the Commission will give the PSP thirty (30)
   days&#8217; notice to correct the problem before taking action to suspend
   service to the pay telephone.

   618.4. For violation(s) of § 606.1, the Commission will give the PSP thirty
   (30) days&#8217; notice to correct the problem before taking action to suspend
   service to the pay telephone.

   618.5. For violations(s) of two (2) or more operational infractions in §
   609.1 or five (5) or more signage infractions in § 609.2, the Commission will
   give the PSP thirty (30) days&#8217; notice to correct the problem before
   taking action to suspend service to the pay telephone.

   618.6. The Commission will take action to suspend service immediately unless
   the PSP notifies the Commission in writing that it has cured the violations
   before the expiration of the thirty (30) day notice period.

   618.7. Notwithstanding § 618.5, all infractions listed in § 609.1 and §
   609.2 must be cured by the pay telephone provider after receiving notice from
   the Commission of the violations. Failure to correct violations after the
   sixty (60) days&#8217; notice letter may result in suspension of dial tone to
   the pay telephone unless the PSP notifies the Commission in writing that the
   violations have been cured before the expiration of the sixty (60) day notice
   period.
