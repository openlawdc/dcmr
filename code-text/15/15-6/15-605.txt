COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE INSTALLATION OF A PAY TELEPHONE (§ 15-605)

605.1. Any interested party may challenge a Registration Application by filing
   a written complaint with the Commission within forty-five (45) days of the
   date that notice of the Registration Application is served pursuant to §
   604.8.

   605.2. The Commission&#8217;s Office of Consumer Services shall, within five
   (5) days, serve a copy of the complaint on OPC and the PSP seeking to register
   the pay telephone.

   605.3. The Commission shall not approve a Registration Application if the
   Commission finds, pursuant to § 614, that the pay telephone would constitute
   a public nuisance or significantly contribute to criminal activity in the
   surrounding community.

   605.4. For a period of five (5) years, the Commission shall not approve a
   Registration Application for any pay telephone that is proposed to be located
   within a one (1) block radius of another pay telephone location against which
   a complaint is pending. When the Commission has ordered the removal of a pay
   telephone because the pay telephone has been found by the Commission, or its
   designee, to have constituted a public nuisance or significantly contributed
   to criminal activity in the surrounding community, the Commission shall not
   approve a Registration Application for any pay telephone that is proposed to
   be located within a one (1) block radius of the location of the removed pay
   telephone.

   605.5. The Commission shall not approve a Registration Application until all
   of the PSP&#8217;s existing pay telephones are in compliance with the
   provisions of § 609, entitled Pay Telephone Services.

   605.6. If no opposition to the Registration Application is received within the
   time period set forth in § 605.1, and if the installation of the pay
   telephone is not otherwise barred under § 605.4, the application shall be
   approved.

   605.7. Notwithstanding any other provision of these rules, the Commission, in
   order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the
   District of Columbia, may reject any request for registration of a pay
   telephone, or may approve any registration subject to conditions imposed on
   the operation of the instrument.
