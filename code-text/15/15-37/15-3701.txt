REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERVICE OUTAGES AND GAS INCIDENTS (§ 15-3701)

3701.1. The natural gas utility shall report to the  Commission and  the
   Office of the People’s Counsel (OPC) of the District of Columbia all major
   and non-major natural gas service outages, as well as incidents that result in
   the loss of human life, personal injury requiring hospitalization, property
   damage of over $5,000, or service disruption directly or indirectly arising
   from or connected with the gas utility’s maintenance or operation, that
   occur on the natural gas system within the District of Columbia. Additionally,
   the natural gas utility must include in its operating, maintenance procedures,
   and emergency plan that it will utilize industry standard testing procedures,
   such as conducting metallurgical or laboratory analysis of failed components,
   to identify the root causes of natural gas service outages and to minimize the

   utility’s dispatch has been informed of a major service outage, with as much
   detailed information as possible.  To the extent all information required by
   Section 3701.3 is not available at the time of the initial communication, the
   natural gas utility shall within two (2) hours of the dispatch supplement its
   initial report with the additional information.  This reporting requirement
   applies to business and non-business hours.

   service outage.  The utility shall provide an update to OE and OPC prior to
   making any changes to its estimated restoration time.

   3701.5. Estimated restoration information, if available, shall be provided to
   District of Columbia customers by the utility’s customer service
