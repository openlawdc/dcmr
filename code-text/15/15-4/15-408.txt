PETITIONS FOR APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER (ยง 15-408)

408.1. If less than all of the tenants have elected to receive service in
   their own names, the utility shall have the right to petition the Superior
   Court for the appointment of a receiver for those tenants who decline to
   receive service in their own names.

   408.2. If it is not practicable for tenants to receive service in their own
   names, or if tenants elect not to receive service in their own names, or if
   tenants fail to respond to the Notice of Tenants Rights and Options, the
   electric or gas utility shall not terminate service to a master-metered
   apartment building on the basis of non-payment of a delinquent account but the
   utility or tenants may petition the Superior Court of the District of Columbia
   for appointment of a receiver of the rents for that apartment house who shall
   pay the prospective utility bills from the rent collected.
