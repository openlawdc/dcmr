                                  DC REGULATIONS

RESPONSE REQUIRED FROM EVERY TENANT (ยง 15-407)

407.1. In cases where the utility company has indicated that individual
   metering of less than the entire building is not feasible and all the tenant
   responses indicated that they wish to receive service in their own name and to
   have installed at their own expense individual meters, the utility shall make
   an effort to contact every tenant who has not responded.

   407.2. This effort pursuant to ยง407.1 shall include at least two (2) attempts
   to contact those tenants on the telephone and where both those attempts fail,
   a field representative shall make a personal visit to the tenant&#8217;s
   apartment.

   407.3. If no contact is made during the visit either with the tenant or any
   other responsible person on the premises, a field representative shall leave a
   notice reasonably calculated to be seen by the person residing in the
   apartment stating that the tenant should contact the utility within three (3)
   working days if he or she wishes to receive service in his or her own name.

   407.4. In those instances where it is &#8220;practicable&#8221; to provide
   individual meters for the entire building and all tenants have not agreed to
   accept service by individual meters in their own names within ten (10) days
   from the delivery of the Statement of Practicability the individual meter
   option shall be revoked. Tenants may still receive service in their own name
   individually under the utility&#8217;s fair and equitable share proposal, as
   approved by the Commission.
