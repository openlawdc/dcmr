TENANT PAYMENT OF UTILITY BILL (ยง 15-406)

406.1. Tenants who elect to have their units individually metered at their own

   proposal shall pay their utility costs directly to the utility company.

   406.2. If a tenant who has agreed to accept responsibility for payment of his
   or her utility costs later defaults on the payment of his or her utility bill,
   the utility companies may terminate the service to the individual using the
   same method as is employed for other consumers.

   406.3. If a tenant association which has agreed to accept responsibility for
   payment of the apartment&#8217;s utility costs later defaults on the payment
   of the apartment&#8217;s utility bill, the utility company may move
   immediately to appoint a receiver and the tenants shall remain individually
   liable for their fair and equitable share of the utility costs throughout this
   period.
