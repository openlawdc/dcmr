PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY (ยง 15-400)

400.1. The purpose of this chapter shall be to establish procedures to
   prohibit termination of electric and gas utility services to master-metered
   apartment buildings.

   400.2. Tenants shall be provided the opportunity to take on prospective
   financial responsibility for the utility services pursuant to the provisions
   of this chapter. In addition, tenants and utilities may petition the Superior
   Court of the District of Columbia for the appointment of a receiver.

   400.3. This chapter shall apply to all electric and gas utilities under the
   jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission that supply services to
   master-metered apartment buildings and have actual or constructive knowledge
   that the tenants of the apartment house are not persons to whom the utility
   sends its bills.

   400.4. The utility shall be considered to have constructive knowledge whenever
   a single original bill is sent for a particular utility service supplied to an
   entire apartment house. The mailing of duplicate copies of the original bill
   shall not negate this single bill status.
