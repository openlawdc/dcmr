                                  DC REGULATIONS

TENANTS&#8217; RIGHTS (ยง 15-401)

401.1. A gas or electric utility shall not terminate service to any
   master-metered apartment building on the basis of non-payment of a delinquent
   account by the owner, agent, lessor or manager (herein referred to as the
   &#8220;owner&#8221;) unless that utility provides an opportunity, where
   practicable, for the tenants to assume prospective financial responsibility
   for the utility services furnished by receiving service in their own names,
   either individually or collectively, on the same terms as any other customer
   and without any liability for the amount due while service was billed directly
   to the owner.

   401.2. As used in this section, the terms &#8220;where practicable&#8221;
   means when the utility finds either that it is feasible to individually meter
   each apartment involved or that it is feasible to divide the total utility
   bill among the tenants in a fair and equitable manner. It shall be
   &#8220;practicable&#8221; to offer tenants an opportunity to receive service
   collectively when there is a group or association of tenants which is willing
   to accept responsibility for collecting and paying the entire bill.

   401.3. Any determination made by the utility that the opportunity for a tenant
   to receive service in his or her own name is not practicable shall be
   appealable by that tenant to the Public Service Commission within ten (10)
   working days of the posting of the Statement of Practicability.

   401.4. The Public Service Commission shall, within five (5) working days from
   the date of the appeal, make the final determination of whether or not the
   utility&#8217;s decision was correct. An appeal shall only be taken by tenants
   residing in the apartment at the time the notice is posted.
