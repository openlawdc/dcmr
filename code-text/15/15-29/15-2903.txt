                                  DC REGULATIONS

CREATION AND TRACKING OF RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDITS (§ 15-2903)

2903.1. RECs shall be created and tracked through the PJM Environmental
   Information Service GATS (PJM-EIS GATS) beginning January 1, 2006. The
   accumulation of RECs derived from generation occurring prior to the date of
   January 1, 2006, is not permissible.

   2903.2. Behind-the-Meter generators with a capacity of less than ten kilowatts
   (10 kW) may submit engineering based estimates of their output if the
   generator is not directly metered by a revenue grade utility meter.  For solar
   thermal energy systems that do not generate electricity:
   
   
   
   (a)	If the output is to be estimated, the Commission will provide PJM-EIS with
   the output in kilowatt-hour savings for the system, based on SRCC’s
   estimated annual system performance of OG-300 certified systems; or
   
   
   
   (b)	If the solar thermal energy system uses an energy meter that meets the
   performance standards established by OIML, then the solar thermal energy
   produced by the system shall be credited with one kilowatt hour (1 kWh) of
   electricity generated for each three thousand four hundred twelve British
   thermal units (3,412 BTUs) produced by the solar thermal energy system.

   2903.3. RECs created by behind-the-meter generators must be recorded in GATS
   at least once each calendar year in order to be eligible for compliance.

   2903.4. RECs shall be valid for a three (3)-year period from the date of
   generation beginning January 1, 2006, except where precluded by statute. The
   last business day of January of each year shall be the deadline for the
   creation of RECs for the previous year, subject to further changes in GATS
   provisions.

   2903.5. A REC shall be retired after it is used to comply with any
   state&#8217;s Renewable Energy Portfolio requirement.

   2903.6. Retroactively created RECs must be created and tracked through PJM-EIS
   GATS.
