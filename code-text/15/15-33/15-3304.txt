REVOCATION OF CHANNELS (ยง 15-3304)

3304.1. Subject to a notice and an opportunity to cure, OCT may revoke a
   channel allocation at any time and pursuant to these rules and the applicable
   PEGOA if OCT finds that such channel has been operated in violation of these
   rules, the District&#8217;s cable law, or the applicable PEGOA.

   3304.2. If OCT decides to revoke a channel allocation, it shall provide a
   notice in writing to the channel operator stating in detail the violations and
   how they can be cured. The notice shall provide a period of not less than 30
   days for the entity to cure such violations.

   3304.3. OCT may hold a hearing and receive testimony regarding the proposed
   revocation of a channel. OCT shall publish a notice of such public hearing in
   the District of Columbia Register.

   3304.4. If a channel operator has fully cured the violations to OCT&#8217;s
   satisfaction within the requisite period, OCT shall cease the revocation
   process; otherwise, OCT shall issue an order revoking the channel designation.

   3304.5. The revocation of a channel shall not serve as a permanent bar against
   the allocation of a channel to such operator, except that the circumstances of
   the revocation may be considered by OCT if the operator reapplies for a
   channel.

   3304.6. Within seven (7) days of revoking any channel, OCT shall notify cable
   and open video system operators in the District to cease including such
   channel as one of the District&#8217;s PEG channels.
