                                  DC REGULATIONS

INTENT AND POLICY (§ 15-3300)

3300.1. Pursuant to section 803 of the Cable Television Reform Amendment Act
   of 2002, effective October 9, 2002 (D.C. Law 14-193; to be codified at D.C.
   Official Code § 34-1258.03 et seq.), this chapter establishes the rules for
   the allocation of public, educational, and government (PEG) cable television
   channels, whether analog, digital, or other type, provided by a cable
   television system operator or an open video system operator in the fulfillment
   of its obligations under a franchise agreement or any other agreement.

   3300.2. It is the intent of the Office of Cable Television (OCT) to insure
   that all PEG channels be effectively used by the District, through qualified
   entities, to serve the residents of the District and provide them with
   valuable information as well as provide a forum for public expression and
   debate of public issues through the medium of cable television.

   3300.3. The failure of OCT or any entity to comply with these rules shall in
   no circumstances release, or be construed as releasing, a cable television
   system operator or an open video system operator from its obligations,
   including its obligation to transmit PEG channels, under its franchise
   agreement or any other agreement with the District
