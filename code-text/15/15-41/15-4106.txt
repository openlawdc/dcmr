                                  DC REGULATIONS

FINANCIAL CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS (§ 15-4106)

4106.1. Financial capability requirements shall be imposed on wholesale
   suppliers of SOS and shall be consistent with provisions established herein.

   4106.2. Each wholesale SOS provider shall obtain and file with the Commission
   a bond, a letter of credit, or a corporate guarantee that will provide
   assurances of financial integrity and funding for replacement service in the
   event that the wholesale provider fails to provide for uninterrupted service. 
   If a corporate guarantee is obtained, it must conform to the
   Commission-approved form.

   4106.3. The amount of the financial capability requirement for the wholesale
   SOS provider in the Electric Company’s service territory shall be equal to
   fifteen (15) percent of the wholesale SOS provider’s bid obligation for the
   SOS class(es) the provider is awarded, and expected to serve, in the Electric
   Company’s service territory.

   4106.4. The amount of the financial capability requirement shall be
   commensurate with the remaining outstanding bid obligation of the wholesale
   SOS provider throughout the term of the SOS provider’s awarded contract
   period, and reduced annually from the initial amount determined at the
   beginning of the term of the wholesale SOS’s provider’s service.

   4106.5. The proceeds of the bond, or letter of credit, or corporate guarantee,
   as necessary, shall be payable to the Electric Company to whom the wholesale
   bidder is obligated to provide service.  The proceeds of the bond, letter of
   credit, or corporate guarantee shall be used only to defray the additional
   costs of replacement SOS in the event of interrupted service.  For purposes of
   this provision, additional costs are all costs that are incurred or will be
   incurred to acquire replacement SOS, including supply and administrative
   costs, through the remaining SOS term that exceed the amounts paid or to be
   paid by SOS customers at the SOS rates in effect at the time of the
   Commission’s declaration of a wholesale provider’s default.

   4106.6. A corporate guarantee permitted by Sections 4106.2, 4106.3, and
   4106.4, may be issued by an affiliate of the wholesale SOS provider or a third
   party that meets the financial credit requirements set forth in Sections
   4106.2, 4106.3, and 4106.4.
   
   
   
   (a)	The corporate guarantee must meet all of the requirements of Sections
   4106.2, 4106.3, and 4106.4, and shall be unconditional and irrevocable and
   provide for payment within five (5) business days for the period of the
   standard offer term.
   
   
   
   (b)	A corporate guarantee may be used to satisfy the requirement of Sections
   4106.2, 4106.3, and 4106.4, if the corporate guarantor meets the following
   financial qualifications and capabilities:
   
   
   
   (1)	The senior unsecured debt obligations of the guarantor are publicly rated,
   at a minimum, &#8220;BBB-&#8221; from S&#038;P or Fitch, or &#8220;Baa3&#8243;
   from Moody&#8217;s;
   
   
   
   (2)	The total assets of the guarantor are at least 5.0 times the amount of the
   corporate guarantee amount required by Sections 4106.2, 4106.3, and 4106.4;
   and
   
   
   
   (3)	The total common equity of the guarantor is at least 2.5 times the amount
   of the corporate guarantee amount required by Sections 4106.2, 4106.3, and
   4106.4.
   
   
   
   (c)	If a corporate guarantor&#8217;s senior unsecured debt obligations are
   rated by: (i) two of the agencies listed in Section 4106.6(b)(1), the
   guarantor&#8217;s rating will be determined by the lower assigned rating; or
   (ii) all three of the agencies listed in Section 4106.6(b)(1), two of those
   agencies must have assigned ratings equal to or higher than the required
   ratings described above.
   
   
   
   (d)	If, at any time, the senior unsecured debt obligations of the corporate
   guarantor fail to meet the requirements of Section 4106.6(b), the corporate
   guarantor or the SOS wholesale provider shall immediately notify the
   Commission in writing.
   
   
   
   (e)	If the corporate guarantor fails to meet any of the financial capability
   requirements, the Commission may, at its option, require the SOS provider to
   post a bond or file a letter of credit as described in Sections 4106.2,
   4106.3, and 4106.4.

   4106.7. If at any time during the term of the supplier agreement between the
   Wholesale SOS Provider and the Electric Company, the Electric Company’s
   credit rating is downgraded below investment grade, as defined in Section
   4199, the Wholesale SOS Provider has the right to require the Electric Company
   to make payments to the Wholesale SOS Provider on an accelerated basis during
   the downgrade period.  Payments made under the acceleration clause may be made
   on a weekly basis.
