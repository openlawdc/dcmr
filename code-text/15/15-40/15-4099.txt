   Electric Distribution System in the event of an Emergency Condition for as
   long as the Party determines it is reasonably necessary in the event one or
   more of the following conditions or events occurs:
   
   
   
   3.4.1	Emergency Conditions &#8211; Emergency Conditions shall mean any
   condition or situation: (1) that in the judgment of the Party making the claim
   is reasonably likely to endanger life or property; or (2) that, in the case of
   the EDC, is reasonably likely to cause an Adverse System Impact; or (3) that,
   in the case of the Interconnection Customer, is reasonably likely (as
   determined in a non-discriminatory manner) to cause a material adverse effect
   on the security of, or damage to, the Small Generator Facility or the
   Interconnection Equipment. Under Emergency Conditions, the EDC or the
   Interconnection Customer may immediately suspend interconnection service and
   temporarily disconnect the Small Generator Facility. The EDC shall notify the
   Interconnection Customer promptly when it becomes aware of an Emergency
   Condition that may reasonably be expected to affect the Interconnection
   Customer&#8217;s operation of the Small Generator Facility. The
   Interconnection Customer shall notify the EDC promptly when it becomes aware
   of an Emergency Condition that may reasonably be expected to affect the
   EDC&#8217;s Electric Distribution System. To the extent information is known,
   the notification shall describe the Emergency Condition, the extent of the
   damage or deficiency, the expected effect on the operation of both
   Parties&#8217; facilities and operations, its anticipated duration, and the
   necessary corrective action.
   
   
   
   3.4.2	Scheduled Maintenance, Construction, or Repair &#8211; The EDC may
   interrupt interconnection service or curtail the output of the Small Generator
   Facility and temporarily disconnect the Small Generator Facility from the
   EDC&#8217;s Electric Distribution System when necessary for scheduled
   maintenance, construction, or repairs on the EDC&#8217;s Electric Distribution
   System. The EDC shall provide the Interconnection Customer with five business
   days notice prior to such interruption. The EDC shall use reasonable efforts
   to coordinate such reduction or temporary disconnection with the
   Interconnection Customer.
   
   
   
   3.4.3	Forced Outages &#8211; With any forced outage, the EDC may suspend
   interconnection service to effect immediate repairs on the EDC&#8217;s
   Electric Distribution System. The EDC shall use reasonable efforts to provide
   the Interconnection Customer with prior notice. If prior notice is not given,
   the EDC shall, upon written request, provide the Interconnection Customer
   written documentation after the fact explaining the circumstances of the
   disconnection.
   
   
   
   3.4.4	Adverse Operating Effects &#8211; The EDC shall provide the
   Interconnection Customer with a written notice of its intention to disconnect
   the Small Generator Facility if, based on the operating requirements specified
   in Attachment 3, the EDC determines that operation of the Small Generator
   Facility will likely cause disruption or deterioration of service to other
   customers served from the same electric system, or if operating the Small
   Generator Facility could cause damage to the EDC&#8217;s Electric Distribution
   System. Supporting documentation used to reach the decision to disconnect
   shall be provided to the Interconnection Customer upon written request. The
   EDC may disconnect the Small Generator Facility if, after receipt of the
   notice, the Interconnection Customer fails to remedy the adverse operating
   effect within a reasonable time unless Emergency Conditions exist in which
   case the provisions of Article 3.4.1 apply.
   
   
   
   3.4.5	Modification of the Small Generator Facility &#8211; The interconnection
   customer shall provide written notification to the EDC before making any
   modifications to the small generator facility. The EDC will determine if the
   modifications are minor or non-minor in nature. Written authorization from the
   EDC is required for non- minor changes if the EDC determines that the
   interconnection customer&#8217;s modifications could cause an Adverse System
   Impact. If the interconnection customer makes such modifications without the
   EDC&#8217;s prior written authorization the EDC shall have the right to
   temporarily disconnect the small generator facility until such time as the EDC
   reasonably concludes the modification poses no threat to the safety or
   reliability of its electric distribution system.
   
   
   
   3.4.6	Reconnection &#8211; The Parties shall cooperate with each other to
   restore the Small Generator Facility, Interconnection Facilities, and
   EDC&#8217;s Electric Distribution System to their normal operating state as
   soon as reasonably practicable following any disconnection pursuant to this
   section; provided, however, if such disconnection is done pursuant to Article
   3.4.5 due to the Interconnection Customer&#8217;s failure to obtain prior
   written authorization from the EDC for Non- Minor Equipment Modifications, the
   EDC shall reconnect the Interconnection Customer only after determining the
   modifications do not impact the safety or reliability of its Electric
   Distribution System.

   Upgrades

   6.1. Assignment
   
   
   
   This Agreement may be assigned by either Party upon fifteen (15) business days
   prior written notice, and with the opportunity to object by the other Party.
   Should the Interconnection Customer assign this agreement, the EDC has the
   right to request that the assignee agree to the assignment and the terms of
   this Agreement in writing. When required, consent to assignment shall not be
   unreasonably withheld; provided that:
   
   
   
   6.1.1	Either Party may assign this Agreement without the consent of the other
   Party to any affiliate (which shall include a merger of the Party with another
   entity), of the assigning Party with an equal or greater credit rating and
   with the legal authority and operational ability to satisfy the obligations of
   the assigning Party under this Agreement;
   
   
   
   6.1.2	The Interconnection Customer shall have the right to assign this
   Agreement, without the consent of the EDC, for collateral security purposes to
   aid in providing financing for the Small Generator Facility, For Small

   the building or property will result in an automatic transfer of this
   agreement to the new owner who shall be responsible for complying with the
   terms and conditions of this Agreement.
   
   
   
   6.1.3	Any attempted assignment that violates this Article is void and
   ineffective. Assignment shall not relieve a Party of its obligations, nor
   shall a Party&#8217;s obligations be enlarged, in whole or in part, by reason
   thereof. An assignee is responsible for meeting the same obligations as the
   Interconnection Customer.

   6.2. Limitation on Damages
   
   
   
   Except for cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, the liability of
   any Party to this Agreement shall be limited to direct actual damages, and all

   gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall any Party or its directors,
   officers, employees and agents, or any of them, be liable to another Party,
   whether in tort, contract or other basis in law or equity for any special,
   indirect, punitive, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost
   profits, lost revenues, replacement power, cost of capital or replacement
   equipment. This limitation on damages shall not affect any Party&#8217;s
   rights to obtain equitable relief, including specific performance, as
   otherwise provided in this Agreement. The provisions of this Article 6.2 shall
   survive the termination or expiration of the Agreement.

   6.3. Indemnity
   
   
   
   6.3.1	This provision protects each Party from liability incurred to third
   parties as a result of carrying out the provisions of this Agreement.
   Liability under this provision is exempt from the general limitations on
   liability found in Article 6.2.
   
   
   
   6.3.2	The Parties shall at all times indemnify, defend, and hold the other
   Party harmless from, any and all damages, losses, claims, including claims and
   actions relating to injury to or death of any person or damage to property,
   demand, suits, recoveries, costs and expenses, court costs, attorney fees, and
   all other obligations by or to third parties, arising out of or resulting from
   the other Party&#8217;s action or failure to meet its obligations under this
   Agreement on behalf of the indemnifying Party, except in cases of gross
   negligence or intentional wrongdoing by the indemnified Party.
   
   
   
   6.3.3	Promptly after receipt by an indemnified Party of any claim or notice of
   the commencement of any action or administrative or legal proceeding or
   investigation as to which the indemnity provided for in this Article may
   apply, the indemnified Party shall notify the indemnifying Party of such fact.
   Any failure of or delay in such notification shall not affect a Party&#8217;s
   indemnification obligation unless such failure or delay is materially
   prejudicial to the indemnifying Party.
   
   
   
   6.3.4	If an indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this
   Article as a result of a claim by a third party, and the indemnifying Party
   fails, after notice and reasonable opportunity to proceed under this Article,
   to assume the defense of such claim, such indemnified Party may at the expense
   of the indemnifying Party contest, settle or consent to the entry of any
   judgment with respect to, or pay in full, such claim.
   
   
   
   6.3.5	If an indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify and hold any
   indemnified Party harmless under this Article, the amount owing to the
   indemnified person shall be the amount of such indemnified Party&#8217;s
   actual loss, net of any insurance or other recovery.

   6.4. Force Majeure
   
   
   
   6.4.1	As used in this Article, a Force Majeure Event shall mean any act of
   God, labor disturbance, act of the public enemy, war, acts of terrorism,
   insurrection, riot, fire, storm or flood, explosion, breakage or accident to
   machinery or equipment through no direct, indirect, or contributory act of a
   Party, any order, regulation or restriction imposed by governmental, military
   or lawfully established civilian authorities, or any other cause beyond a
   Party&#8217;s control. A Force Majeure Event does not include an act of gross
   negligence or intentional wrongdoing.
   
   
   
   6.4.2	If a Force Majeure Event prevents a Party from fulfilling any
   obligations under this Agreement, the Party affected by the Force Majeure
   Event (Affected Party) shall promptly notify the other Party of the existence
   of the Force Majeure Event. The notification must specify in reasonable detail
   the circumstances of the Force Majeure Event, its expected duration, and the
   steps that the Affected Party is taking and will take to mitigate the effects
   of the event on its performance, and if the initial notification was verbal,
   it should be promptly followed up with a written notification. The Affected
   Party shall keep the other Party informed on a continuing basis of
   developments relating to the Force Majeure Event until the event ends. The
   Affected Party shall be entitled to suspend or modify its performance of
   obligations under this Agreement (other than the obligation to make payments)
   only to the extent that the effect of the Force Majeure Event cannot be
   reasonably mitigated. The Affected Party shall use reasonable efforts to
   resume its performance as soon as possible.

   6.5. Default
   
   
   
   6.5.1	No default shall exist where such failure to discharge an obligation
   (other than the payment of money) is the result of a Force Majeure Event as
   defined in this Agreement, or the result of an act or omission of the other
   Party.
   
   
   
   6.5.2	Upon a default of this Agreement, the non-defaulting Party shall give
   written notice of such default to the defaulting Party. Except as provided in
   Article 6.5.3 the defaulting Party shall have 60 calendar days from receipt of
   the default notice within which to cure such default; provided however, if
   such default is not capable of cure within 60 calendar days, the defaulting
   Party shall commence such cure within 20 calendar days after notice and
   continuously and diligently complete such cure within six months from receipt
   of the default notice; and, if cured within such time, the default specified
   in such notice shall cease to exist.

   any subcontractor as it deems appropriate to perform its obligations under
   this Agreement; provided, however, that each Party shall require its
   subcontractors to comply with all applicable terms and conditions of this
   Agreement in providing such services and each Party shall remain primarily
   liable to the other Party for the performance of such subcontractor.
   
   
   
   9.10.1	The creation of any subcontract relationship shall not relieve the
   hiring Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement. The hiring Party
   shall be fully responsible to the other Party for the acts or omissions of any
   subcontractor the hiring Party hires as if no subcontract had been made. Any
   applicable obligation imposed by this Agreement upon the hiring Party shall be
   equally binding upon, and shall be construed as having application to, any
   subcontractor of such Party.
