CERTIFIED INTERCONNECTION EQUIPMENT (ยง 15-4002)

4002.1. Interconnection equipment shall be deemed certified with this Chapter
   upon establishment of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The interconnection equipment has been tested in accordance with the
   appropriate codes and standards referenced in this Chapter by any nationally
   recognized testing laboratory (&#8220;NRTL&#8221;) recognized by the United
   States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) to
   test and certify interconnection equipment pursuant to the relevant codes and
   standards listed in Section 4002.4.
   
   
   
   (b)	The interconnection equipment has been labeled and is publicly listed by
   such NRTL at the time of the interconnection application.
   
   
   
   (c)	The interconnection customer verifies that the intended use of the
   interconnection equipment falls within the use or uses for which the
   interconnection equipment is labeled, and is listed by the NRTL.

   4002.2. If the interconnection equipment is an integrated equipment package
   such as an inverter, then the interconnection customer shall show that the
   generator or other electric source being utilized is compatible with the
   interconnection equipment and is consistent with the testing and listing
   specified for this type of interconnection equipment.

   4002.3. If the interconnection equipment includes only interface components
   (switchgear, multi-function relays, or other interface devices), then an
   interconnection customer shall show that the generator or other electric
   source being utilized is compatible with the interconnection equipment and is
   consistent with the testing and listing specified for this type of
   interconnection equipment.

   4002.4. To meet the requirements for certification, interconnection equipment
   shall be evaluated by an NRTL in accordance with the following codes and
   standards:
   
   
   
   (a)	IEEE 1547.1 Standard for Conformance Tests Procedures for Equipment
   Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Underwriters Laboratories (&#8220;UL&#8221;), UL 1741 Inverters,
   Converters, and Controllers for Use in Independent Power Systems;

   4002.5. The interconnection equipment shall meet the requirements of the most
   current approved version of each document listed in Section 4002.4, as amended
   and supplemented at the time the interconnection request is submitted for
   certification.

   4002.6. Certified interconnection equipment shall not require further design
   testing or production testing, as specified by IEEE Standard 1547 Sections 5.1
   and 5.2, or additional interconnection equipment modification to meet the
   requirements. However, nothing herein shall preclude the need for an onsite
   Witness Test or operational test by the interconnection customer.
