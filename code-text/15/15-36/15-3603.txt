RELIABILITY STANDARDS (§ 15-3603)

3603.1. The electric utility shall implement a plan to improve the performance
   of the two (2) percent least performing feeders such that no feeder in the two
   (2) percent least performing group shall repeat as a member of the two (2)
   percent least performing feeders following implementation of the plan.

   3603.2. Individual feeder performance shall be determined using the
   utility&#8217;s composite performance index.

   3603.3. If the utility fails to comply with Section 3603.1, it shall be
   required to develop a corrective action plan.

   3603.4. The corrective action plan shall clearly describe the cause(s) of the
   utility&#8217;s non-compliance with Section 3603.1 (including an explanation
   as to why a particular feeder has remained on the list after the
   implementation of the plan in 3603.1), describe the corrective measure(s) to
   be taken to ensure that the standard is met or exceeded in the future, and
   provide a target date for completion of the corrective measure(s).

   3603.5. The utility shall report on the progress of the corrective action plan
   in the Annual Consolidated Report submitted to the Commission.

   3603.6. The utility shall continue the current reporting of the worst
   performing (lowest two (2) percent) feeders (utility methodology) and
   corresponding corrective action plans, with the action taken in year 1 and the
   subsequent performance in year 2 in the annual Consolidated Report.

   3603.7. The utility shall complete service restoration within twenty-four (24)
   hours following a non-major service outage.

   3603.8. The utility shall report on the number and percentage of non-major
   service outages that extend beyond the twenty-four (24) hour standard and the
   reasons each such outage extended beyond the twenty-four (24) hour standard.

   3603.9. The report drafted pursuant to Section 3603.8 shall be included in the
   annual Consolidated Report on reliability data.

   3603.10. The utility shall not exceed the reliability performance standards
   established for the following indices, calculated using District of Columbia
   data: System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) and System Average
   Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) (stated in hours).

   3603.11. The reliability performance standards adopted by the Public Service
   Commission for SAIDI and SAIFI are established as follows:
   
   (a)	For 2013, SAIDI shall be two and sixty-eight hundredths (2.68) and SAIFI
   shall be one and thirteen hundredths (1.13);

   shall be one and five hundredths (1.05);
   
   
   
   (d)	For 2016, SAIDI shall be two (2.00) and SAIFI shall be one and two
   hundredths (1.02);
   
   
   
   (e)	For 2017, SAIDI shall be one and eighty-one hundredths (1.81) and SAIFI
   shall be ninety-eight hundredths (0.98);
   
   
   
   (f)	For 2018, SAIDI shall be one and sixty-five hundredths (1.65) and SAIFI
   shall be ninety-five hundredths (0.95);
   
   
   
   (g)	For 2019, SAIDI shall be one and forty-nine hundredths (1.49) and SAIFI
   shall be ninety-two hundredths (0.92); and
   
   
   
   (h)	For 2020, and thereafter, SAIDI shall be one and thirty-five hundredths
   (1.35) and SAIFI shall be eighty-nine hundredths (0.89).

   3603.12. The calculations of the indices shall exclude District of Columbia
   OMS data for either Major Service Outages or for Major Event Days (MEDs). No
   later than January 1, 2013, the utility shall notify the Commission which
   method of excluding OMS data it will use and shall not change its selection
   without prior authority from the Commission. Major Event Days shall be
   determined in a manner consistent with the I.E.E.E. Standard 1366-2003 Guide

   utility’s failure to comply with subsection 3603.10, describe the corrective
   measure(s) to be taken to ensure that the standard is met or exceeded in the
   future, and provide a target for completion of the corrective measure(s).

   3603.15. The utility shall report on the progress of the corrective action
   plan in the following year’s Consolidated Report submitted to the
   Commission.

   3603.16. The utility shall also, per the orders of the Commission, continue
   current requirements of reporting annual reliability indices of SAIFI, SAIDI
   and CAIDI (with and without Major Service Outages and Major Event Days) in the
   annual Consolidated Report of the following year.

   3603.17. No earlier than June 30, 2015, the utility may request the Commission
