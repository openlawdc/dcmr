ADDITIONAL FILING REQUIREMENTS FOR UTILITIES USING PROPOSED TEST YEARS INCLUDING
FORECASTED DATA (ยง 15-213)

213.1. All utilities which rely upon a proposed test year which includes
   forecasted data may update such data for changes which would have a
   significant impact on the filing. Except in extraordinary and well-explained
   circumstances as determined by the Commission, a utility will be limited to
   one update, and such update shall be filed, if at all, not later than
   twenty-one (21) days prior to the commencement of the hearings.

   213.2. Within one hundred eighty (180) days of the completion of the rate
   proceeding, a utility shall file an actual historical cost-of-service study
   for the entire proposed test year.
