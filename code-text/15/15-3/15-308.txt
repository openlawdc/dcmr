                                  DC REGULATIONS

USE OF CUSTOMER&#8217;S INFORMATION (§ 15-308)

308.1. An Applicant or a Customer need not disclose his or her Social Security
   number to the Utility, Energy Supplier, or Telecommunications Service Provider
   to obtain or maintain service.  Upon requesting a Customer’s social security
   account number, the utility shall inform the Customer that the provision of
   the number is voluntary and will not affect the provision of service to that
   Customer.

   308.2. A Utility, Energy Supplier or Telecommunications Service Provider shall
   not disclose information that reveals the status of the Account of any
   individual Customer without the Customer’s consent or upon dictate of lawful
   authority. A Utility, Energy Supplier or Telecommunications Service Provider
   may rely upon written or oral representation of the Commission or the Office
   of the People’s Counsel that consent has been granted.

   308.3. Unless a Customer consents in writing, Utility, Energy Supplier or
   Telecommunications Service Provider may not disclose or use information that
   is (1) about the Customer, and (2) was supplied to the Electric or Natural Gas
   Utility or Energy Supplier by the Customer for any purpose other than the
   purpose for which the information was originally acquired.

   308.4. The restrictions in §§308.2 and 308.3 above do not apply to lawful
   disclosures for Bill collection, credit rating reports, or to assist Customers
   who have had their service involuntarily disconnected.  It shall be the
   responsibility of the Utility, Energy Supplier or Telecommunications Service
   Provider to obtain and maintain the written consent referred to in §§308.2
   and 308.3 above. This information shall be made available to the Commission
   upon request.
