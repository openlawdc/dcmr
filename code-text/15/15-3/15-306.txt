                                  DC REGULATIONS

DEFERRED PAYMENT AGREEMENTS (§ 15-306)

306.1. The Utility, Energy Supplier or Telecommunications Service Provider and
   the Customer may enter into a Deferred Payment Agreement (DPA). The Utility
   shall include the Utility, Energy Supplier or Telecommunications Service
   Provider past due balances as part of its DPA. No Charges, other than those
   accrued as of the date of settlement, and no interest shall be charged as part
   of the Deferred Payment Agreement.

   306.2. Every DPA negotiated and agreed to between the Customer and the
   Utility, Energy Supplier, or Telecommunications Service Provider shall be
   provided to the Customer in writing within ten (10) Business Days and shall
   include the following information:
   
   
   
   (a)	The date of the DPA;
   
   
   
   (b)	The amount overdue and the payment terms of the DPA, including down
   payment amount and installment terms;
   
   
   
   (c)	The process that the Utility, Energy or Telecommunications Service
   Provider will follow, including a notice of Disconnection, to enforce the
   terms of the DPA;
   
   
   
   (d)	A Customer’s failure to make a scheduled payment under the DPA when due
   is a default and places the Account in delinquent status as of the date of
   default.  Late payment Charges shall apply to any default of a DPA and may
   cause the DPA to become void; and
   
   
   
   (e)	The DPA shall state that all subsequent Bills must be paid on or before
   the due date.  Failure to pay all such subsequent Bills as stated will cause
   the DPA to become void.  In such cases, normal collection activities, up to
   and including Disconnection may resume.
