RECONSIDERATION (ยง 17-3140)

3140.1. A respondent or the Corporation Counsel may file a petition for
   reconsideration with the Director within ten (10) days after the date of
   service of the decision on that party.  The petitioner shall serve a copy of
   the petition on each party.

   3140.2. Neither the filing nor the granting of a petition for reconsideration
   shall operate as a stay of a decision unless specifically ordered by the
   Director.  The Director may grant a stay only upon good cause involving
   consideration of the likelihood of decisional error, irreparable harm to the
   petitioning party, harm to any other party, or the public interest.

   3140.3. A petition for reconsideration shall state briefly and specifically
   the following:
   
   (a) 	The matter of record or point of law alleged to have been erroneously
   decided or overlooked;
   
   (b) 	The grounds relied upon; and
   
   (c) 	The relief sought.

   3140.4. If a petition is based in whole or in part on new matter, the matter
   shall be set forth in an affidavit, containing the statement that the
   petitioner could not, with due diligence, have known or have discovered the
   new matter prior to the hearing before the Director.

   3140.5. The Director may permit or require oral argument upon a petition.

   3140.6. The Director shall rule on a petition within forty-five (45) days
   after the filing of the petition.  Failure by the Director to act within that
   period shall constitute a denial of the petition.
