REPRESENTATION (§ 17-3129)

3129.1. A respondent may be represented only by an attorney who is an active
   member of the District of Columbia Bar, except that the Director may permit an
   attorney who is an active member of the bar of another jurisdiction in the
   United States to represent a respondent in a particular case.
   
   3129.2 	If it appears to the Director that the issues or facts in a matter
   before him are so complex that the interests of justice, saving time, or
   facilitating the development of an adequate record would be served by the
   representation of a party by an attorney, the Director may request, but not
   require, that the party obtain an attorney and may allow a reasonable period
   of time to do so.

   3129.3. An attorney shall not represent any person in a hearing until the
   attorney submits a signed statement containing the attorney’s name, street
   address, telephone number, and bar number.
