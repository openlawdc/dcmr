TERMINATION OF LICENSES (§ 17-212)

212.1. A business license issued under this chapter shall terminate if the
   licensee fails to file and maintain an approved bond as required under this
   chapter.

   212.2. If the master electrician or master electrician specialist resigns or
   severs his or her connection with the person, firm, or corporation licensed
   under this chapter, or if the occupational license of the master electrician
   or master electrician specialist who is named on that business license
   expires, it shall become the obligation of the licensed firm or corporation
   immediately to secure the services of a qualified, licensed replacement.

   212.3. If the firm or corporation is not licensed (under the provisions of

   provide the replacement and to promptly notify the Director of the replacement
   shall render the business license void.

   212.4. If any person listed in §212.2 severs his or her connection with any
   business licensed under this chapter, it shall be the duty of both that person
   and the licensee to notify the Director promptly.
