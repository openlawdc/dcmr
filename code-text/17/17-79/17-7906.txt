                                  DC REGULATIONS

CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS (§ 17-7906)

7906.1. This section shall apply to renewal, reactivation, or reinstatement of
   a license.

   7906.2. This section shall not apply to applicants for an initial license by
   examination, reciprocity, or endorsement, nor shall it apply to applicants for
   the first renewal of a license granted by examination.

   7906.3. An applicant for renewal of a license, who is not subject to
   Subsection 7906.4, shall submit proof of having completed twenty (20) hours of
   approved continuing education hours during the two (2) year period preceding
   the date the license expires, including one (1) hour of ethics.  The hours
   must be related to speech-language pathology.

   7906.4. An applicant for dual licensure renewal shall submit proof of having
   completed thirty (30) hours of approved continuing education hours during the
   two year period preceding the date the license expires, including one (1) hour
   in ethics.  Of the thirty (30) hours, the applicant shall have completed at
   least five (5) hours in both the audiology and speech-language pathology
   disciplines.  The intent of this paragraph is likewise shared by, and may be
   cross-referenced with, Subsection 7808.4 of Chapter 78 of Title 17 of the
   District of Columbia Municipal Regulations, which govern the continuing
   education requirements of audiologists.

   7906.5. An applicant for reinstatement of a license shall submit proof of
   having completed ten (10) hours of continuing education for each year during
   which the license was not valid, provided that:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   If an applicant seeks to be licensed more than five (5) years after the date
   that the applicant’s license expires, the applicant shall meet the
   requirements for obtaining an initial license; and
   
   
   
   (b) 	In order to reinstate a license, an applicant for reinstatement must have
   met all continuing education requirements for the licensure period immediately
   prior to the expiration of the license in addition to ten (10) hours for each
   year the applicant was unlicensed.
   
   
   
   7906.6 	An applicant for reactivation of a license shall submit proof of
   having completed twenty (20) hours of continuing education per renewal period.
   
   
   
   7906.7 	A license is not valid until it is renewed or reinstated.
   
   
   
   7906.8 		A holder of an expired or sanctioned license shall only be eligible
   to apply for renewal or reinstatement of the sanctioned or expired license by
   meeting any legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the expired
   license in addition to the requirements set forth in any applicable order of
   the Board.
   
   
   
   7906.9 	The Board shall periodically conduct a random audit of at least ten
   percent (10%) of its active licensees to determine continuing education
   compliance. Any licensee selected for the audit shall return the completed
   continuing education compliance audit form and all supporting documentation to
   the Board within thirty (30) days of receiving notification of the audit.
   Failure to comply with the continuing education requirements may subject the
   licensee to disciplinary action by the Board.
