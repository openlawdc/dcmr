7910.1. The Board may issue a license by endorsement to a speech-language
   pathologist who has a valid, unrestricted license in good standing from
   another jurisdiction of the United States with standards which are, as
   determined by the Board, substantially equivalent to the District of Columbia
   laws and regulations.

   Submit a completed application to the Board on the required forms and include:
   
   
   
   (i) The applicant’s social security number, or, if the applicant does not
   have a social security number, a sworn affidavit, under penalty of perjury,
   that the applicant does not have a social security number; and
   
   
   
   (ii)  Two (2) recent passport-type photos.

   verification form must be sent directly to the Board by the verifying
   jurisdiction;
