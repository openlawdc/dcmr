   (including hearings before an administrative agency) is offered in evidence, a
   certified true copy of that part shall be presented to the board in the form
   of an exhibit, unless either of the following requirements is satisfied:
   
   
   
   (a)	The record is specified in such manner as to be readily identified, and
   the person offering the record agrees to supply copies later or when required
   by the board; or
   
   
   
   (b)	There is a stipulation that the record may be incorporated by reference
   and the board directs that incorporation.

   (b)	Material facts in the official files of a board or the Department or other
   District agency; or
   
   
   
   (c)	A fact which is not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is generally
   known within the District of Columbia or is capable of accurate and ready
   determination by resort to sources the accuracy of which cannot reasonably be
   questioned.

   4110.5. If a board takes official notice of a material fact not appearing in

   were present. A board, in its discretion, may require additional evidence
   regarding any matter covered by a stipulation.
