                                  DC REGULATIONS

PETITIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION (ยง 17-4120)

4120.1. A respondent or the Corporation Counsel may file a petition for
   reconsideration, rehearing, or reargument within ten (10) days after the date
   of the service of the decision on that party. The party filing a petition
   shall serve a copy of the petition on each party separately represented.

   4120.2. Neither the filing nor the granting of a petition shall operate as a
   stay of a decision unless specifically ordered by a board. A stay shall be
   granted only upon good cause, which shall involve a consideration of the
   likelihood of board error, irreparable harm to the petitioning party, the harm
   to other parties, and the public interest.

   4120.3. A petition shall state briefly and specifically the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The matters of record or points of law alleged to have been erroneously
   decided or overlooked;
   
   
   
   (b)	The grounds relied upon; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The relief sought.

   4120.4. If a petition is based in whole or in part on new matter, the matter
   shall be set forth in an affidavit, containing a statement that the petitioner
   could not with due diligence have known or have discovered the new matter
   prior to the hearing before the board.

   4120.5. A board, in its discretion, may permit or require oral argument upon a
   petition before the board.

   4120.6. A board shall grant or deny a petition within forty-five (45) days
   after the filing of the petition, but the failure by the board to act within
   that period shall be deemed a denial of the petition.

   4120.7. A decision shall be in writing, and shall be signed by the
   chairperson. The chairperson shall serve copies of the decision on all parties
   or their counsels of record.
