REPRESENTATION (ยง 17-4106)

4106.1. A respondent appearing before a board at a hearing, or appealing a
   decision of an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) before a board pursuant to
   ยง4123, shall have the right to be represented by an attorney who is an active
   member of the District of Columbia Bar. The chairperson of the board shall
   give notice of that appearance to the Director and the Corporation Counsel.

   4106.2. If it appears to a board that the issues or facts in a matter before
   it are so complex that the interests of justice, saving time or facilitating
   the preparation of an adequate record would be served by the representation of
   a party by an attorney, the board may urge, but not require, that the party
   obtain the services of an attorney and may allow that party a reasonable
   period of time within which to do so.

   4106.3. No person may participate in a representative capacity in any hearing
   conducted by a board until the person delivers to the board a signed statement
   containing the person&#8217;s name, street address, telephone number, and
   District of Columbia Bar number. The written statement of counsel shall be
   made a part of the record.

   4106.4. Any person authorized to appear pursuant to this section may sign any
   paper required or permitted either by this subtitle or the Act to be filed
   with a board.
