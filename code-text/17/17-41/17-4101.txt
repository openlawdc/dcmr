                                  DC REGULATIONS

COMPLAINTS (§ 17-4101)

4101.1. A board, on its own motion or on the receipt of a complaint submitted
   in accordance with §4101.2, shall request the Director to investigate a
   health professional if the facts alleged in the complaint, if proven, would
   constitute sufficient grounds for disciplinary action under §514(a) of the
   Act, D.C. Code §2-3305.14(a) (1987 Supp.), other provisions of the Act, or
   this subtitle.

   4101.2. A person who desires to file a complaint against a health professional
   shall do the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Submit the complaint in writing;
   
   
   
   (b)	State the facts or circumstances that form the basis of the complaint;
   
   
   
   (c)	Sign the complaint and state the complainant&#8217;s name and address; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Mail or deliver the complaint to the board.

   4101.3. Nothing in §4101.2 shall preclude a board, on its own motion, from
   requesting the Director to investigate a health professional based on
   information obtained from an individual who does not file a complaint in
   accordance with that subsection.

   4101.4. Upon receiving a complaint, a board may, in its discretion, order that
   the health professional complained of answer the complaint within ten (10)
   days of receipt of the complaint. The board shall attach a copy of the
   complaint to an order to answer or shall describe the acts alleged in the
   complaint. The health professional shall respond to an order to answer either
   personally or through his or her attorney. An answer shall address the
   substantive allegations set forth in the complaint or order.

   4101.5. If a board receives a written response from a health professional
   requested pursuant to §4101.4, it may, in its discretion, send a copy of the
   response to the complainant and request a written reply within a time period
   determined by the board.

   4101.6. Upon receipt of a health professional&#8217;s answer or at any point
   during the course of the investigation or inquiry into the complaint, the
   board may determine that there is not and will not be sufficient evidence to
   warrant further proceedings or that the complaint fails to allege incompetence
   or misconduct for which a health professional may be sanctioned by the board.
   In such event, the board shall dismiss the complaint.

   4101.7. For purposes of a hearing on the substance of the complaint in
   accordance with § 4102 should a hearing occur, a board may draw an adverse
   inference from a respondent&#8217;s failure to respond to an order to answer
   the complaint and shall weigh that inference together with all other evidence
   in determining whether or not a matter has been proved.

   4101.8. If a health professional violates the board&#8217;s order and fails to
   answer within the ten (10) day period or if the board determines that there is
   otherwise reason to believe that the acts alleged occurred and constitute a
   violation pursuant to D.C. Official Code § 3-1205.14, the board may take one
   (1) of the following actions:
   
   
   
   (a)	Refer the complaint to the Director for investigation;
   
   
   
   (b)	Set the matter for a hearing in accordance with § 4102 on the substance
   of the complaint or on the health professional&#8217;s violation of the
   board&#8217;s order to answer; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Request that the licensee or respondent attend a settlement conference in
   accordance with § 4108.

   4101.9. If a board dismisses a complaint, it shall give the complainant notice
   in writing, sent first class mail, of the dismissal of the complaint within
   ten (10) days of the action.
