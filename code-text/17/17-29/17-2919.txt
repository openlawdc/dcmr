RADIOLOGICAL EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES (ยง 17-2919)

2919.1. An animal facility shall have the capability and proof of use of
   either in-house or consultant services for obtaining diagnostic quality
   radiographs.

   2919.2. Radiograph equipment shall conform to the following requirements:
   
   
   
   (a)	The protective tube housing shall be of diagnostic type;
   
   
   
   (b)	Diaphragms or cones shall be provided for collimating the useful beam to
   the area of clinical interest and shall provide the same degree of protection
   as is required of the housing;
   
   
   
   (c)	The total filtration permanently in the useful beam shall not be less than
   one-half of one millimeter (0.5 mm) aluminum equivalent for machines operating
   up to fifty kilovolt potential (50 kVp), one and one-half millimeter (1.5mm)
   aluminum equivalent for machines operating between fifty to seventy kilovolt
   potential (50 to 70 kVp), and two and one-half millimeters (2.5 mm) aluminum
   equivalent for machines operating above seventy kilovolt potential (70 kVp);
   
   
   
   (d)	A device shall be provided to terminate the exposure after a preset time
   of exposure; and
   
   
   
   (e)	A dead-man type of exposure switch shall be provided, together with an
   electrical cord of sufficient length, so that the operator can stand out of
   the useful beam and at least six feet (6&#8242;) from the animal during all
   X-ray exposures. This paragraph does not apply to field radiograph procedures.

   2919.3. The dark room shall be maintained in a clean and orderly manner and
   shall be of adequate size for the proper development of radiographs.

   2919.4. Equipment shall be maintained in good operating condition for the
   proper development of radiographs.
