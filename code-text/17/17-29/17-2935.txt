REPRESENTATION (ยง 17-2935)

2935.1. A respondent may be represented only by an attorney who is an active
   member of the District of Columbia Bar, except that the Director may permit an
   attorney who is an active member of the bar of another jurisdiction in the
   United States to represent a respondent in a particular case.

   2935.2. If it appears to the Director that the issues or facts in a matter
   before it are so complex that the interests of justice, saving time, or
   facilitating the preparation of an adequate record would be served by the
   representation of a party by an attorney, the Director may urge, but not
   require, that the party obtain the services of an attorney and may allow that
   party a reasonable period of time within which to do so.

   2935.3. An attorney shall not participate in a representative capacity in any
   hearing conducted by the Director until the attorney submits to the Director a
   signed statement containing the attorney&#8217;s name, street address,
   telephone number, and bar number.

   2935.4. An attorney authorized to appear pursuant to this section may sign any
   paper required or permitted by this chapter or the Act to be filed with the
   Director.
