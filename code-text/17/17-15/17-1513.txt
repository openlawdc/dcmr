   (a)	The Board shall mail, or send via electronic means, a renewal notice to
   the last known physical address or email address of every person licensed by
   the Board at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the license cycle.
   
   
   
   (b)	Subject to subparagraph (c) of this section, the renewal application and
   fees must be received by the Board prior to the expiration date of the
   license.
   
   
   
   (c)	A holder of a license who fails to renew before the expiration date may
   renew the license within sixty (60) days after expiration upon paying the
   required late fee. Upon renewal, the holder shall be deemed to have possessed
   a valid license during the period between the expiration of the license and
   its renewal.

   1513.2. If a holder of a license fails to renew the license within sixty (60)
   days after its expiration, the license shall be deemed to have lapsed on the
   date of expiration and the holder shall be required to apply for reinstatement
   of the expired license and pay the required reinstatement fee.

   1513.3. The responsibility for the timely renewal of a licensee&#8217;s
   license rests solely with the individual licensee.
