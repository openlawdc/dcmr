                                  DC REGULATIONS

RECONSIDERATION (ยง 17-3334)

3334.1. A respondent may file with a board a petition for reconsideration or
   reopening a hearing within fifteen (15) days after the date of the service of
   the decision on that party. The petitioner shall serve a copy of the petition
   on each party.

   3334.2. Neither the filing nor the granting of a petition shall operate as a
   stay of a decision unless specifically ordered by a board. A board may grant a
   stay only upon good cause involving consideration of the likelihood of
   decisional error, irreparable harm to the petitioning party, the harm to other
   parties, and the public interest.

   3334.3. A petition shall state briefly and specifically the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	In the case of a motion for a reconsideration, the matters of record or
   points of law alleged to have been erroneously decided or overlooked;
   
   
   
   (b)	In the case of a motion to reopen a hearing, the reasons that respondent
   failed to appear at a hearing;
   
   
   
   (c)	The grounds relied upon; and
   
   
   
   (d)	The relief sought.

   3334.4. If a petition is based in whole or in part on new matter, the matter
   shall be set forth in an affidavit, containing a statement that the petitioner
   could not with due diligence have known or have discovered the new matter
   prior to the hearing before a board.

   3334.5. A board may, in its discretion, permit or require oral argument upon a
   petition before the board.

   3334.6. A board shall grant or deny a petition within forty-five (45) days
   after the filing of the petition. The failure by the board to act within that
   period shall constitute a denial of the petition.
