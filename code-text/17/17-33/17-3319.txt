REPRESENTATION (ยง 17-3319)

3319.1. A respondent may be represented only by an attorney who is an active
   member of the District of Columbia Bar, except that a board may permit an
   attorney who is an active member of the bar of another jurisdiction in the
   United States to represent a respondent in a particular case.

   3319.2. If it appears to a board or an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) that the
   issues or facts in a matter before it are so complex that the interests of
   justice, saving time or facilitating the preparation of an adequate record
   would be served by the representation of a party by an attorney, the board may
   urge, but not require, that the party obtain the services of an attorney and
   may allow that party a reasonable period of time within which to do so.

   3319.3. An attorney shall not participate in a representative capacity in any
   hearing conducted by a board or ALJ until the attorney submits to a board or
   ALJ a signed statement containing the attorney&#8217;s name, street address,
   telephone number, and bar number.

   3319.4. An attorney authorized to appear pursuant to this section may sign any
   paper required or permitted to be filed by this chapter.
