                                  DC REGULATIONS

SCOPE OF PRACTICE (§ 17-3410)

3410.1. For the purposes of this chapter, the term “practice of
   architecture” means rendering or offering to render services in connection
   with the design and construction, enlargement, or alteration of a structure or
   group of structures that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or
   habitation, as well as the space within and surrounding these structures.
   These services include planning and providing studies, designs, drawings,
   specifications, and other technical submissions, and the administration of
   construction contracts. The practice of architecture does not include the
   practice of engineering, as defined in D.C. Official Code § 47-2853.131,
   although an architect may perform engineering work that is incidental to the
   practice of architecture.
