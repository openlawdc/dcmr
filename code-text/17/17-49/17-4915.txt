                                  DC REGULATIONS

DELEGATION AGREEMENT (ยง 17-4915)

4915.1. Prior to the physician assistant beginning practice, he or she shall
   have a written delegation agreement using the form provided by the Board. The
   delegation agreement shall describe the physician assistant&#8217;s role in
   the practice and the settings in which the supervising physician(s)
   delegate(s) to the physician assistant the authority to see patients.

   4915.2. The delegation agreement form must be signed by the supervising
   physician(s) and physician assistant and be filed by the physician assistant
   with the Board and kept on file at the primary practice site.

   4915.3. In the event that there are changes to the delegation agreement, a new
   agreement form must be signed by the physician and physician assistant and be
   filed by the physician assistant with the Board and kept on file at the
   primary practice site.

   4915.4. If there are changes to the supervising physician(s), the physician
   assistant must file with the Board a form provided by the Board for additions
   and deletions to the list of supervising physicians within ten (10) days of
   the effective date of the change.

   4915.5. If there is a change in the employment status of the physician
   assistant, or the delegation agreement is otherwise terminated, a termination
   form provided by the Board must be filed by the first supervising physician
   listed on the delegation agreement with the Board within ten (10) days of the
   change of employment status of the physician assistant.

   4915.6. A delegation agreement expires automatically upon termination of the
   employment of a physician assistant. However, termination of employment of a
   physician assistant does not cause a physician assistant&#8217;s license to
   expire.

   4915.7. Whenever it is determined that a physician or physician assistant is
   practicing in a manner inconsistent with the delegation agreement, the Board
   may demand modification of the agreement and take disciplinary action as
   appropriate.

   4915.8. The Board shall maintain the following records regarding physician
   assistants, which records shall be available for public inspection:
   
   
   
   (a)	A registry of physician assistants;
   
   
   
   (b)	A registry of supervising physicians; and
   
   
   
   (c)	A copy of each delegation agreement.
