   physician assistant that has been imposed by Board disciplinary action; and

   agreement must state that the physician will exercise supervision over the
   physician assistant in accordance with any rule adopted by the Board and will
   retain professional and legal responsibility for the care rendered by the
   physician assistant. The agreement must be signed by the physician and the
   physician assistant and updated at the time of physician assistant licensure

   authority to perform health care tasks.
