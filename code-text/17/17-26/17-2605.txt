AND SALESPERSONS (§ 17-2605)

2605.1. This section shall apply to all applicants for the renewal or
   reinstatement of a real estate broker, real estate salesperson, or property
   manager license, except those applicants seeking first renewal of a license
   granted by examination.

   2605.2. A continuing education credit shall be valid only if it is part of a
   program or activity approved by the Commission in accordance with § 2607 of
   this chapter. Licensees are responsible for ensuring that continuing education
   courses taken to satisfy the Commission’s renewal or reinstatement
   requirements are Commission certified or approved.

   2605.3. The continuing education renewal requirements of a real estate
   broker’s, real estate salesperson’s, or property manager’s license shall
   be as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	An applicant for renewal of a real estate broker’s license, a real
   estate salesperson’s license, or a property manager’s license shall submit
   proof pursuant to § 2605.6 of this section that the applicant has completed
   no fewer than fifteen (15) hours of acceptable continuing education credit
   during the two- (2-) year period preceding the date the license expires.
   
   
   
   (b)	Of the fifteen (15) hours noted in Subsection (a), nine (9) hours shall
   consist of mandated courses with curriculums administratively established and
   approved by the Commission and six (6) hours will be general elective courses
   as approved by the Commission.

   2605.4. A licensee applying to renew a property manager’s license who also
   possesses an active real estate broker’s or real estate salesperson’s
   license shall be considered to have satisfied the continuing education
   requirements for renewal of the property manager license if the licensee has
   satisfied the renewal requirements for the real estate broker’s or real
   estate salesperson’s license.

   2605.5. Licensees who also hold equivalent licenses in another jurisdiction
   may, at the Commission’s discretion, substitute continuing education credit
   completed in the other jurisdiction for the general elective continuing
   education requirements under this section if the licensee earned the
   continuing education credit during the two- (2-) year period preceding the
   date that the licensee’s District license expires.

   2605.6. An applicant shall prove completion of required continuing education
   credits by submitting with the application a certification of completion that
   includes the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The name and address of the sponsor of the program;
   
   
   
   (b)	The name of the program, its location, a description of the subject matter
   covered, and the names of the instructors;
   
   
   
   (c)	The dates on which the applicant attended the program;
   
   
   
   (d)	The hours of credit claimed; and
   
   
   
   (e)	A verification of completion with the signature or stamp of the sponsor.

   2605.7. An applicant for renewal of an inactive license or reinstatement of an
   expired, suspended or revoked real estate broker’s, real estate
   salesperson’s, or property manager’s license shall submit proof pursuant
   to § 2605.6 of this section of having completed the following continuing
   education credits:
   
   
   
   (a)	Nine (9) hours of mandated courses with curriculums administratively
   established and approved by the Commission; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Six (6) hours of general elective courses, as approved by the Commission,
   per licensing cycle that the applicant’s license was inactive, expired,
   revoked or suspended.

   2605.8. An applicant for the renewal of a license who fails to submit proof of
   having completed the continuing education requirements by or before the
   expiration date may renew the license within sixty (60) days after expiration
   by submitting proof pursuant to § 2605.6 of this section and by paying the
   required late fee. Upon renewal, the Commission will deem the applicant to
   have possessed a valid license during the period between the expiration of the
   license and its renewal.

   2605.9. If an applicant for the renewal of a license fails to submit proof of
   having completed required continuing education prior to the expiration date of
   the license within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicant’s
   license, the license shall be deemed to have lapsed on the date of expiration,
   and the applicant shall be required to apply for reinstatement of the expired
   license pursuant to § 2622 of this chapter.

   2605.10. The Commission may grant an extension of the sixty (60) day period to
   renew after expiration if the applicant’s failure to submit proof of
   completion was for good cause. For purposes of this subsection, “good
   cause” includes proof of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Serious and protracted illness of the applicant, who must submit a
   doctor’s statement verifying the illness;
   
   
   
   (b)	The death or serious and protracted illness of a member of the
   applicant’s immediate family, if the death or illness resulted in the
   applicant’s inability to complete the continuing education requirements
   within the specified time. For the purposes of this subsection, the term
   “immediate family” means the applicant’s spouse and any parent, brother,
   sister, or child of the applicant and the spouse of any such parent, brother,
   sister, or child; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Due to age (seventy (70) years of age or older), the applicant is unable to
   complete the requirements within the specified time.
