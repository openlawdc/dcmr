499.1. When used in this chapter or in connection with the implementation of
   this chapter, the terms and phrases set forth in this section shall have the
   meanings ascribed.
   
   
   
   Boiler Horsepower &#8211; a horsepower shall be defined as any of the
   following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The evaporation of thirty-four and one-half pounds of steam per hour (34.5
   lbs./hr.) from and at two hundred twelve degrees (212°F.);
   
   
   
   (b)	Thirty-three thousand four hundred and seventy-five British Thermal Units
   per hour (33,475 BTU/hr.);
   
   
   
   (c)	One hundred forty square feet (140 ft.2) of steam radiation;
   
   
   
   (d)	Two hundred twenty-four square feet (224 ft.2) of water radiation at one
   hundred fifty degrees Fahrenheit (150° F.); or
   
   
   
   (e)	Ten kilowatts per hour (10 kw./hr.) electrical input to the boiler.
   
   
   
   Compressor Horsepower of a Refrigerating System &#8211; for purposes of this
   chapter, the manufacturer&#8217;s horsepower rating as given on the name plate
   of the unit.
   
   
   
   High Pressure Boiler &#8211; any steam boiler that has the safety valve(s) set
   to relieve a pressure of more than fifteen pounds per square inch (15
   lbs./in.2).
   
   
   
   Horsepower Rating &#8211; the horsepower rating of a boiler shall be the
   largest rating determined in accordance with the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	By dividing the square feet of boiler heating surface by ten (10);
   
   
   
   (b)	If the boiler rating is based on other than ten square feet of heating
   surface per horsepower (10 ft.2/hp.), the manufacturer&#8217;s output rating
   in horsepower shall be used; or
   
   
   
   (c)	If the manufacturer&#8217;s output rating is expressed in terms other than
   horsepower, the rating shall be converted into horsepower by the use of one of
   the factors in the definition of &#8220;boiler horsepower.&#8221;
   
   
   
   Horsepower Rating of a Refrigeration System &#8211; where reference is made to
   the &#8220;horsepower of a refrigeration system,&#8221; this shall be
   considered to be either compressor horsepower or tons of refrigeration as
   converted to horsepower on an equal basis.
   
   
   
   Hot Water Heating Boiler &#8211; any hot water boiler operated at pressures
   not exceeding one hundred sixty pounds (160 lbs.) or temperatures not
   exceeding two hundred fifty degrees Fahrenheit (250°F.).
   
   
   
   Low Pressure Boiler &#8211; any steam boiler that has the safety valve(s) set
   to relieve at a pressure of fifteen pounds per square inch (15 lbs/in.2) or
   less.
   
   
   
   Packaged Self-Contained Air Conditioning Unit &#8211; a &#8220;packaged,
   self-contained&#8221; air conditioning unit is where the unit is contained in
   one casing except for a cooling tower and circulating pump, and which is
   completely assembled and tested by one manufacturer and bears the approval
   label of the Underwriters Laboratories or the American Gas Association.
   
   
   
   Ton of Refrigeration &#8211; the removal of heat at the rate of twelve
   thousand British Thermal Units per hour (12,000 BTU/hr.).
