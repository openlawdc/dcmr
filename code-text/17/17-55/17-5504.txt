   (b)	Meet the educational requirements of this chapter; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Meet any other requirements as set forth by the Board.

   with the application a sworn affidavit, under penalty of perjury, stating that
   he or she does not have a social security number; and
   
   
   
   (2)	Two (2) recent passport-type photographs of the applicant&#8217;s face

   Board;
   
   
   
   (c)	Sit for the NCLEX-PN examination not later than ninety (90) days following
   submission of the application. The Board may, in its discretion, grant an
   extension of the time requirement if the applicant&#8217;s failure to sit for

   cause&#8221; includes the following:
   
   
   
   (1)	Serious and protracted illness of the applicant; or

   (e)	Pay all required fees.

   5504.3. An application that remains incomplete for ninety (90) days or more
   from the date of submission shall be considered abandoned, and closed by the
   Board. The applicant shall thereafter be required to reapply, comply with the
   current requirements for licensure, and pay the required fees.

   5504.4. If an applicant has not yet taken or passed the NCLEX-PN examination

   to sit for the next available NCLEX-PN examination. For purposes of this
   section:
   
   
   
   (a)	Graduates of an educational program in practical nursing approved in
   accordance with § 5502.1 are eligible to apply to sit for the exam upon
   graduation.
   
   
   
   (b)	Graduates of an educational program in practical nursing in a foreign
   country not approved in accordance with § 5502.1 are eligible to apply to sit
   for the exam upon completion of the requirements set forth in § 5503.1.

   5504.5. If an applicant has not yet taken or passed the NCLEX-RN examination
