   SELLER’S DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
   
   
   
   Instructions to the Seller for Seller’s Disclosure Statement:
   
   
   
   These Instructions are to assist the Seller in completing the required
   Seller’s Disclosure Statement in order to comply with the District of
   Columbia Residential Real Property Seller Disclosure Act.
   
   
   
   1.	Who must complete the Seller’s Disclosure Statement? The Seller, not the
   broker and not the management company, condominium association, cooperative
   association or homeowners association.
   
   
   
   2.	In what types of transactions must the Seller provide the Seller’s
   Disclosure Statement to the Purchaser? The Act applies to the following types
   of transfers or sales of District of Columbia real estate:
   
   
   
   (a)	where the property consists of one to four residential dwelling units,
   and,
   
   
   
   (b)	the transactions a sale, exchange, installment land contract, lease with
   an option to purchase, or any other option to purchase, and,
   
   
   
   (c)	the purchaser expresses, in writing, an interest to reside in the property
   to be transferred
   
   
   
   However, the Act does not apply to:
   
   
   
   (a)	court ordered transfers;
   
   
   
   (b)	transfers to a mortgagee by a mortgagor in default;
   
   
   
   (c)	transfers by sale under a power of sale in a deed of trust or mortgage or
   any foreclosure sale under a decree of foreclosure or deed in lieu of
   foreclosures;
   
   
   
   (d)	transfers by a non-occupant fiduciary administering a decedent’s estate,
   guardianship, conservatorship or trust;
   
   
   
   (e)	transfers between co-tenants;
   
   
   
   (f)	transfers made to the transferor’s spouse, parent, grandparent, child,
   grandchild or sibling(or any combination of the foregoing);
   
   
   
   (g)	transfer between spouses under a divorce judgment incidental to such a

   (h)	transfers or exchanges to or from any governmental entity; and
   
   
   
   (i)	transfers made by a person of newly constructed residential property that
   has not been inhabited.
   
   
   
   3.	When does the Seller’s Disclosure Statement have to be provided to the
   Purchaser? In a sale, before or at the time the prospective transferee
   executes a purchase agreement with the transferor. In an installment sales
   contract (where a binding purchase contract has not been executed), or in the
   case of a lease with no option to purchase, before or at the time the
   prospective transferee executes the installment sales contract or lease with
   the transferor.
   
   
   
   4.	What information must the Seller disclose? Answer ALL questions on the
   Seller’s Disclosure Statement. If some items do not apply to your property,
   check “N/A” (not applicable). If you do not know the facts, check
   “UNKNOWN”. Report actually known conditions referred to in the questions.
   Each disclosure must be made in “good faith” (honesty in fact in the
   making of the disclosure). Attach additional pages with your signature if
   additional space is required.
   
   
   
   The Seller of a condominium unit, cooperative unit, or a lot in a homeowners
   association, is to provide information only as to the Seller’s unit or lot,
   and not as to any common elements, common areas or other areas outside of the
   unit or lot.
   
   
   
   5.	What is the remedy if the Seller does not provide the Seller’s Disclosure
   Statement to the Transferee? If the Seller’s Disclosure Statement is
   delivered after the purchaser executes the purchase agreement, installment
   sales contract or lease with an option to purchase, the purchaser may
   terminate the transaction by written notice to the seller not more than five
   (5) calendar days after receipt of the Seller’s Disclosure Statement by the
   purchaser, and the deposit must be returned to the purchaser. The right to
   terminate is waived if not exercised before the earliest of:

   in writing that the right to rescind terminates on submission of the
   application);
   
   
   
   (b)	settlement or date of occupancy in the case of a sale; or
   
   
   
   (c)	occupancy in the case of a lease with an option to purchase.
   
   
   
   6.	If the Seller finds out different information after providing the
   Seller’s Disclosure Statement to the Purchaser, how does this impact a
   ratified contract? If information becomes inaccurate after delivery of the
   disclosure form, the inaccuracy shall not be grounds for terminating the
   transaction.
   
   
   
   7.	How must a Seller deliver the Seller’s Disclosure Statement to the
   Transferee? The Seller’s Disclosure Statement must be delivered by personal
   delivery, facsimile delivery, or by registered mail to the transferee.

   original.
