                                  DC REGULATIONS

RECONSIDERATION (ยง 17-1731)

1731.1. A respondent may file with a Hearing Examiner a petition for
   reconsideration or reopening a hearing within fifteen (15) days after the date
   of the service of the decision on that party. The petitioner shall serve a
   copy of the petition on each party.

   1731.2. Neither the filing nor the granting of a petition shall operate as a
   stay of a decision unless specifically ordered by the Hearing Examiner. A
   Hearing Examiner may grant a stay only upon good cause involving consideration
   of the likelihood of decisional error, irreparable harm to the petitioning
   party, the harm to other parties, and the public interest.

   1731.3. A petition shall state briefly and specifically the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	In the case of a motion for a reconsideration, the matters of record or
   points of law alleged to have been erroneously decided or overlooked;
   
   
   
   (b)	In the case of a motion to reopen a hearing, the reasons that respondent
   failed to appear at a hearing;
   
   
   
   (c)	The grounds relied upon; and
   
   
   
   (d)	The relief sought.

   1731.4. If a petition is based in whole or in part on new matter, the matter
   shall be set forth in an affidavit, containing a statement that the petitioner
   could not with due diligence have known or have discovered the new matter
   prior to the hearing before the Director.

   1731.5. A Hearing Examiner may, in its discretion, permit or require oral
   argument upon a petition before the Hearing Examiner.

   1731.6. A Hearing Examiner shall grant or deny a petition within forty-five
   (45) days after the filing of the petition. The failure by the Hearing
   Examiner to act within that period shall constitute a denial of the petition.
