   of the District of Columbia Bar.

   an attorney who is an active member of the Bar of another jurisdiction of the
   United States to represent a respondent.

   1721.3. If it appears to the Director or a Hearing Examiner that the issues or
   facts in a matter before it are so complex that the interests of justice,
   saving time, or facilitating the preparation of an adequate record would be

   Hearing Examiner may urge, but not require, that the party obtain the services
   of an attorney and may allow that party a reasonable period of time within
   which to do so.

   1721.4. An attorney shall not participate in a representative capacity in any

   street address, telephone number, and bar number.

   1721.5. An attorney authorized to appear pursuant to this section may sign any
