   3500.3. The types of examinations utilized for professional licensing are as
   follows: national examinations, standard examinations, and local examinations.
   National examinations are examinations developed and administered by third
   parties. Standard examinations are examinations developed by third parties and
   administered by DCRA. Local examinations are examinations developed and
   administered by DCRA or the Board or Commission regulating the individual
   occupation. Because the examination fees for national examinations and
   standard examinations change regularly, the DCRA examination/re-examination
   fees are as follows:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   National examinations: 	Actual cost;
   
   
   
   
   
   Standard examinations: 	Actual cost + $25.00 DCRA administrative fee; and
   
   
   
   
   
   Local examinations: 	$25.00 DCRA administrative fee.

   3500.4. If a Board or Commission does not require applicants to take an
   examination after submitting an application for licensure, or the applicable
   rules require applicants to pass a national examination before submitting an
   application for licensure, an applicant does not need to include an
   examination fee with his or her license application.

   3500.5. Unless otherwise specified, fees apply to all license types within a
   category.
