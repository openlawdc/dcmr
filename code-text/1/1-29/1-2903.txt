                                  DC REGULATIONS

DCPS STUDENT DISCIPLINE CASES &#8211; DECISIONS (§ 1-2903)

2903.1. After the close of the record in a student discipline case, the
   Administrative Law Judge shall issue Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
   on the issues identified in Subsection 2901.1.

   2903.2. The Administrative Law Judge shall issue the findings of fact and
   conclusions of law within one (1) school day after the close of the record. 
   OAH shall provide a copy to DCPS, which shall include it with the final
   decision sent to the adult student, the minor student’s parent or guardian
   and any authorized representative.

   2903.3. In all student discipline cases, DCPS shall be bound by the
   Administrative Law Judge’s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and shall
   have no authority to reverse or modify the findings of fact and conclusions of
   law.

   2903.4. If the Administrative Law Judge concludes that the student committed
   any of the violations upon which the disciplinary action is based, the
   Administrative Law Judge shall  make a recommendation for the appropriate
   discipline within the Tier found to be proper considering the factors in 14
   DCMR B2500.9.  OAH will return the case to DCPS for it to decide the
   appropriate discipline.

   2903.5. If the Administrative Law Judge concludes that due process was denied
   or that the student did not commit any of the violations upon which the
   disciplinary action is based, OAH will return the case to DCPS for appropriate
   action.

   2903.6. Because OAH must return these cases to DCPS for further action, the
   Administrative Law Judge’s decision is not a final disposition of the
   matter, and a statement of appeal rights is not required by Subsection 2830.1.
