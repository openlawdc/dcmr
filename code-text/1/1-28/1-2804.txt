                                  DC REGULATIONS

ANSWERS IN CIVIL FINE CASES (§ 1-2804)

2804.1  	To answer a Notice of Infraction or a Notice of Violation (both
   “Notice”), a Respondent should file the Respondent’s copy of the Notice
   at OAH.  The Respondent shall indicate on the Notice whether the
   Respondent’s answer is Admit, Admit with Explanation, or Deny.
   
   
   
   2804.2  	If a Respondent does not file the Respondent’s copy of the Notice,
   a written answer will be sufficient if it contains both the number of the
   Notice and a statement whether the Respondent’s answer is Admit, Deny, or
   Admit with Explanation.
   
   
   
   2804.3  	A Respondent is not required to send a copy of the answer to the
   Government.  OAH will send the Government a copy of every answer of Deny or
   Admit with Explanation.
   
   
   
   2804.4  	A Respondent whose answer is Admit shall pay the fine specified on
   the Notice when filing the answer.
   
   
   
   2804.5  	If a Respondent’s answer is Deny, OAH ordinarily will schedule a
   hearing and will notify the Respondent and Government, in writing, of the
   hearing date and time.  The hearing order will contain additional information
   about procedures for the hearing.

   2804.6. If a Respondent’s answer is Deny, after notice and opportunity to
   respond, an Administrative Law Judge may decide a case based on the papers
   submitted, without an in-person hearing, if a hearing is unnecessary.

   2804.7. At least five (5) calendar days before any hearing date, the
   Respondent shall file at OAH copies of all exhibits that the Respondent
   intends to ask the Administrative Law Judge to consider at the hearing.  At
   the same time, the Respondent shall send copies of those exhibits to the
   Government.  An Administrative Law Judge may allow a Respondent to use
   exhibits at a hearing that the Respondent did not file or provide to the
   Government before the hearing if there is no prejudice to the Government.
   
   
   
   2804.8  	If a Respondent’s answer is Admit with Explanation, a Respondent
   shall submit a written explanation stating why the Respondent believes the
   Administrative Law Judge should reduce or suspend the fine or any penalty. 
   The Respondent also shall submit any papers, photographs, or other materials
   supporting the Respondent’s explanation.
   
   
   
   2804.9  	OAH will send a copy of an answer of Admit with Explanation and
   supporting materials to the Government, and will allow the Government
   twenty-one (21) calendar days to reply.  The Government must send the
   Respondent a copy of everything the Government files in reply.
   
   
   
   2804.10  	The Administrative Law Judge shall decide Admit with Explanation
   cases by considering all the materials filed by the parties, including the
   exhibits filed with the Notice, Respondent’s explanation and supporting
   materials, and the Government’s reply and supporting materials.  The
   Administrative Law Judge will not hold a hearing, unless the parties’
   materials are not sufficient to allow him or her to decide the case.

   2804.11. In an Admit with Explanation case, the Administrative Law Judge shall
   dismiss the Notice if he or she determines that the Respondent did not commit
   or is not responsible for the violation charged.

   2804.12. In all civil fine cases, an Administrative Law Judge shall not impose
   a fine that exceeds the fine amount the Government requests.
