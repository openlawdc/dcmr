A PANEL OF THREE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES (§ 1-2836)

2836.1. When the holdings of Administrative Law Judges on an issue of law are
   in conflict, the Chief Administrative Law Judge may independently or on motion

   necessary to the fair enforcement of the law.  The panel’s order shall be
   binding precedent in any pending case and all later matters coming before OAH,
   unless reversed or modified.

   2836.3. Any party’s motion under this Section is automatically denied if not
   granted within fifteen (15) calendar days of its filing.
