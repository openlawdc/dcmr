CALCULATING DEADLINES (§ 1-2812)

2812.1. This Section applies to all time periods established by these Rules,
   by an order, or by any applicable law.

   2812.2. In computing any time period measured in days, the day of the act,
   event, or default from which the period begins to run shall not be included.

   2812.3. For any time period measured in days, the last day of the period shall
   be included unless OAH is closed on that day.  In that case, the period runs
   until the end of the next day on which OAH is open.

   2812.4. In computing any time period measured in hours, no hours shall be
   excluded from the computation, except as provided in this Subsection:
   
   
   
   (a)	If any period expires before 10:00 a.m. on any day OAH is open, the period
   shall be extended to 10:00 a.m. on that day.
   
   
   
   (b)	If any period expires after 4:00 p.m. on any day, the period shall be
   extended to 10:00 a.m. on the next day OAH is open.
   
   
   
   (c)	If any period expires on a day OAH is closed, the period shall be extended
   to 10:00 a.m. on the next day OAH is open.

   2812.5. When a party may or must act within a specified time period after
   service, and service is made by United States mail, commercial carrier, or
   District of Columbia Government inter-agency mail, five (5) calendar days are
   added after the period would otherwise expire, unless a statute or regulation
   provides otherwise.

   2812.6. When a party may or must act within a specified time period, an
   Administrative Law Judge for good cause shown may reduce the time or extend
   it, even after the period has expired, except for any period prescribed by
   law, or any period provided under Sections 2806 and 2828.

   2812.7. Any reference to “days” in an OAH order means calendar days unless
   specifically designated as business days in the order.
