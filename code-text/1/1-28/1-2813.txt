                                  DC REGULATIONS

MOTIONS PROCEDURE (§ 1-2813)

2813.1. A “motion” is a request for an Administrative Law Judge to take
   some action.
   
   
   
   2813.2 	Unless made during a hearing, all motions shall be in writing. 
   Without permission from an Administrative Law Judge, no motion or brief shall
   exceed twenty (20) double-spaced typed pages in length, excluding exhibits. 
   The font size shall be a minimum of twelve (12) points, with no less than
   one-inch (1”) margins.  The first page of every motion should contain: the
   parties’ names, the case number, and the name of the presiding
   Administrative Law Judge, if known.  Every motion shall state the legal and
   factual reasons for the motion and shall say what the party wants the
   Administrative Law Judge to do.
   
   
   
   2813.3 	When a motion is based on information not on the record, a party may
   support or oppose the motion with affidavits, declarations, or other papers. 
   An Administrative Law Judge may order a party to file supporting affidavits,
   declarations, or other papers.
   
   
   
   2813.4 	Except as otherwise ordered by an Administrative Law Judge, a separate
   memorandum of points and authorities need not be filed with a motion.

   2813.5. Before filing any motion (except a motion for summary adjudication, to
   dismiss, for reconsideration, relief from final order, or for sanctions), a
   party must make a good faith effort to ask all other parties if they agree to
   the motion.
   
   
   
   (a)	A “good faith effort” means a reasonable attempt, considering all the
   circumstances, to contact a party or representative in person, by telephone,
   by fax, by email, or by other means.
   
   
   
   (b)	Contact by mail is a good faith effort only if no other means is
   reasonably available (for example, not having another party’s telephone
   number or email address).
   
   
   
   (c)	By itself, serving a party with the motion is not a good faith effort.
   
   
   
   (d)	When this Subsection requires a good faith effort, the motion must
   describe that effort and say whether all other parties agreed 	to the motion.
   
   
   
   (e)	If a party fails to comply with this Subsection, an Administrative Law
   Judge may deny the motion without prejudice.

   2813.6. Unless otherwise provided by these rules or ordered by an
   Administrative Law Judge, all parties opposing a motion shall have eleven (11)
   calendar days from the service of the motion to file and serve a response.  No
   further filings related to the motion are permitted unless ordered by an
   Administrative Law Judge.

   2813.7. The Administrative Law Judge may decide any motion without holding a
   hearing.
