REQUIREMENTS FOR PROPER INVOICES (§ 1-1704)

1704.1. In order to constitute a proper invoice for payment, an invoice shall
   contain the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Name and remittance address of the business concern, and invoice number
   and date;
   
   
   
   (b)	Contract number or purchase order or other authorization for delivery of
   goods or services;
   
   
   
   (c)	Description, price and quantity of goods and services actually delivered
   or rendered;
   
   
   
   (d)	Shipping and payment terms;
   
   
   
   (e)	 Vendor’s DUNS number; and
   
   
   
   (f)	Other substantiating documentation or information as required by contract.

   1704.2. An agency may require a business concern to provide additional
   information which is helpful to the designated payment officer, but which is
   not essential. Failure of the business concern to provide this nonessential
   information with the invoice shall not render the invoice defective.

   1704.3. Invoices shall be considered received by the designated payment
   officer on the date a proper invoice is actually received in the designated
   office, or the date the agency accepts the property or service, whichever is
   later.
