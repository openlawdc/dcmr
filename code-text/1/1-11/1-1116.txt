1116.1. In recommending disciplinary action, the Board shall consult with
   legal and personnel professionals, as needed.

   1116.2. The Board may recommend that no action be taken where it finds a
   justification for the violation. Justification may include overspending as a
   result of court orders, entitlements, or explicit authorization in an
   appropriations act.

   1116.3. The decision of the Board to adopt a report of its findings and
   recommendations is determined by an affirmative vote of at least three (3)
   Members present.

   1116.4. The Board has adopted a table of penalties for violations, intended to
   be used as a non-binding guide that categorizes violations under the three (3)
   broad headings of Reporting, Budget Adherence, and Accounting and
   Disbursement. Within each category, the Board has prescribed penalties for
   first, second and third violations, including: a letter of warning, official
   reprimand, ten (10)-day suspension, demotion, and termination of employment
   (removal). [See "Table of Appropriate Penalties", attached.]
