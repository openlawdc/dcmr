                                  DC REGULATIONS

PURPOSE (§ 1-1101)

1101.1. The purpose of these Guidelines is to implement the authority
   delegated to the Board by establishing an effective, efficient, and fair
   system of independent review and resolution of reported violations of the Act.

   1101.2. The purpose of the Board is to advise and make recommendations to the
   Mayor, the Chief Financial Officer (&#8220;CFO&#8221;), the Inspector General
   (&#8220;IG&#8221;), and the Council of the District of Columbia
   (&#8220;Council&#8221;) with respect to reported anti-deficiency violations by
   officers and employees of the government of the District of Columbia
   (&#8220;District&#8221;). Because maintaining the fiscal integrity of the
   District government is of paramount importance, it is critical that reports of
   violations of the Act be evaluated by a credible, independent investigative
   board, which will assess culpability and recommend appropriate action.

   1101.3. The Act does not grant the Board the authority to review, investigate,
   determine violations of or recommend action regarding violations of the
   District&#8217;s procurement laws. In addition, although several of the
   prohibited actions contained in the federal Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C.
   §§ 1341, 1342, 1349-1351, 1511-1519 (2006), are repeated in the Act, the Act
   does not grant the Board the authority to review, investigate, determine
   violations of or recommend action regarding violations of the federal
   Anti-Deficiency Act.
