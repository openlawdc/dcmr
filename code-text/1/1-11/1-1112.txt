RESPONSIBILITIES OF EMPLOYEES OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TO THE BOARD (ยง
1-1112)

1112.1. Inquiries by the Board are official inquiries by the District
   Government. All officers, employees, and members of boards, commissions, and
   councils of the District government are required to respond to questions
   truthfully, whether orally or in writing, and must provide documents and other
   matters of official interest when requested by a representative of the Board.
   No employee shall prevent or prohibit the Board from initiating, carrying out,
   or completing any investigation within the jurisdiction of the Board.

   1112.2. Because all materials provided during employment by the District
   government are the property of the District government, an employee must
   provide all documents produced while on the job to the Board or its
   investigators as requested.
