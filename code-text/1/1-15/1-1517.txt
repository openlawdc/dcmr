   and shall follow all guidelines and procedures specified by the Archivist.

   1517.3. The Archivist may disapprove a transfer of records for the following
   reasons:

   by the public;

   practically for research purposes;
   
   
   
   (e)	The percentage of nonrecord and nonpermanent material intermingled with
   permanent records is so high that the costs of screening the records outweighs
   the benefits;
   
   
   
   (f)	The records are incorrectly described in the request for transfer; or
   
   
   
   (g)	For other sufficient reasons as determined by the Archivist.
