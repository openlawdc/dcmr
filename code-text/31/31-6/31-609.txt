                                  DC REGULATIONS

   Columbia, whether owned, rented, or leased.

   609.2. The Commission establishes a gradual removal schedule for the purposes

   (a)	Effective January 1, 2013, the following five (5) year schedule of vehicle
   removal from service will apply to all public vehicles for hire currently in
