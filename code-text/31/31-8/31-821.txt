TAXICAB STANDS (ยง 31-821)

821.1. No taxicab shall be placed upon or occupy any taxicab stand except for
   the purpose of being held forth for hire. Taxicabs shall be placed on stands
   only from the rear and shall be moved forward and to the front of the stand
   immediately as space becomes available by the departure or movement of
   preceding taxicabs. It shall be within the passenger&#8217;s discretion to
   determine which taxicab to engage on a taxi stand.

   821.2. When a taxicab stand is occupied to its full capacity, no taxicab shall
   loiter or wait nearby for the purpose of occupying space on the stand. The
   operator of every taxicab occupying a stand shall stay within five feet (5
   ft.) of his or her taxicab at all times.

   821.3. In the event any taxicab on a taxicab stand attempts to leave, other
   taxicabs on the stand shall, if necessary, move so as to permit the taxicab to
   leave.

   821.4. No taxicab stand shall be occupied by a taxicab in violation of
   regulations prohibiting parking, stopping, or standing on the street on which
   it is located during the hours 7:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m., and 4:00 p.m. to 6:30
   p.m. or during the existence of any snow or other emergency declared.

   821.5. No public vehicle for hire shall loiter in front of a hotel, theater,
   public building or place of public gathering, or in the vicinity of a taxicab
   stand which is occupied to full capacity.  Specifically, there shall be no
   stopping, except to either take on or discharge a passenger, or unnecessarily
   slow driving.  A public vehicle for hire operator shall be subject to a fine
   as provided in the table of ยง 825.2 for a violation of this subsection.

   821.6. No keeper or proprietor of a licensed hotel in the District of

   up passengers on the hotel premises. Pursuant to D.C. Official Code ยง 50-371

   hundred dollars ($300), or imprisonment for not more than ninety (90) days, or
