ON-CALL AND OFF-DUTY SIGNS (ยง 31-820)

820.1. Whenever a taxicab is proceeding to take on a passenger in answer to a
   telephone call or previous appointment, or is engaged by the hour for the
   carriage of passengers or making an emergency delivery of a parcel or package,
   the operator shall display a sign reading &#8220;On Call.&#8221;

   820.2. The &#8220;On Call&#8221; sign shall not be displayed unless the
   operator is engaged in the manner outlined in ยง 820.1. Whenever the &#8220;On
   Call&#8221; sign is displayed, the operator shall immediately enter on the
   manifest the time at which he and she went on call and the destination.

   820.3. Whenever a taxicab operator ceases to be for hire and is proceeding to
   a place without intending to take on passengers, the operator shall display a
   sign reading &#8220;Off Duty&#8221; or &#8220;Out of Service,&#8221; whichever
   is appropriate under these regulations, and turn off the cruising light. The
   operator shall enter on the manifest &#8220;Out of Service&#8221; or
   &#8220;Off Duty,&#8221; and the time and location; provided, that the
   &#8220;Off Duty&#8221; sign shall not be displayed during rush hours between
   7:00 a.m. and 9:30 a.m., and 4:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.

   820.4. All &#8220;On Call,&#8221; &#8220;Off Duty,&#8221; and &#8220;Out of
   Service&#8221; signs shall be displayed at the bottom of the right half of the
   windshield so as not to obstruct the operator&#8217;s vision. These signs
   shall be uniform in size and lettering, three inches by fifteen inches (3 in.
   x 15 in.) with letters two inches (2 in.) in height; provided, that the signs
   may be of a manufactured type and lighted from within, and may be smaller in
   dimension than three inches by fifteen inches (3 in. x 15 in.) when they have
   been approved by the Commission.

   820.5. &#8220;On Call,&#8221; &#8220;Off Duty,&#8221; and &#8220;Out of
   Service&#8221; signs, when not in use, shall be placed and secured in the
   taxicab vehicle so they are not readily accessible to the operator while the
   taxicab vehicle is available for hire.
