                                  DC REGULATIONS

GROUP RIDING AND SHARED RIDING (ยง 31-808)

808.1 	Group riding for pre-formed groups, as defined in ยง 899, is permitted
   at all times. No driver shall refuse to transport a pre-formed group at any
   time. Fares for group riding shall be calculated in accordance with ยง 801.8.

   808.2. Shared riding, as defined in ยง 899, is only permitted at Union
   Station, Verizon Center, and Nationals Park at such times as are determined to
   be necessary to achieve adequate service by a Starter employed or authorized
   by Union Station, Verizon Center, or Nationals Park. The following
   requirements shall apply to Shared Riding:
   
   
   
   (a)	The Starter shall have the sole authority to determine when a taxicab
   shall depart after taking on passengers, except that after an initial
   passenger has been taken on, the starter shall not unreasonably delay the
   departure of the taxicab for the purpose of securing additional passengers;
   
   (b)	The general direction of the destination of the first passenger shall
   determine the general direction of that particular trip.  Other passengers
   whose destinations lie generally in that direction may be transported to the
   extent of the design capacity of the taxicab;
   
   (c)	Passengers shall be discharged in the order of the arrival at their
   respective destinations.  In the event any questions arise as to the order of
   arrival at any destination, the question shall be resolved in favor of the
   passenger who entered the taxicab first; and
   
   (d)	Passengers have the right to refuse Shared Riding.

   808.3. Where Shared Riding is authorized in this chapter for Nationals Park,
   an operator shall not pick up a passenger except at the designated taxi stand
   nor discharge a passenger except at the designated discharge stand.  Nationals
   Park shall conspicuously post the designated taxi stand and discharge stands. 
   Violations of this subsection are subject to a fine of one hundred dollars
   ($100).
