                                  DC REGULATIONS

ADMISSION OF EVIDENCE (ยง 31-248)

248.1. The Federal Rules of Evidence as they have been construed by the courts
   of the District of Columbia shall be applied in hearings; provided, that the
   Panel may, after informing the parties of an intention to do so, relax those
   rules in any hearing when, in its judgment, the ends of justice would be
   better served by so doing.

   248.2. Formal exceptions to rulings of the Panel are unnecessary. It is
   sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling is made or sought, makes known
   the action which he or she desires to be taken, or his or her objection to an
   action taken, and his or her grounds for such action or objection.

   248.3. The Panel may, in its discretion, limit the cross cross-examination of
   any witness.

   248.4. Where written matter offered in evidence is embraced in a document
   containing another matter which is not intended to be offered in evidence, the
   offering party shall present the original document for inspection at the
   hearing, and shall offer an exact copy of the matter which is to be
   introduced, unless the presiding officer, or the Panel, determines that the
   matter is short enough to be read into the record. Other parties shall be
   afforded opportunity to introduce in evidence, in like manner, other portions
   of the original document.

   248.5. When any portion of the record before the Panel in any proceeding other
   than the one being heard, or any portion of any other official record of the
   Commission or of the Panel, is offered in evidence, true copies of that
   portion shall be presented for the record in the form of an exhibit, or that
   portion may, without objection, be incorporated in the record by reference.
