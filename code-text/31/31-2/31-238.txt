   general description of the matters concerning which the witness will be asked
   to testify.

   238.2. For good cause shown, the Chairperson may, in his or her discretion,
   issue an order authorizing the deposition and specifying the witness whose
   deposition is to be taken, the general scope of the testimony to be taken, the
   time when, the place where, and the designated officer (authorized to
   administer oaths) before whom the witness is to testify, and the number of
   copies of the deposition to be supplied.

   238.3. The order shall be served upon all parties within a reasonable time in

   grounds of objection relied upon, but no transcript filed by the officer shall
   include argument or debate.

   238.7. Objections to questions or evidence shall be noted by the officer upon
   the deposition, but he or she shall have no power to decide on the competency
   or materiality or relevance of evidence, and he or she shall record the
   evidence subject to objection.

   238.8. Objections to questions or evidence not made before the officer shall
   not be deemed waived unless the ground of the objection is one which might
   have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.

   238.9. The testimony shall be reduced to writing by the officer, or under his
   or her direction, after which the deposition shall be subscribed to by the

   instance the deposition is taken.

   admissible in evidence or that it may be used in the proceeding.

   238.15. Only that part or the whole of a deposition which is received in
   evidence at a hearing shall constitute a part of the record in the proceeding
   upon which a decision is based.
