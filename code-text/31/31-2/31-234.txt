                                  DC REGULATIONS

COMPUTATION OF TIME (§ 31-234)

234.1. When, by notice given under §§ 220 to 256, and 299, or by order or
   decision of the Panel, an act is required or allowed to be done at or within a
   specified time, the Panel for cause shown may, at any time in its discretion,
   do either of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	With or without motion or notice, order the period enlarged if request
   therefor is made before the expiration of the period originally prescribed or
   as extended by a previous order; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Upon motion made after expiration of the specified period, permit the act
   to be done where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect and
   only then in extraordinary cases where the denial of an enlargement of time
   would operate to deny a person adversely affected thereby any opportunity to
   notice and hearing.

   234.2. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by §§ 220 to
   256 and 299, by notice, order, rule, of the Commission, Panel, Office, by
   statute, the day of the act, event, or default after which the designated
   period of time begins to run is not to be included.

   234.3. The last day of the period so computed shall be included unless it is a
   Saturday, Sunday, or during the period of time described in § 202.2, in which
   event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday,
   Sunday, or during the period of time described in § 202.2.

   234.4. Whenever a party has the right or is required to take action within the
   period prescribed by §§ 220 to 256 and 299, by a notice given thereunder, or
   by an order or regulation, the Panel may, before the expiration of the
   prescribed period, with or without notice, extend the period; or, upon motion,
   permit the act to be done after the expiration of the specified period, where
   the failure to act is clearly shown to have been the result of excusable
   neglect.
