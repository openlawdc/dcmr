                                  DC REGULATIONS

EXHIBITS (ยง 31-247)

247.1. All direct and rebuttal testimony shall be prepared in the form of
   written exhibits.

   247.2. All revisions and corrections to case-in-chief and rebuttal exhibits
   shall be presented by way of replacement pages and submitted no later than
   three (3) business days prior to the beginning of hearings. Only the
   correction of minor typographical errors shall be allowed after the period.

   247.3. The title of each exhibit shall state concisely what the exhibit
   contains.

   247.4. Exhibits containing prepared written testimony shall contain line
   numbers on each page, in the left-hand margin. This testimony shall be
   authenticated by an appropriate affidavit of the witness. An exhibit
   containing rebuttal testimony shall also include the exhibit, page, and line
   numbers of the evidence that it purports to rebut.

   247.5. Case-in-Chief exhibits and rebuttal exhibits shall be served on each
   party, and twenty (20) copies shall be filed with the Secretary for use by the
   Panel and the staff of the Commission. In addition, one (1) copy shall be sent
   to the General Counsel.

   247.6. Each party shall, for the formal record, submit by 9:00 a.m. on the
   first hearing date in each case one (1) fully corrected set of its
   case-in-chief and rebuttal exhibits.

   247.7. Narrative testimony and exhibits shall be identified prior to filing as
   follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	The name of the party shall be set forth on each exhibit in the form of an
   acronym or initials;
   
   
   
   (b)	When the document to be filed is the testimony of a witness, each set of
   the testimony shall, following the party&#8217;s initials, bear a letter (in
   upper case); thus, the first witness of a particular party shall have his or
   her testimony identified, for example, as &#8220;DOE&#8221; (A); the second
   witness, &#8220;DOE&#8221; (B), and so on. Each witness shall retain the same
   letter, however, the first witness&#8217;s second set of testimony shall be
   lettered (2A) and so on;
   
   
   
   (c)	If there is an exhibit attached to the testimony of the witness, that
   exhibit shall bear an Arabic number. Thus, the first exhibit of the first
   witness would be marked, for example &#8220;DOE&#8221; (A)-1. His or her
   second exhibit shall be marked, for example, &#8220;DOE&#8221; (A)-2, and so
   on. Any exhibit attached to the second set of testimony of a witness would be
   marked, for example, &#8220;DOE&#8221; (2A)-1; and
   
   
   
   (d)	If there is no testimony submitted with the exhibit, then the exhibit
   shall merely bear the capitalized initials of the party and be numbered
   sequentially with Arabic numbers (e.g., &#8220;DOE&#8221;-1).

   247.8. The Panel may, at the hearing, sequentially number all exhibits by the
   insertion of a prefix number before the letters of the party.

   247.9. Not later than 9:00 a.m., of the morning of a hearing, there shall be
   provided to all parties and Commissioners a list of all cross-examination
   exhibits that the party proposes to introduce on the record. This list shall
   be accompanied by copies of those exhibits.

   247.10. As subsequent filings are made, the list of cross-examination exhibits
   shall be cumulatively updated. Any party proposing to use a document in
   examination of a witness shall have it marked for identification and shall
   distribute copies to the Panel, for the record, and to the parties by 9:00
   a.m., the day of the hearing.

   247.11. The list of cross-examination exhibits shall contain the following
   information:
   
   
   
   (a)	The caption and docket number of the case;
   
   
   
   (b)	A title showing the party proponent of the list and the date of the list
   and the date of the list it supersedes, if any;
   
   
   
   (c)	The designation of the document in letters and numbers as the first
   column; and
   
   
   
   (d)	A description of the document in the second column.
