                                  DC REGULATIONS

DENIAL OF LICENSE AND REAPPLICATION (§ 31-1006)

1006.1. An applicant who has been denied a license to operate a public vehicle
   for hire for reasons other than for failure to complete successfully an
   examination may file a new application for a license after the expiration of
   not less than six (6) months after the denial, unless the denial is reversed
   by the Office of Administrative Hearings.

   1006.2. If an applicant files an appeal from a denial with the Office of
   Administrative Hearings and the Chairperson’s denial is sustained, or if an
   operator’s license has been suspended or revoked by the Commission and
   sustained, no new application may be made until the expiration of any waiting,
   suspension, or revocation period imposed.

   1006.3. The decision of the Commission shall not be stayed during the pendency
   of an appeal to the Office of Administrative Hearings, unless the Office of
   Administrative Hearings issues an order imposing a stay.

   1006.4. In determining the fitness of an applicant under § 1009 (Not for
   Hire), the Chairperson shall not take into account the conduct or record of
   the applicant upon which the waiting period was based. The determination of
   fitness shall be based on the conduct or the record of the applicant&#8217;s
   conduct during and after the waiting period. If the personal conduct during
   the waiting period satisfies the personal conduct and other requirements of
   this chapter, the Chairperson may issue a license to the applicant.

   1006.5. If the Chairperson discovers information not previously known to him
   or her, which relates to the moral character, fitness, or eligibility of the
   applicant and was not a part of the record in the proceeding of the Office of
   Administrative Hearings, the Chairperson may find on the basis of that
   information, that the moral character, fitness, or eligibility of the
   applicant is such that it does not justify the issuance of the license and may
   again deny the issuance of a license.  The applicant may appeal this denial to
   the Office of Administrative Hearings.

   1006.6. The Chairperson shall establish repeat examinations for applicants who
   are denied licenses because of failing the qualifying examination under the
   provisions of § 1004. Repeat examinations shall be scheduled to permit a fair
   opportunity for applicants to successfully complete the examination.  If an
   applicant fails to pass the examination after three (3) attempts, the
   applicant must re-take the operator’s training course before being allowed
   to take the examination again.
