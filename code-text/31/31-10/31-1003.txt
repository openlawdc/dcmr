                                  DC REGULATIONS

HEALTH REQUIREMENTS (§ 31-1003)

1003.1. Each application (including a renewal application) shall be
   accompanied by a certificate from a licensed physician who is a resident of
   the Metropolitan Area, certifying that, in the opinion of that physician, the
   applicant does not have any physical or mental disability or disease which
   might make him or her an unsafe driver of a public vehicle for hire.

   1003.2. The form of the physician&#8217;s certificate shall be prescribed by
   the Chairperson and shall provide for any additional information relating to
   the applicant&#8217;s past or present medical history as the Chairperson may
   consider necessary.

   1003.3. The certificate shall be executed by the certifying physician within
   thirty (30) days of the date of filing of the application.

   1003.4. Each application (including a renewal application) shall also be
   accompanied by a certificate signed by the applicant on a form prescribed by
   the Chairperson certifying that, to the best of the applicant&#8217;s
   knowledge and belief, he or she has no disease or disability which would
   render him or her unsafe or unsatisfactory as a driver of a public vehicle.
   The form may provide for additional information relating to the
   applicant&#8217;s past or present medical history or condition.

   1003.5. Each applicant shall have central visual acuity of at least 20/40 in
   one eye, either unassisted or assisted by glasses or contact lens, and shall
   have hearing of at least 10/20 in one ear.

   1003.6. No applicant shall be considered for a license if, at the time the
   application is filed, the applicant is suffering from a contagious disease,
   epilepsy, vertigo, fainting spells, blackouts, attacks of dizziness, or other
   medical condition that in the opinion of the Chairperson may render the
   applicant unsafe or unsatisfactory as a driver of a public vehicle.

   1003.7. A license shall not be issued, or renewed, under this chapter to a
   person who has a mental disability or disease that would negatively impact his
   or her ability to meet the requirements of this chapter with respect to the
   operation of a taxicab, unless he or she provides a certificate from a
   licensed physician who is a resident of the Metropolitan Area certifying that,
   in the opinion of that physician, the person’s mental disability or disease,
   as may be currently treated, does not negatively impact his or her ability to
   meet the requirements of this chapter with respect to the operation of a
   taxicab.  If the person’s mental disability or disease, or his or her
   treatment, substantially changes during the period of licensure, he or she
   shall provide a re-certification from a physician who is a resident of the
   Metropolitan Area or shall immediately surrender his or her license to the
   Commission.
