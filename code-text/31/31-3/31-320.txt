                                  DC REGULATIONS

GENERAL PROVISIONS REGARDING ADJUDICATORY PROCEEDINGS AND COMPUTATION OF TIME
(§ 31-320)

320.1. The rules of procedure set forth in §§ 320 to 355 and 399 shall
   govern the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The form, content, and filing of pleadings in cases heard by the Panel and
   by hearing panels;
   
   
   
   (b)	Any intraindustry complaints and disputes;
   
   
   
   (c)	The petitions for declaratory orders; and
   
   
   
   (d)	The final determination of the policy of the Commission or of the Office
   in any case in which the rights, duties, or privileges of any person are in
   issue.

   320.2. In any case where the Act or Administrative Procedure Act provides a
   procedure inconsistent with this chapter, the Act or Administrative Procedure
   Act shall govern to the extent of such inconsistency.

   320.3. If in any case the forms set out in §§ 328, 329, and 333 to 342 are
   found to be inappropriate, parties may devise forms substantially similar to
   those herein prescribed to meet such situations.

   320.4. When, by notice given under §§ 320 to 358 and 399, or by order or
   decision of the Panel or a hearing panel, an act is required or allowed to be
   done at or within a specified time, the hearing panel for cause shown may, at
   any time in its discretion, do either of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	With or without motion or notice, order the period enlarged if request
   therefor is made before the expiration of the period originally prescribed or
   as extended by a previous order; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Upon motion made after expiration of the specified period, permit the act
   to be done where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect and
   only then in extraordinary cases where the denial of an enlargement of time
   would operate to deny a person adversely affected thereby any opportunity to
   notice and hearing.

   320.5. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this §§ 320
   to 358 and 399, by notice, order, or rule, of the Commission, Panel, or
   Office, or by statute, the day of the act, event, or default after which the
   designated period of time begins to run is not to be included.

   320.6. The last day of the period so computed shall be included unless it is a
   Saturday, Sunday, or during the period of time described in § 302.2, in which
   event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday,
   Sunday, or during the period of time described in § 302.2.

   320.7. Whenever a party has the right or is required to take action within the
   period prescribed by §§ 320 to 358 and 399, by a notice given thereunder, or
   by an order or regulation, the Panel or a hearing panel may, before the
   expiration of the prescribed period, with or without notice, extend the
   period; or, upon motion, permit the act to be done after the expiration of the
   specified period, where the failure to act is clearly shown to have been the
   result of excusable neglect.
