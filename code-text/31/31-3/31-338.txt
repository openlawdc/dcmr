   general description of the matters concerning which the witness will be asked
   to testify.

   338.2. If good cause be shown, the Chairperson may, in his or her discretion,
   issue an order authorizing the deposition and specifying the witness whose
   deposition is to be taken, the general scope of the testimony to be taken, the
   time when, the place where, and the designated officer (authorized to take
   oaths) before whom the witness is to testify, and the number of copies of the

   include argument or debate.

   338.7. Objections to questions or evidence shall be noted by the officer upon

   or materiality or relevance of evidence, and he or she shall record the
   evidence subject to objection.

   338.8. Objections to questions or evidence not made before the officer shall
   not be deemed waived unless the ground of the objection is one which might
   have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.

   338.9. The testimony shall be reduced to writing by the officer, or under his

   338.15. Only that part or the whole of a deposition which is received in
   evidence at a hearing shall constitute a part of the record in the proceeding
   upon which a decision is based.
