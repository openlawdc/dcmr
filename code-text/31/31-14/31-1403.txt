   		(a)	Remit a payment to the District as directed by the Office at the end of
   each seven (7) day period reflecting the sum of all sedan passenger surcharges
   owed to the Office for trips made during such period, based on the trip data
   provided during such period, and sending contemporaneously via email a report
   to the Office certifying its payment and providing a basis for the amount
   thereof; and
   
   
   
   		(b)	Cooperate with the Office in the event of a discrepancy between a
   payment and the trip data from the digital payment system, provided however,
   that if the DDS and Office are unable to agree on a resolution of a dispute

   digital payment system to no longer be approved; provided, however, that the
   bond shall not be returned while there remains a discrepancy in the amount
   owed for sedan passenger surcharges, or during such time that the bond is
   required to be maintained with the Office pursuant to Chapter 4 of this title
   in connection with the operation of a payment service provider for taxicabs.
