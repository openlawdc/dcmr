                                  DC REGULATIONS

PRE-ELECTION LOGIC AND ACCURACY TESTING (§ 3-801)

801.1. In preparation for any election, Board employees shall conduct complete
   testing of the automatic tabulation system before the use of the system.

   801.2. Before each election, every unit of voting equipment shall be subject
   to public testing referred to as logic and accuracy testing (“L&#038;A
   testing”).

   801.3. Notice of the L&#038;A testing period shall be provided to candidates,
   proponents and opponents of measures, party officials, the news media, and to
   any other public representatives the Board deems appropriate, at least seven
   (7) days before the L&#038;A testing period begins.

   801.4. Notice of the final public L&#038;A test shall be provided to
   candidates, proponents and opponents of measures, party officials, the news
   media, and to any other public representatives the Board deems appropriate, at
   least forty-eight (48) hours before the final public L&#038;A test shall
   occur.

   801.5. An L&#038;A test shall verify the conditions required of the voting
   equipment, and that each unit of voting equipment is correctly configured for
   the specifics of that election.  Conditions required of the voting equipment
   are:
   
   
   
   (a)  	Each unit of voting equipment contains correct ballot information,
   including the names or texts of all applicable candidates, contests, and
   ballot questions;
   
   
   
   (b)  	Tabulation is accurate and consistent; and
   
   (c)  	All required components of the voting equipment, including
   specifications mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42
   U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq., are functional.

   801.6. Each unit of voting equipment shall be tested by recording test votes
   from a predetermined script, verifying that it is possible to vote for each
   candidate or each answer to a question on the ballot, and that these votes are
   tabulated correctly.

   801.7. The predetermined script shall include valid votes, overvotes, and
   blank votes for each candidate and each answer to a ballot question.

   801.8. Equipment shall not be approved unless it produces the exact count of
   the predetermined script, rejects all improper votes, and meets all other test
   criteria.  If a unit of voting equipment fails L&#038;A testing, it shall not
   be used in the election and shall be subject to review.

   801.9. The final public L&#038;A test shall conclude by setting all vote
   totals to zero and emptying the physical or electronic ballot boxes, and then
   sealing the systems prior to their official use for the election.

   801.10. After the final public L&#038;A test has been successfully completed,
   all test votes, test results, and the computer programs tested shall be kept
   in sealed containers and shall not be removed from such containers except in
   the presence of two or more witnesses not affiliated with the Board, or two
   (2) or more credentialed election observers or poll watchers not of the same
   political party or organizational affiliation.

   801.11. The voting equipment configuration tested during the L&#038;A testing
   period shall be the same configuration used during the early voting period and
   on Election Day.
