                                  DC REGULATIONS

VALIDITY OF VOTES (§ 3-803)

803.1. Overvotes or otherwise improper votes shall be deemed invalid and not
   counted.  Improper votes shall include, but are not limited to, votes which
   the voter is not lawfully able to cast.

   803.2. Any overvote or otherwise improper vote in one (1) or more contests
   shall not invalidate the entire ballot but only the votes cast in that
   contest. All correctly cast votes on such a ballot shall be counted. The
   number of votes rejected because of overvote or otherwise improper vote shall
   be reported.

   803.3. An undervote shall not invalidate the entire ballot, except that a
   ballot cast without any marks shall not be tallied.  If a voter fails to mark
   a choice for a contest or ballot question, only those contests and questions
   that were unmarked shall not be counted.

   803.4. A write-in vote shall not be adjudged valid, and shall not be tallied
   and recorded, unless the voter has written, or used a stamp to imprint, the
   name of the write-in candidate on a blank line provided for write-in voting
   and has not marked the voting position on an equal number of votes allowed for
   that office.  Any write-in vote cast using a sticker or adhesive label shall
   be invalid.

   803.5. When a voter writes a person&#8217;s name in the proper space for
   write-ins for an office, it is a vote for that person, notwithstanding:
   
   
   
   (a)	The appearance of that person&#8217;s name in pre-printed form on the
   ballot as a candidate for the same office;
   
   
   
   (b)	The voter&#8217;s failure to fill in the empty oval which appears to the
   left of the candidate&#8217;s pre-printed name; or
   
   
   
   (c)	The voter&#8217;s failure to fill in the empty oval which appears to the
   left of the space designated for write-in candidates.

   803.6. In the case of a write-in vote, no ballot should be regarded as
   defective due to unclear writing, misspelling of a candidate’s name, or by
   abbreviation, addition, omission or use of a wrong initial in the name, so
   long as voter intent can be determined.

   803.7. If a voter circles a candidate’s name, draws an arrow pointing to a
   candidate&#8217;s name, circles the empty oval to the left of the
   candidate&#8217;s name, uses a check, asterisk, or any other mark in a manner
   that clearly indicates his or her intended choice, the vote shall count as a
   vote for that candidate, provided, that the mark is not a distinguishing mark
   as defined in § 803.9.

   803.8. A ballot properly marked by filling in the empty oval to the left of
   the candidate or ballot question is valid even though it contains an
   additional mark, provided that the additional mark is not a distinguishing
   mark as defined in § 803.9.

   803.9. A distinguishing mark is a mark (whether a letter, figure, or
   character) that serves to separate and distinguish a particular ballot from
   other ballots cast at the election. The mark itself shall be to furnish
   evidence of an unlawful intention on the part of the voter to identify the
   ballot after the vote has been cast, such as the voter&#8217;s initials, or a
   mark known to belong to the voter.
