                                  DC REGULATIONS

ABSENTEE BALLOT TABULATION (§ 3-808)

808.1. The provisions of this section shall govern the tabulation of absentee
   ballots submitted to the Board electronically or by mail, or those delivered
   to an early voting center or polling place on Election Day.

   808.2. The handling and tabulation of absentee ballots shall:
   
   
   
   (a)  	Be conducted separately from the tabulation of all other ballots;
   
   (b) 	 Be conducted publicly; and
   
   (c)  	Otherwise be conducted in the same manner as non-absentee regular
   ballots, insofar as those procedures do not conflict with the provisions of
   this section.

   808.3. Absentee ballots received by the Board prior to the close of business
   on the Friday preceding an election shall be tabulated after polls have closed
   on Election Day.  Absentee ballots received after the Friday preceding an
   election shall be secured and tabulated ten (10) days after an election.

   808.4. Prior to tabulation, the Executive Director’s designee shall verify
   that the voter signed the absentee ballot envelope.

   808.5. In preparation for tabulation, the Executive Director’s designee
   shall open the outer mailing envelopes, and remove the inner secrecy envelope
   which contains the absentee ballot.  Inner secrecy envelopes shall be sorted
   by ward and precinct.

   808.6. Working precinct by precinct, the Executive Director’s designee
   shall:
   
   
   
   (a)  	Open the inner secrecy envelopes, being careful not to damage the ballot
   inside.  If an absentee ballot is damaged in this process, the valid votes
   shall be reproduced on duplicate ballots, in accordance with the rules of this
   chapter; and
   
   (b)  	Inspect the absentee ballots for machine tabulation acceptability.  All
   absentee ballots that are identified as not being machine readable shall be
   removed and reproduced on duplicate ballots in accordance with the rules of
   this chapter.

   808.7. The absentee ballot shall be tabulated and counted as being cast in the
   ward and precinct in which the voter resides.
