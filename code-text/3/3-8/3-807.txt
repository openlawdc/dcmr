807.1. The review and tabulation of Special Ballots shall:
   
   
   
   (a)  	Be conducted separately from the review and tabulation of all other
   ballots;
   
   (b)  	Be conducted publicly; and
   
   (c)  	Otherwise be conducted in the same manner as regular ballots, insofar as
   those procedures do not conflict with the provisions of this section.

   807.2. All Special Ballot Envelopes shall remain sealed until the voter’s
   eligibility has been preliminarily determined by the Executive Director.

   807.3. A Special Ballot shall be eligible to be tabulated when the Executive
   Director has determined that:
   
   
   
   (a)  	If the voter registered to vote at the polls or an early voting center,
   the voter cast the Special Ballot at the precinct in which the voter maintains
   residence or at an early voting center designated by the Board;
   
   (b)  	The voter is a qualified elector of the District of Columbia; and
   
   (c)  	The voter did not otherwise vote in the same election.

   807.4. Not later than the first (1st) Tuesday following each election, the
   Executive Director shall issue preliminary determinations to count or reject
   each Special Ballot cast during an election.

   807.5. The Executive Director or his or her designee shall record on the back
   of the Special Ballot Envelope whether the Special Ballot was accepted, either
   in full or in part, or rejected and, if rejected, the reason why the Special
   Ballot was rejected.

   807.6. If the Executive Director rejects a Special Ballot, the Special Ballot
   Envelope shall remain sealed.  All rejected Special Ballots, Special Ballot
   Envelopes, along with any voter eligibility information gathered shall be
   enclosed in containers marked with the words “Rejected Special Ballots and
   Envelopes” and the date of the election.  Pursuant to § 715, the voter may
   appeal to the Board the Executive Director’s preliminary determination to
   reject the voter’s Special Ballot.

   807.7. All Special Ballots cast by voters whose eligibility has been verified
   shall be tabulated on the tenth (10th) day following an election, in
