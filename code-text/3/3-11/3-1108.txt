                                  DC REGULATIONS

POSTING OF RECALL PETITIONS (ยง 3-1108)

1108.1. The Board shall post all recall petitions, or facsimiles thereof,
   except those petitions to recall a member of an Advisory Neighborhood
   Commission (ANC), in its office for public inspection for ten (10) days,
   including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, beginning on the third (3rd) day
   after the filing deadline required by law.  For petitions to recall an ANC,
   the ten (10)-day period shall not include Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.

   1108.2. Any qualified elector may within the ten (10)-day posting period
   challenge the validity of any petition by filing with the Board a written
   statement that concisely specifies the alleged defect(s) in the petition and
   is duly signed by the challenger.

   1108.3. A qualified elector may also challenge the validity of a recall
   petition by citing the exact provision(s) in the Board&#8217;s regulations
   upon which the challenge is based.  For example, if the ground upon which a
   signature is challenged is that the signature is not dated, such challenge
   shall be expressed as follows: &#8220;3 DCMR ยง 1106.12(d)&#8221;.

   1108.4. The Board shall not accept any challenge which, on its face, does not
   allege defects in the petition which, if valid, would render the proposed
   measure ineligible for ballot access.

   1108.5. The Board may, on its own motion, dismiss a petition challenge where
   the total number of challenged signatures would not reduce the total number of
   signatures submitted by the proposer(s) below the required statutory amount.

   1108.6. Within three (3) working days of receipt of a challenge, the Board
   shall serve in person, by certified mail, or email a copy of the challenge
   upon the proposer of the measure.

   1108.7. The Board shall receive evidence in support of and in opposition to
   the challenge and shall determine the validity of the challenged petition not
   more than twenty (20) days after the challenge has been filed.

   1108.8. Petition challenges shall be adjudicated in accordance with the
   procedures prescribed in Chapter 4 of this title.

   1108.9. In the event a petition challenge is filed with the Board, the
   permanent registration records of the Board shall be searched by members of
   its staff and those staff persons shall be made available as witnesses to
   either party.

   1108.10. The scope of the search shall be limited to matters raised in the
   petition challenge, including but not limited to, the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Whether the signer is a duly registered elector;
   
   
   
   (b)	Whether the signature is that of a registered elector whose name appears
   on the petition; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Whether the signer is a resident of the applicable ward or Advisory
   Neighborhood Commission Single-Member District.

   1108.11. In the event the Board discovers a fatal defect either on the face of
   a petition or pursuant to a record search concerning a specific allegation or
   challenge, the Board may, on its own motion, declare the signature invalid,
   notwithstanding the defect was not alleged or challenged.

   1108.12. The Board shall consider any other evidence as may be submitted,
   including but not limited to, documentary evidence, affidavits, and oral
   testimony.

   1108.13. The Board, in view of the fact that it shall hear and determine the
   validity of the challenged petition within a limited time, may limit
   examination and cross-examination of witnesses to the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Objections and specifications of such objections, if any, to the recall
   petition; and
   
   
   
   (b)		Objections and specifications of such objections, if any, to the petition
   challenge.

   1108.14. Within three (3) days after announcement of the determination of the
   Board with respect to the validity of a petition, either the challenger or the
   proposer of the measure may apply to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals
   for a review of the reasonableness of such determination. The Court shall
   expedite consideration of the matter and the decision of such Court shall be
   final and not appealable.
