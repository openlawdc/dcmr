ACCEPTANCE OF PETITIONS AND VERIFICATION OF SIGNATURES (§ 3-1105)

1105.1. If none of the grounds for refusal specified in § 1104 exist, the
   petition shall be accepted for filing as of the date of submission.

   1105.2. Upon the acceptance of a recall petition for filing, whether in the
   normal course or at the direction of the court, the Board shall certify within
   thirty (30) calendar days whether the petition contains the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	A sufficient number of valid signatures which meets the qualifying
   percentage and ward distribution requirements; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The necessary number of names and signatures of registered qualified
   electors of the District of Columbia, properly distributed by ward.

   1105.3. The Board shall verify the signatures appearing on a recall petition
   by performing a bona fide random and statistical sampling under the guidance
   of the Data Services Division of the Office of Planning.

   1105.4. Petitions shall be accepted or rejected based on the number of valid
   signatures in the random sample.

   1105.5. In the case of a citywide recall petition, a sample of one hundred
   (100) signatures shall be drawn from the total number of verified registrants
   signatures filed for each election ward.

   1105.6. In the case of a ward or school district recall petition, the Board of
   Elections and Ethics shall supply the Data Services Division with the total
   number of verified registrants signatures filed for the ward or school
   district. From this universe, the Data Services Division shall determine the
   size of the random sample to be drawn.

   1105.7. The Board shall report the number of valid signatures in each ward
   sample to the Data Services Division.  The Data Services shall then determine
   the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Whether a ward should be accepted as having the required number of valid
   signatures;
   
   
   
   (b)	Whether a ward should be rejected as not having the required number of
   valid signatures; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Whether a larger sample should be drawn since no decision could be made
   from the one used.

   1105.8. A ninety-five percent (95%) confidence probability shall be used in
   ward sample designs.

   1105.9. A ward shall be accepted if the Board is ninety-five percent (95%)
   confident that the total number of valid signatures from that ward equals or
   exceeds the required number.

   1105.10. A ward shall be rejected if the Board is ninety-five percent (95%)
   confident that the total number of valid signatures from that ward is less
   than the required number.

   1105.11. If it is determined that five (5) of the eight (8) election wards
   have the required number of valid signatures, the figures from all eight (8)
   election wards shall be combined to test whether the entire number of valid
   signatures appearing on the petition is equal in number to five percent (5%)
   of the registered electors in the District of Columbia.

   1105.12. Standard formulas from the field of stratified random sampling shall
   be employed by the Data Services Division in conducting the citywide test and
   shall take as input the results of the signature validation of the separate
   wards.  The output shall determine the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Whether the signature requirements for the entire District were met;
   
   
   
   (b)	Whether the signature requirements for the entire District were not met;
   or
   
   
   
   (c)	Whether a larger sample should be drawn in the event no decision could be
   made based upon the sample used.

   1105.13. A ninety-five percent (95%) confidence probability shall be used in
   the entire District of Columbia sample design.

   1105.14. The entire District shall be rejected if the Board is ninety-five
   percent (95%) confident that the total number of signatures from the entire
   District is less than the required number.
