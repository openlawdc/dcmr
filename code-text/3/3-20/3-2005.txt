                                  DC REGULATIONS

TIME LIMITATIONS (§ 3-2005)

2005.1. Within ten (10) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public
   holidays) of the receipt of a request, the Board shall determine whether to
   comply with or to deny the request and shall dispatch its determination to the
   requester, unless an extension is made pursuant to §§ 2005.2 and 2005.3.

   2005.2. In unusual circumstances as specified in § 2005.3, the Board may
   extend the time for initial determination on a request up to a total of ten
   (10) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays).

   2005.3. Extensions shall be made by written notice to the requester which sets
   forth the reason for the extension and the date on which a determination is
   expected. As used in this section &#8220;unusual circumstances&#8221; means,
   but only to the extent necessary to the proper processing of the request,
   either of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous
   amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single
   request; or
   
   
   
   (b)	The need for consultation with another agency having a substantial
   interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components
   of the agency having substantial subject matter interest therein.

   2005.4. If no determination has been dispatched at the end of the ten-day
   period, or the extension thereof, the requester may deem his request denied,
   and exercise a right to appeal in accordance with § 2012.1.

   2005.5. When no determination can be dispatched within the applicable time
   limit, the Board shall nevertheless continue to process the request. On
   expiration of the time limit the Board shall inform the requester of the
   reason for the delay, of the date on which a determination may be expected,
   and of his right to treat the delay as a denial and of the appeal rights
   provided by the Act. The Board may ask the requester to forego appeal until a
   determination is made.
