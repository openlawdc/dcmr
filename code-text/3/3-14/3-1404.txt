                                  DC REGULATIONS

POSTING OF NOMINATING PETITIONS (§ 3-1404)

1404.1. The Board shall post nominating petitions, or facsimiles thereof, in
   its office for public inspection for ten (10) days, including Saturdays,
   Sundays, and holidays, beginning on the third (3rd) day after the filing
   deadline required by law.

   1404.2. Any qualified elector may within the ten (10)-day posting period
   challenge the validity of any petition by filing with the Board a written
   statement that concisely specifies the alleged defect(s) in the petition and
   is duly signed by the challenger.

   1404.3. A qualified elector may also challenge the validity of a nominating
   petition by citing the exact provision(s) in the Board&#8217;s regulations
   upon which the challenge is based.  For example, if the ground upon which a
   signature is challenged is that the signature is not dated, such challenge
   shall be expressed as follows: &#8220;3 DCMR § 1402.5(d)”.

   1404.4. The Board shall not accept any challenge which, on its face, does not
   allege defects in the petition which, if valid, would render the prospective
   candidate ineligible.

   1404.5. The Board may, on its own motion, dismiss a petition challenge where
   the total number of challenged signatures would not reduce the total number of
   signatures submitted by the proposer(s) below the required statutory amount.

   1404.6. Within three (3) working days of receipt of a challenge, the Board
   shall serve in person, by certified mail, or email a copy of the challenge
   upon the candidate.

   1404.7. The Board shall receive evidence in support of and in opposition to
   the challenge and shall determine the validity of the challenged petition no
   more than twenty (20) days after the challenge has been filed.

   1404.8. Petition challenges shall be adjudicated in accordance with the
   procedures prescribed in chapter 4 of this title.

   1404.9. In the event a petition challenge is filed with the Board, the
   permanent registration records of the Board shall be searched by members of
   its staff and those staff persons shall be made available as witnesses to
   either party.

   1404.10. The scope of the search shall be limited to matters raised in the
   petition challenge, including but not limited to, the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Whether the signer is a duly registered elector;
   
   
   
   (b)	Whether the signature is that of a registered elector whose name appears
   on the petition; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Whether the signer is a resident of the applicable ward or registered with
   the applicable political party.

   1404.11. In the event the Board discovers a fatal defect either on the face of
   a petition or pursuant to a record search concerning a specific allegation or
   challenge, the Board may, on its own motion, declare the signature invalid,
   notwithstanding the defect was not alleged or challenged.

   1404.12. The Board shall consider any other evidence as may be submitted,
   including but not limited to, documentary evidence, affidavits, and oral
   testimony.

   1404.13. The Board, in view of the fact that it shall hear and determine the
   validity of the challenged petition within a limited time, may limit
   examination and cross-examination of witnesses to the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Objections and specifications of such objections, if any, to the
   nominating petition; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Objections and specifications of such objections, if any, to the petition
   challenge.

   1404.14. If the Board upholds the validity of the petition, it shall certify
   the candidate and the candidate’s name shall be printed on the official
   election ballot.

   1404.15. If a one (1)-member Board panel makes a determination on the validity
   of a challenged nominating petition, either the challenger or any person named
   in the challenged petition as a nominee may apply to either the full Board or
   the District of Columbia Court of Appeals for a review of such determination
   within three (3) days after the announcement of the one (1)-member panel
   determination; provided that any appeal to the full Board must be made in time
   to permit the Board to resolve the matter by no later than twenty (20) days
   after the challenge has been filed.  An appeal from a full Board determination
   to the Court of Appeals shall be made within three (3) days.

   1404.16. If at the expiration of the challenge period referred to in this
   section, no challenge has been filed with respect to a nominating petition,
   the Executive Director, or his or her designee, shall certify the candidate
   and the candidate’s name shall be printed on the ballot.
