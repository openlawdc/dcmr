   for the office to which he or she has been nominated.

   1405.2. In the event the affidavit is received less than forty-five (45) days
   before the next election, the name of that person may appear on the official

   withdrawal, if the Board determines that it is impracticable to exclude the
   person’s name.

   1405.3. In the event the affidavit is received more than forty-five (45) days

   shall be selected in accordance with the rules of the political party, in
   order to maintain a full slate of delegates.

   1405.4. Notice shall be given to the electorate in the affected precincts
   which informs voters of the withdrawal of the nomination for office by
   candidates whose names appear on the ballot or separate handout which is given
   to the voter with the ballot.

   1405.5. The Board may remove from the ballot the name of any presidential
   candidate, and the names of the delegate candidates pledged in support of that
   candidate, who publicly withdraws as a candidate for president.
