VALIDITY OF SIGNATURES ON PETITIONS (§ 3-1009)

1009.1. The signature on a petition shall be made by the person whose
   signature it purports to be and not by any other person.

   1009.2. Registered voters who are unable to sign their names may make their
   marks in the space provided for signatures. These marks shall not be counted
   as valid signatures unless the person(s) witnessing the marks has attached an
   affidavit to the petition, wherein it is stated that the contents of the
   petition were explained to the signatory and that the affiant witnessed their
   marks.

   1009.3. The petition shall also contain the signer’s printed or typed name,
   residence address at which the signer is registered to vote as shown on the
   Board’s records, ward number, and the date signed.

   1009.4. A signature may not be counted as valid unless all required
   information is provided.

   1009.5. If a person has signed an initiative or referendum petition more than
   once, only one (1) signature shall be counted for that person.

   1009.6. The circulator of a petition page may not act as witness to his or her
   own petition signature on that page.

   1009.7. If a person who has signed a petition is a qualified registered
   elector in a ward other than that which was indicated on the petition sheet,
   that person’s signature shall be counted from the proper ward in which he or
   she resides.

   1009.8. When some but not all signatures on a petition have been signed
   outside the presence of the circulator, only those signatures signed outside
   the circulator’s presence shall be invalid, and the remaining signatures on
   the sheet shall be deemed valid if there are no other defects in the
   signatures.

   1009.9. In addition to the signature of the registered voter, the petition
   shall contain the voter’s current residence address and the date the voter
   signed the petition.

   requirements set forth in § 1005.1 at the time the petition was signed.

   1009.11. For the purposes of this section, a &#8220;duly registered
   voter&#8221; shall be a registered qualified elector who is registered to vote
   at the address listed on the petition as shown on the Board’s voter
   registration records and whose registration is not designated
   &#8220;inactive&#8221; on the voter roll at the time the petition is signed.

   1009.12. A registered voter may submit a written notarized request to the
