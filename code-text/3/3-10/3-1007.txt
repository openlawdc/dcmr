                                  DC REGULATIONS

REGISTRATION VERIFICATION OF THE PETITION (§ 3-1007)

1007.1. Upon the acceptance of an initiative or referendum petition for
   filing, whether in the normal course or at the direction of the court, the
   Board shall certify within thirty (30) calendar days whether the initiative or
   referendum petition contains the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	A sufficient number of valid signatures which meet the qualifying
   percentage and ward distribution requirements; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The necessary number of names and signatures of registered qualified
   electors of the District of Columbia, properly distributed by ward.

   1007.2. In evaluating the sufficiency of the petition, the Board shall first
   verify the registration of each petition signer and determine the number of
   registered voters whose names and apparent signatures appear on the petition,
   and who are registered to vote at the address listed on the petition on the
   date signed.  The Board shall include in this number any petition signer whose
   name appears on the voter registry at a different address, if the Board’s
   records indicate that the voter filed a change of address after the date on
   which the petition was signed.

   1007.3. The number of verified registrants determined pursuant to § 1007.2
   shall establish the universe of apparent registered voter signatures to be
   verified for authenticity by random sample pursuant to § 1008 of this
   chapter.

   1007.4. The Board shall exclude from the random sample universe a signature
   if:
   
   
   
   (a)	The signer’s voter registration was designated &#8220;inactive&#8221; on
   the voter roll pursuant to D.C. Official Code § 1-1001.07(j)(2) (2011 Repl.),
   at the time the petition was signed;
   
   
   
   (b)	The signer, according to the Board’s records, was not registered to vote
   at the address listed on the petition at the time the petition was signed;
   
   
   
   (c)	The signer is not a &#8220;duly registered voter&#8221;;
   
   
   
   (d)	The signature is not dated;
   
   
   
   (e)	The petition does not include the printed or typed current address of the
   signer;
   
   
   
   (f)	The petition does not include the printed or typed name of the signer and,
   in the judgment of the Board, the signature is illegible; or
   
   
   
   (g)	The circulator of the petition sheet did not meet the petition circulator
   requirements set forth in § 1005.1 at the time the petition was signed.

   1007.5. Registered voters who are unable to sign their names may make their
   marks in the space provided for signatures. These marks shall not be counted
   as valid signatures unless the person(s) witnessing the marks has attached an
   affidavit to the petition, wherein it is stated that the contents of the
   petition were explained to the signatory and that the affiant witnessed their
   marks.

   1007.6. If a person has signed an initiative or referendum petition more than
   once, only one (1) signature shall be counted for that person.

   1007.7. If a person who has signed a petition is a duly registered voter on
   the date signed in a ward other than that which was indicated on the petition
   sheet, that person’s signature shall be counted from the proper ward in
   which he or she was duly registered to vote at the time the petition was
   signed.

   1007.8. When some but not all signatures on a petition have been signed
   outside the presence of the circulator, only those signatures signed outside
   the circulator’s presence shall be invalid, and the remaining signatures on
   the sheet shall be deemed valid if there are no other defects in the
   signatures.

   1007.9. For the purposes of this section, a &#8220;duly registered
   voter&#8221; shall be a registered qualified elector who is registered to vote
   at the address listed on the petition as shown on the Board’s voter
   registration records at the time the petition was signed and whose
   registration is not designated &#8220;inactive&#8221; on the voter roll at the
   time the petition is signed.

   1007.10. A registered voter may submit a written notarized request to the
   Board to disallow the voter’s signature from being counted on the petition;
   Provided, that the request shall be received by the Board prior to the time
   the petition is filed.

   1007.11. If the number of apparent signatures determined pursuant to § 1007.2
   does not meet or exceed the established ward and District-wide requirements,
   the Board shall reject the petition.

   1007.12. If the number of apparent signatures of registered voters determined
   pursuant to § 1007.2 meets or exceeds the established minimum ward and
   District-wide requirements, the Board shall verify the apparent voter
   signatures appearing on the initiative or referendum petition by performing a
   bona fide random, statistical sampling pursuant to § 1008 of this chapter
   under the guidance of the Data Management Division of the Office of Planning.
