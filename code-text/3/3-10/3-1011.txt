                                  DC REGULATIONS

POSTING OF INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM PETITIONS (ยง 3-1011)

1011.1. The Board shall post initiative or referendum petitions, or facsimiles
   thereof, in its office for public inspection for ten (10) days, including
   Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, beginning on the third (3rd) day after the
   filing deadline required by law.

   1011.2. Any qualified elector may within the ten (10)-day posting period
   challenge the validity of any petition by filing with the Board a written
   statement that concisely specifies the alleged defect(s) in the petition and
   is duly signed by the challenger.

   1011.3. A qualified elector may also challenge the validity of an initiative
   or referendum petition by citing the exact provision(s) in the Board&#8217;s
   regulations upon which the challenge is based.  For example, if the ground
   upon which a signature is challenged is that the signature is not dated, such
   challenge shall be expressed as follows: &#8220;3 DCMR ยง 1009.10(d)&#8221;.

   1011.4. The Board shall not accept any challenge which, on its face, does not
   allege defects in the petition which, if valid, would render the proposed
   measure ineligible for ballot access.

   1011.5. The Board may, on its own motion, dismiss a petition challenge where
   the total number of challenged signatures would not reduce the total number of
   signatures submitted by the proposer(s) below the required statutory amount.

   1011.6. Within three (3) working days of receipt of a challenge, the Board
   shall serve in person, by certified mail, or email a copy of the challenge
   upon the proposer of the measure.

   1011.7. The Board shall receive evidence in support of and in opposition to
   the challenge and determine the validity of the challenged petition not more
   than twenty (20) days after the challenge has been filed.

   1011.8. Petition challenges shall be adjudicated in accordance with the
   procedures prescribed by Chapter 4 of this title.

   1011.9. In the event a petition challenge is filed with the Board, the
   permanent registration records of the Board shall be searched by members of
   its staff and those staff persons shall be made available as witnesses to
   either party.

   1011.10. The scope of the search shall be limited to matters raised in the
   petition challenge, including, but not limited to, the following:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Whether the signer is a duly registered elector;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Whether the signature is that of the duly registered elector whose name
   appears on the petition; and
   
   
   
   
   
   (c)	 Whether the signer is a resident of the applicable ward.

   1011.11. In the event the Board discovers a fatal defect either on the face of
   a petition or pursuant to a record search concerning a specific allegation or
   challenge, the Board may, on its own motion, declare the signature invalid,
   notwithstanding the defect was not alleged or challenged.

   1011.12. The Board shall consider any other evidence as may be submitted,
   including, but not limited to, documentary evidence, affidavits, and oral
   testimony.

   1011.13. The Board, in view of the fact that it shall hear and determine the
   validity of the challenged petition within a limited time, may limit
   examination and cross- examination of witnesses to the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Objections and specifications of any objections, if any, to the initiative
   or referendum petition; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Objections and specifications of objections, if any, to the petition
   challenge.
   
   
   
   1011. 14	Within three (3) days after announcement of the determination of the
   Board with respect to the validity of a petition, either the challenger or the
   proposer of the measure may apply to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals
   for a review of the reasonableness of such determination. The Court shall
   expedite consideration of the matter and the decision of such Court shall be
   final and not appealable.
