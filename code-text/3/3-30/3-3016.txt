   (b)	Reasonable efforts, including, for example, fundraising, reducing overhead
   costs, and liquidating assets, were undertaken to satisfy the outstanding
   debt; and

   collect debts from a non-political debtor in similar circumstances.

   (c)	The creditor cannot be located after best efforts to do so.
