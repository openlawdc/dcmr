   closing the polls is extended pursuant to a federal or District of Columbia
   court order or Board order.

   704.2. All persons standing in line at a polling place at the close of polls
   shall be permitted to vote, if otherwise qualified.

   of polling place hours and, if applicable, how long polling place hours will
   be extended.
