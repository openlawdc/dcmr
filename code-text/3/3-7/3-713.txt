   (a)	Has registered to vote prior to the date that in-person absentee voting
   begins at the Board’s office; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Registers after the date that in-person absentee voting begins at the

   Party (independent).”

   713.4. On Election Day, each duly registered voter shall cast a regular ballot
   at the polling place serving the residence address of the registered voter,
   provided that a duly registered voter may cast a special ballot at a precinct
   that is not his or her precinct of residence.

   713.5. During the hours of voting, the Board shall place in each early voting
   center and polling place an alphabetical list (poll book) of all persons
   registered in that precinct and eligible to vote in the election.

   include the name, address, party affiliation (where applicable), and ANC
   Single-Member District (where applicable) of each duly registered voter
   residing in the precinct.

   713.8. When a duly registered voter appears to vote, the voter shall state
   aloud his or her name and address.  The designated election official shall
   then locate and verify the voter’s name, address, party affiliation, and ANC
   Single-Member District (where applicable) from the poll book.

   713.9. The voter shall confirm the accuracy of the name, address, party
   affiliation, and ANC Single-Member District where applicable, before signing
   the poll book, or other record prescribed by the Board.  Such signature shall

   the Board’s records.

   duties:
   
   
   
   (a)	Issue a Voter Card to the voter;
   
   
   
   (b)	Require that the voter’s full name be printed on the Voter Card, and if

   (c)	Direct the voter to the appropriate polling place official to obtain a
   ballot.

   primary election, and the name and ANC Single-Member District on the Voter
   Card in a general election;
   
   
   
   (c)	Ascertaining whether the voter will vote using the optical scan voting
   equipment (OSVE) or the direct recording electronic (DRE) voting equipment;
   
   
   
   (d)	Issuing to each voter the ballot(s) to which he or she is entitled; and
   
   
   
   (e)	Depositing the Voter Card in a container provided for that purpose.

   713.12. The voter shall complete his or her ballot and submit such ballot
   according to instructions provided.

   713.13. In the event that the OSVE becomes inoperable for any reason during
   the election process, voters shall place voted ballots into the auxiliary
   ballot box. All ballots deposited in this auxiliary box shall be tabulated
   after the polls close, either at the polling place if the machine regains
   operability or at a counting place.

   713.14. In the event that the DRE voting equipment becomes inoperable for any
   reason during the election process, voters shall be directed to use the OSVE. 
   The Board shall make reasonable accommodations to voters, who by reason of
   disability or preference, wish to vote using the DRE equipment.

   713.15. Any repairs conducted on either the OSVE or DRE equipment will be
   performed in the presence and view of:
