PROHIBITION OF LABELS, STICKERS, AND AUTHORIZATION OF HAND STAMPS FOR CASTING
WRITE-IN VOTES ON PAPER BALLOTS (ยง 3-722)

722.1. The use of stickers and adhesive labels as a way of exercising the
   write-in method of voting is prohibited. Any write-in vote cast in this manner
   shall be deemed invalid.

   722.2. The use of a stamp by a voter to imprint the name of a write-in
   candidate in the appropriate space on the voter&#8217;s ballot shall be
   permitted under the following circumstances:
   
   
   
   (a)	Where the stamp serves only to print the name of the write-in candidate on
   the voter&#8217;s paper ballot; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Where the stamp does not affix any adhesive or other foreign material on
   the voter&#8217;s ballot.

   722.3. Any voter may bring into a polling place or early voting center in any
   election where paper ballots are being cast a stamp for the purpose of
   exercising the write-in vote option, consistent with ยง 722.2, for the
   voter&#8217;s personal use, provided that the voter must carry the stamp out
   of the polling place or early voting center with him once he or she has voted.
   Any stamps left in the polling place or early voting center shall be discarded
   by election workers.

   722.4. Any candidate, campaign organization, or individual may provide or
   distribute a stamp to voters for their use in exercising their write-in option
   in any election by any means including the distribution of a stamp outside of
   a polling place or early voting center where paper ballots are being cast,
   provided that the distribution shall occur outside the fifty foot (50ft.)
   line, within which no political activity is permitted.

   722.5. No one may distribute any stamp device to any voter or any other person
   within the fifty foot (50 ft.) line from an early voting center or polling
   place entrance or inside any early voting center or polling place.
