   (a)	Simplification of the issues;
   
   
   
   (b)	The necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings;
   
   
   
   (c)	The possibility of obtaining the admission of facts and documents which
   will avoid unnecessary proof;
   
   
   
   (d)	Limitation of the number of witnesses; and

   415.2. The Board may enter an order which recites the action taken at the
   conference, the amendments allowed to the pleadings, and the agreements made
   by the parties as to any of the matters considered which limit the issues for
   hearing, to those issues not disposed of by admissions or agreements of
   counsel or parties. The order, when entered, shall control the subsequent
   course of the action.
