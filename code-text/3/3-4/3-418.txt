   who has received notice has not appeared, the Chairperson may proceed as
   follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	The Chairman may adjourn the case without taking testimony; provided, that
   there is no inconvenience to the party who appeared and no objection to an
   adjournment; or
   
   
   
   (b)	If the default appears deliberate, the Chairperson may proceed with the
   hearing, obtain the testimony of those persons present, and, on the basis of
   the testimony and the record, issue a decision in the case.
