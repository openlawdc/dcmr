PARTICIPANT CARE PLAN (ยง 29-715)

   therapies. It shall list what is needed, how it will be provided, by whom, and
   during what time frame.

   715.3. All services shall be provided in accordance with what is specified in
   the plan. The plan shall be developed with an interdisciplinary approach.

   frequently if necessary) and shall record any changes in the
   participant&#8217;s treatment or condition.

   715.5. The plan shall indicate, in writing, any other supportive services that
   the participant is receiving away from the day treatment program such as
   homemaker services, other therapies, and other services.
