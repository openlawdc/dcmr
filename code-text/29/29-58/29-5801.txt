                                  DC REGULATIONS

LIVING ARRANGEMENTS FOR PREGNANT OR PARENTING MINORS (ยง 29-5801)

5801.1. If a pregnant or parenting minor who is applying for or receiving TANF
   benefits claims an exemption to the requirement to live in an adult-supervised
   setting, DHS shall refer the pregnant or parenting minor&#8217;s claim to the
   Family Services Administration (FSA) to investigate the claim.

   5801.2. If the pregnant or parenting minor is receiving TANF benefits at the
   time the pregnant or parenting minor claims an exemption, TANF benefits shall
   continue to be paid during the investigation.

   5801.3. If the pregnant or parenting minor claims an exemption while still an
   applicant for TANF assistance, consideration of the pregnant or parenting
   minor&#8217;s application shall proceed during the investigation.

   5801.4. If forty-five (45) days have elapsed since the date the pregnant or
   parenting minor made the application, and the pregnant or parenting minor is
   determined otherwise eligible for TANF, but the investigation is not yet
   complete, the pregnant or parenting minor&#8217;s application shall be
   approved.

   5801.5. If the investigation demonstrates, after the pregnant or parenting
   minor&#8217;s application has been approved, that the claim of an exemption is
   not founded, the pregnant or parenting minor shall be excluded from the TANF
   benefit, after adequate and timely notice has been given, until the pregnant
   or parenting minor moves to a living arrangement that is determined
   appropriate by DHS. In determining whether a living arrangement is
   appropriate, DHS shall consider the best interests of the pregnant or
   parenting minor and the pregnant or parenting minor&#8217;s dependent child.

   5801.6. In addition to the provisions established in Sections 563(b)(1)
   through (4) of the District of Columbia Public Assistance Act of 1982, as
   amended, effective October 17, 1995 (D.C. Law 11-72; D.C. Official Code
   4-205.63), a pregnant or parenting minor and the minor&#8217;s dependent child
   shall be determined to have good cause to receive TANF benefits while living
   apart from the pregnant or parenting minor&#8217;s parent, legal guardian, or
   other adult relative if FSA determines that it would be in the best interests
   of the pregnant or parenting minor&#8217;s child to do so, based on factors
   including, but not limited to, the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The pregnant or parenting minor&#8217;s maturity;
   
   
   
   (b)	The period of time that the pregnant or parenting minor has lived
   independently;
   
   
   
   (c)	The pregnant or parenting minor&#8217;s access to supportive services; and
   
   
   
   (d)	The pregnant or parenting minor&#8217;s demonstration of the acquisition
   of independent living and parenting skills.

   5801.7. The fact that a pregnant or parenting minor has been living
   independently for any period of time does not, by itself, excuse the pregnant
   or parenting minor from the requirement to live in an adult-supervised
   setting.

   5801.8. A pregnant or parenting minor who applies for or receives TANF
   benefits, and who does not have an exemption from the requirement to live in
   an adult-supervised setting, shall present the following proof that a living
   situation is allowable:
   
   
   
   (a)	A birth certificate, other document, or statements from collateral
   contacts that establishes the familial or custodial relationship, with an
   adult in whose home the pregnant or parenting minor is living; and
   
   
   
   (b)	A statement from the adult with whom the pregnant or parenting minor lives
   and from a third party, asserting that the pregnant or parenting minor lives
   with the adult.

   5801.9. A pregnant or parenting minor applying for TANF benefits shall present
   the proof of an allowable living situation no later than forty-five (45) days
   from the date of application.

   5801.10. A pregnant or parenting minor who is receiving TANF benefits may be
   required to present, no later than forty-five (45) days before the expiration
   of each certification period, proof of an allowable living situation. Failure
   to present the required proof shall result in excluding the pregnant or
   parenting minor&#8217;s needs from the TANF benefit, after adequate and timely
   notice has been given.

   5801.11. A pregnant or parenting minor who applies for or is receiving TANF
   benefits and who is not living in the home of the pregnant or parenting
   minor&#8217;s parent, guardian, or adult relative may be referred to FSA for
   assessment and development of a personal responsibility plan for independence.

   5801.12. DHS shall give each pregnant or parenting minor who applies for TANF
   benefits notice of the pregnant or parenting minor&#8217;s eligibility
   requirements, rights and obligations, and the opportunity to speak with DHS
   outside of the presence of the pregnant or parenting minor&#8217;s parent or
   legal guardian, established under the District of Columbia Public Assistance
   Act of 1982, as amended.

   5801.13. At the time of application, DHS shall request the pregnant or
   parenting minor to sign a copy of a written notice, entitled
   &#8220;Acknowledgment of TANF Program Rules,&#8221; which references the
   special requirements for pregnant or parenting minors. The pregnant or
   parenting minor&#8217;s signature shall indicate that the pregnant or
   parenting minor received and understood the notice.

   5801.14. In determining the appropriate living arrangement for a pregnant or
   parenting minor, DHS shall consider the best interests of the pregnant or
   parenting minor and the pregnant or parenting minor&#8217;s dependent child.

   5801.15. DHS shall select second chance homes (as defined by the
   Self-Sufficiency Promotion Amendment Act of 1998, effective April 20, 1999
   (D.C. Law 12-241; D.C. Official Code Section 4-201 et seq.)), maternity homes,
   or other appropriate adult-supervised supportive living arrangements based on
   criteria that include, but are not limited to, the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The presence of a responsible adult in the home who can supervise the
   pregnant or parenting minor; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The availability of an adult to provide or oversee training and
   instruction in parenting skills, child development, budgeting and other
   independent living skills.

   5801.16. For purposes of this section an &#8220;allowable living
   situation&#8221; or &#8220;appropriate living situation&#8221; is one in which
   a pregnant or parenting minor lives with the pregnant or parenting
   minor&#8217;s parent, guardian, or other adult relative, or lives in a second
   chance home, maternity home, other appropriate adult-supervised supportive
   living arrangement, or other setting that DHS determines is in the best
   interest of the pregnant or parenting minor and the pregnant or parenting
   minor&#8217;s child.

   5801.17. A pregnant or parenting minor may appeal the decision on appropriate
   living arrangement through the fair hearing process.
