                                  DC REGULATIONS

SANCTIONS (§ 29-5812)

5812.1. A non-exempt TANF customer (Customer) is required to comply with his
   or her negotiated TANF Individual Responsibility Plan (IRP) as approved by the
   Director or his or her designee, or meet his or her work requirements, as set
   forth in D.C. Official Code §§ 4-205.19b and  4-205.19d (2008 Repl. &#038;
   2012 Supp.). DHS shall impose the appropriate graduated sanction on Customers
   who fail to meet this requirement for at least four (4) consecutive weeks,
   without good cause.

   5812.2. TANF customers are assigned to a TANF Service Provider (Provider) with
   whom the Customer communicates with in regards to his or her efforts to work
   on and achieve the goals set out in their approved IRP.  Providers shall
   report monthly to DHS each Customer’s level of participation in working on
   their IRP.  Providers shall report to DHS whether the Customer is:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Fully participating;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Partially participating and making efforts to improve their participation;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Participating at consistently low levels of participation and not working to
   improve their participation; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Completely non-participating.

   5812.3. “Non-compliance” for purposes of § 5812.1 is defined as either
   participating at a consistently low level of participation and not working to
   improve his or her participation for at least eight (8) consecutive weeks or
   completely non-participating for at least four (4) consecutive weeks, as
   determined by the Department following the review required by § 5812.5.

   5812.4. For any Customer who is at risk of non-compliance as defined in §
   5812.3, the Provider shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	Reach out and make efforts to engage and support the Customer in becoming
   compliant by making at least three (3) attempts through at least two (2)
   different methods to contact the Customer at his or her last known address or
   phone number; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Document the steps that the Provider took to help the Customer meet the
   requirements of § 5812.1.

   5812.5. When a Provider notifies DHS that a Customer has consistently low
   levels of participation and is not working to improve his or her participation
   for at least eight (8) weeks or is completely non-participating for at least
   four (4) weeks, DHS shall conduct a review of all relevant information to
   determine whether there exists any known basis for an exemption or good cause
   reason for non-compliance.  Information to be reviewed shall include the
   Provider’s outreach and engagement efforts, DHS records, and other relevant
   records and information available to DHS.

   5812.6. If upon completion of the DHS review required by § 5812.5, DHS
   determines that a Customer is non-compliant as defined by § 5812.3 and at
   risk of a sanction, DHS shall send a written notice to the Customer&#8217;s
   last known address.  The notice shall state:
   
   
   
   (a)	That the Customer is non-compliant with the requirements of § 5812.1 and
   is at risk of a sanction;
   
   
   
   (b)	The basis for non-compliance, including the specific dates and facts
   surrounding the Customer’s non-compliance;
   
   
   
   (c)   	The level of sanction that will be imposed, the date the sanction will
   be imposed, and the consequences of the sanction;
   
   
   
   (d)	That the Customer can avoid the sanction by:
   
   
   
   (1)	Re-engaging in accordance with their IRP by participating in the
   activities and meeting the requirements of the IRP for four (4) consecutive
   weeks prior to the effective date of the sanction;
   
   
   
   (2)	Re-negotiating their IRP one (1) time before the sanction becomes
   effective, provided the renegotiated plan addresses a factor that prevented
   the Customer from meeting the requirements of § 5812.1; or
   
   
   
   (3)	Demonstrating that the Customer is in compliance because he or she:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   	Met the requirements of § 5812.1 for at least one (1) calendar month prior
   to the effective date of a proposed sanction;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   	Provided documentation of a good cause reason for non-compliance due to
   absence, in accordance with 29 DCMR § 5810.3, to his or her Provider or the
   DHS Office of Work Opportunity, TANF Connections Unit, within ten (10)
   business days of the absence;
   
   
   
   (C)	Provided documentation of an exemption, in accordance with 29 DCMR §
   5809, to his or her Provider or the DHS Office of Work Opportunity, TANF
   Connections Unit, within ten (10) business days of the absence; or
   
   
   
   (D)	Provided documentation that the Customer met the requirements of § 5812.1
   during the period of non-compliance to his or her Provider or the DHS Office
   of Work Opportunity, TANF Connections Unit within thirty (30) calendar days
   after the day the work activity was completed, with the exception of pay
   stubs, which shall be accepted within thirty (30) days of payment;
   
   
   
   (e)  	That the Provider is available to help the Customer meet the
   requirements of § 5812.1; and
   
   
   
   (f)	The name, address, phone, and fax number of the Provider and person to
   contact for questions.

   5812.7. When a Customer fails to come into compliance with the requirements of
   § 5812.1, despite Provider outreach and engagement efforts required by §
   5812.4 and the DHS notice to him or her as required by § 5812.6, DHS shall
   provide advance written notice to the Customer that a sanction shall be
   imposed. This notice shall be provided in accordance with D.C. Official Code
   § 4-205.55 (2008 Repl.).

   5812.8. When a Customer fails to meet the requirements of § 5812.1, DHS shall
   impose a graduated system of sanctions, which consist of the following three
   (3) levels:
   
   
   
   (a) 	Level One: an individual sanction is applied when a Customer fails to
   meet the requirements of § 5812.1;
   
   
   
   (b)  	Level Two: a fifty percent (50%) reduction in the assistance unit’s
   TANF benefits as determined in accordance with D.C. Official Code § 4-205.52
   (2012 Supp.), is applied when a Customer fails to meet the requirements of §
   5812.1 a second time; and
   
   
   
   (c) 	Level Three: a one (1) month full family sanction is applied when a
   Customer fails to meet the requirements of § 5812.1 a third time.  To receive
   TANF benefits following a one (1) month full family sanction, a Customer must
   complete an updated assessment and re-negotiate their IRP.

   5812.9. Before a Customer is subject to any level of sanction set forth in §
   5812.8, the requirements of § 5812.4, 5812.5, 5812.6 and 5812.7 must be
   completed.

   5812.10. Any Customer who, after completing at least six (6) months compliance
   with their IRP following any level of sanction, fails to comply with § 5812.1
   an additional time, shall initially be subject to the Level One sanction, as
   if they had not previously been sanctioned.

   5812.11. A Customer subject to sanction shall have the right to appeal a
   sanction through an administrative review and a fair hearing, pursuant to D.C.
   Official Code §§ 4-210.01, et seq. (2008 Repl.).  The Customer has the right
   to appeal the sanction on the following grounds:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   	The Customer timely submitted hard copy documentation to his or her Provider
   or DHS that supports:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   	A good cause reason for non-compliance in accordance with § 5810.3;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   	An exemption from work participation requirements in accordance with § 5809;
   or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   	Compliance with the requirements of § 5812.1 during the period of
   non-compliance; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   	The Customer’s Provider or DHS did not act on or approve documentation
   provided;
   
   
   
   (b) 	The Customer has a good cause reason for failing to provide such
   documentation; or
   
   
   
   (c) 	The Provider or DHS failed to meet the due process requirements under
   this section.
   
   
   
   5812.12 	The Level One, Level Two, or Level Three sanctions shall be lifted
   when the Customer complies with the requirements of § 5812.1 for at least
   four (4) consecutive weeks.

   5812.13. A Customer who is sanctioned under the DHS TANF sanction policy in
   effect prior to the promulgation of these rules shall receive adequate notice
   that he or she shall be scheduled to complete an orientation and assessment,
   and shall be required to negotiate an IRP.  A Customer who fails to complete
   an orientation and assessment and fails to negotiate an IRP within sixty (60)
   days of the date of the notice, shall be subject to a Level Two sanction.
