                                  DC REGULATIONS

INCOME DISREGARDS (ยง 29-5814)

5814.1. In determining the eligibility of a TANF applicant or recipient, the
   term &#8220;earned income&#8221; means:
   
   
   
   (a)	Income in cash or in kind earned by an individual through the receipt of
   wages, salary, commissions, or profit from activities in which he or she is
   engaged as a self-employed individual or as an employee;
   
   
   
   (b)	Gross earned income prior to any deductions for taxes or for any other
   purposes, which may be derived from one&#8217;s own employment such as a
   business enterprise or farming, or derived from wages or salary received as an
   employee; and includes earnings over a period of time for which settlement is
   made at one given time, as in the instance of sale of farm crops, livestock,
   or poultry;
   
   
   
   (c)	With reference to commissions, wages, or salary, the total amount,
   irrespective of personal expenses, such as income-tax deductions, lunches, and
   transportation to and from work, and irrespective of expenses of employment
   which are not personal, such as the cost of tools, materials, special
   uniforms, or transportation to call on customers;
   
   
   
   (d)	With respect to self-employment, the total profit from business
   enterprise, farming, etc. resulting from a comparison of the gross receipts
   with the business expenses, i.e., expenses directly related to producing the
   goods or services and without which the goods or services could not be
   produced. Items such as depreciation, personal business and entertainment
   expenses, personal transportation, purchase of capital equipment and payments
   on the principal of loans for capital assets or durable goods are not business
   expenses; and
   
   
   
   (e)	With regard to the degree of activity, income produced as a result of the
   performance of services by a recipient; income which the individual earns by
   his or her own efforts, including managerial responsibilities, would be
   properly classified as earned income, such as management of capital investment
   in real estate. For example, in the instance of capital investment wherein the
   individual carries no specific responsibility, such as where rental properties
   are in the hands of rental agencies and the check is forwarded to the
   recipient, the income would not be classified as earned income.

   5814.2. The following sources of income shall be excluded from the calculation
   of earned income:
   
   
   
   	(a)	Returns from capital investment with respect to which the 	individual is
   not himself or herself actively engaged, as in a 	business (for example, under
   most circumstances, dividends and 	interest would be excluded from earned
   income);
   
   
   
   	(b)	Benefits (not in the nature of wages, salary, or profit) accruing 	as
   compensation, or reward for service, or as compensation for 	lack of
   employment (for example, pensions and benefits, such 	as United Mine
   Workers&#8217; benefits or veterans&#8217; benefits);
   
   
   
   	(c)		The work participation allowance pursuant to subsection 5813; 			and
   
   
   
   	(d)		Returns from the earned income tax credit or any other 				refundable
   tax.
   
   
   
   	(e)		Compensation received from jury or grand jury duty.

   5814.3. For purposes of this chapter, the term &#8220;unearned income&#8221;
   shall mean, but is not limited to:
   
   
   
   	(a)	Assistance payments from federal or federally-aided public 	assistance
   programs such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) 	or Temporary Assistance
   to Needy Families (TANF); or other 	assistance programs based on need.
   Assistance payments from 	programs which require, as a condition of
   eligibility, the actual 	performance of work without compensation other than
   the 	assistance payments themselves, shall be considered unearned 	income;
   
   
   
   	(b)		Annuities; pensions; retirement; veteran&#8217;s or disability benefits;
   			worker&#8217;s or unemployment compensation; old-age, survivors or
   			social security benefits; strike benefits; and foster care payment 		for
   children or adults;
   
   
   
   	(c)		Scholarships, educational grants, fellowships, deferred payment 		loans
   for education, veteran&#8217;s education benefits and the like, 			excluding
   amounts for tuition, books, and mandatory fees;
   
   
   
   		(d)		Payments from Government-sponsored programs, dividends, 			interest,
   royalties, and all other direct money payments from 			any source which can be
   construed to be a gain or benefit; 				and
   
   
   
   		(e)		Monies which are withdrawn or dividends which are or 				could be
   received by the household from trust funds in the 				month received by the
   household.

   5814.4. For purposes of an eligibility determination, the District of Columbia
   shall disregard from the monthly earned income applicable to TANF, earned
   income of each individual whose needs are included in the eligibility
   determination, where appropriate, as follows:
   
   
   
   	(a)		The monthly earned income of each child receiving TANF if the 		child is
   a full-time student or is a part-time student who is not a 			full-time
   employee; and
   
   
   
   	(b)		The first one hundred and sixty dollars ($ 160.00) as a 				work-related
   expense.

   5814.5. After application of these disregards in subsection 5814.4, the
   remaining income shall be compared to the Standard of Assistance for a family
   unit.  The Standard of Assistance shall be defined as specified in the
   District of Columbia Public Assistance Act of 1982, as amended.  If less than
   the Standard of Assistance, the income shall be compared to the payment
   standard.  The payment standard shall be defined as specified in the District
   of Columbia Public Assistance Act of 1982, as amended.  The payment levels set
   forth in Chapter 27 of Title 29 DCMR shall apply to payments made as of
   February 1, 2011.

   5814.6. An applicant shall be eligible for TANF if the unearned income, plus
   earned income, less specified disregards, is less than the payment standard
   for the applicable family size.

   5814.7. For purposes of benefit calculation for individuals found eligible and
   for ongoing eligibility, the following disregards shall be applied, where
   appropriate:
   
   
   
   	(a)	The monthly earned income of each child receiving TANF if the 	child is a
   full-time student or is a part-time student who is not a 	full-time employee;
   
   
   
   		(b)		The first one hundred and sixty dollars ($ 160.00) as a
   				work-related expense;
   
   
   
   		(c)		Two-thirds (2/3) of the earned remaining income after the
   				application of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection; and
   
   
   
   		(d)		The remaining income is countable and shall be less than the 			payment
   standard for the applicable family size in order for 			the assistance unit to
   retain TANF eligibility.

   5814.8. The earned income disregard of two-thirds (2/3) as specified in
   subsection 5814.7(c) shall not apply to the earned income of an individual
   until the month following the month of the report in which one (1) of the
   following conditions apply to him or her:
   
   
   
   (a)	The individual terminated employment without good cause within the period
   of sixty (60) days preceding the month in which a report is due, as specified
   in subsections 5814.11 and 5814.12; or
   
   
   
   (b)	The individual refused without good cause to accept a bonafide offer of
   employment within the period of sixty (60) days preceding the month in which a
   report is due, as specified in subsections 5814.11 and 5814.12; or
   
   
   
   (c)	The individual without good cause failed to report earned income, as
   specified in Section 2 (rr) of the Self-Sufficiency Promotion Amendment Act of
   1998, effective April 20, 1999 (D.C. Law 12-241; D.C. Official Code Section
   4-205.54).

   5814.9. If the loss of the earned income disregard of two-thirds (2/3) results
   in the group being over-income for receipt of TANF benefits, TANF eligibility
   shall be terminated after adequate and timely notice is provided. The group
   could reapply for TANF benefits at any time, but the group would be treated as
   an applicant group in determining its countable income.

   5814.10. The Director or his or her designee shall be responsible for
   determining whether or not good cause under subsection 5814.8 exists by
   considering the facts and the circumstances, including information submitted
   by the individual and the employer.

   5814.11. Good cause under subsection 5814.8 shall include circumstances beyond
   the individual&#8217;s control such as, but not limited to, the reasons listed
   in subsection 5810.3.

   5814.12. Each TANF recipient who also receives Food Stamps shall report their
   income, and any other changes in circumstances, on a semiannual basis. This
   reporting requirement may be in person or by mail at the discretion of the
   Mayor.

   5814.13. The semiannual reports required by subsection 5814.12, shall be due
   during the sixth month of the eligibility period.

   5814.14. If a TANF recipient fails without good cause to complete the
   semiannual report as required by subsection 5814.12, TANF eligibility shall be
   terminated after adequate and timely notice is provided. The group could
   reapply for TANF benefits at any time, but the group would be treated as an
   applicant group when determining its countable income.

   5814.15. The information contained in a semiannual report shall be used to
   determine eligibility in the month after the report was due. This information
   is the basis for determining eligibility for the month after the report was
   due and the following five (5) months.

   5814.16. A recipient shall have the opportunity to report a significant change
   in income before his or her next periodic report is due. An interim report of
   such changes received by DHS at least ten (10) days before the end of the
   month shall be considered timely in determining the next month&#8217;s
   benefits.

   5814.17. Denial of the earned income disregard of two-thirds (2/3) shall be an
   adverse action requiring adequate notice and may be appealed through the fair
   hearing process.
