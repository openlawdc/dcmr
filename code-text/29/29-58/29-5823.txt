WORK PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENT AND CHILD SUPPORT COOPERATION WAIVER
DETERMINATION (ยง 29-5823)

5823.1. Waivers of the work participation requirements shall be granted when
   the requirements would make it more difficult for the applicant or recipient
   to escape family violence, place the applicant or recipient at further risk of
   violence, or where failure to comply with work requirements is a result of
   family violence.

   5823.2. Waivers of the child support cooperation requirements are governed by
   Title 29, Chapter 17 of these rules.

   5823.3. The Director or his or her designee shall grant or deny a domestic
   violence good cause waiver within fifteen (15) business days.

   5823.4. If an applicant or recipient is otherwise eligible, TANF financial
   assistance shall not be delayed or denied while a domestic violence good cause
   waiver request is pending.

   5823.5. Because a waiver of work participation requirements may be necessary
   to ensure the safety of an applicant or recipient or her family, an applicant
   or recipient shall not be required to participate in work programs pending a
   decision on whether to grant a waiver.
