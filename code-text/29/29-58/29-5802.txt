MINORS ABSENT FROM THE HOME (ยง 29-5802)

5802.1. A minor who is absent from the home for more than ninety (90) days or
   who is expected by the minor&#8217;s parent or other caretaker relative to be
   absent from the home for more than ninety (90) days shall be ineligible to
   receive TANF benefits unless the absence is due to good cause.

   5802.2. For purposes of this section, &#8220;good cause&#8221; shall be
   defined as:
   
   
   
   (a)	Participation in a training program, including the Job Corps;
   
   
   
   (b)	Attendance at a residential school, including schools that also provide
   medical care, if the parent or caretaker relative still must maintain a home
   for the minor during periods of non-residence at the home;
   
   
   
   (c)	Participation in treatment in a residential center for drug or alcohol
   abuse or addiction;
   
   
   
   (d)	Hospitalization, including situations in which newborns remain in the
   hospital after the mother is discharged, unless:
   
   
   
   (1)	Written statements or other evidence by a competent medical authority
   indicate that it is unlikely that the newborn will ever be released to the
   parent&#8217;s home;
   
   
   
   (2)	The newborn is made a ward of the District; or
   
   
   
   (3)	A person other than the parent obtains legal custody of the newborn; or
   
   
   
   (e)	Brief visits away from home, including joint or shared custody or
   visitation arrangements, which requires the minor to be absent from the home
   for more than ninety (90) consecutive days but less than one hundred (100)
   days, with the expectation that the applicant or recipient of TANF still
   maintain a home for the minor. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to
   permit a minor to be included at any time in more than one (1) cash assistance
   unit simultaneously.

   5802.3. A parent or caretaker relative shall inform the Department of the
   minor&#8217;s absence no more than five (5) days from the date it becomes
   clear to the parent or caretaker relative that the minor will be absent from
   the home without good cause for more than ninety (90) days.

   5802.4. If a parent or caretaker relative fails to report that a minor is
   absent from the home for more than ninety (90) days, or fails to report that a
   minor is expected to be absent from the home for more than ninety (90) days
   (when such expectation is found to be correct), the needs of the parent or
   caretaker relative shall be excluded from the TANF benefit for a period of
   three (3) months, after adequate and timely notice has been given.

   5802.5. If a parent or caretaker makes a late report of a minor&#8217;s
   absence or expected absence from the home for more than ninety (90) days, as
   described above, the needs of the parent or caretaker relative shall be
   excluded from the TANF benefit for one (1) month, beginning with the month
   following the absence of the child from the home.

   5802.6. DHS shall not deny TANF benefits to a minor who is expected to be
   absent from the home for more than ninety (90) days but who, in fact, is not
   absent for more than ninety (90) days.

   5802.7. DHS shall inform each TANF applicant or recipient orally and in
   writing of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The applicant&#8217;s or recipient&#8217;s responsibility to report any
   minor&#8217;s absence from the home, if the absence is expected to exceed
   ninety (90) days;
   
   
   
   (b)	The consequences of a minor&#8217;s absence from the home for more than
   ninety (90) days;
   
   
   
   (c)	The consequences of a parent&#8217;s or caretaker&#8217;s failure to make
   a timely report of a minor&#8217;s absence or expected absence for more than
   ninety (90) days; and
   
   
   
   (d)	The effect of a late report of a minor&#8217;s absence, or expected
   absence for more than ninety (90) days.

   5802.8. A parent or caretaker relative may appeal a sanction for not complying
   with a notification regarding a minor absent from the home through the fair
   hearing process.
