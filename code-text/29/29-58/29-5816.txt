                                  DC REGULATIONS

COLLECTION OF OVERPAYMENTS (ยง 29-5816)

5816.1. For purposes of this chapter, an &#8220;overpayment&#8221; shall mean
   a TANF payment received for the payment month which exceeds the amount for
   which that unit was eligible.

   5816.2. The District shall recover an overpayment of TANF by seeking
   reimbursement from:
   
   
   
   (a)	The assistance unit which was overpaid;
   
   
   
   (b)	The assistance unit of which an adult member of the overpaid assistance
   unit has subsequently become a member; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Any individual adult members of the overpaid assistance unit whether or
   not currently a recipient.

   5816.3. If the District seeks to recover overpayments from an individual who
   is no longer a recipient, or from a recipient who refuses to repay the
   overpayment from his or her income and resources, recovery shall be made by
   appropriate action, pursuant to District law, against the income or resources
   of the individual.

   5816.4. Under the District of Columbia Public Assistance Act of 1982, as
   amended, if through recovery the amount payable to the assistance unit is
   reduced to ten dollars ($ 10.00) or less, members of the assistance unit shall
   be considered recipients of TANF.

   5816.5. In cases where both an underpayment and an overpayment have been
   issued, the District may offset the underpayment against the overpayment in
   correcting the payment.

   5816.6. When the District has discovered an overpayment, it shall take one (1)
   of the following actions:
   
   
   
   (a)	Recover the overpayment;
   
   
   
   (b)	Initiate action to locate or recover the overpayment from a former
   recipient; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Recoup from a current recipient&#8217;s grant or income/resources an
   amount sufficient to recover the payment, but not more than ten percent (10%)
   of the monthly benefit payment.

   5816.7. The District or its designee may elect not to attempt recovery of an
   overpayment from an individual no longer receiving TANF aid where the
   overpayment amount is less than one hundred dollars ($ 100.00).

   5816.8. Where the overpayment amount owed by an individual no longer receiving
   aid is one hundred dollars ($ 100.00) or more, the District may determine when
   it is no longer cost-effective to continue overpayment recovery efforts,
   provided it has made reasonable efforts to recover the overpayment from the
   individual. Reasonable efforts include notification of the amount of and
   reason for the overpayment and that repayment is required.
