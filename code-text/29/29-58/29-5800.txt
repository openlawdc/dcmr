SCHOOL ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR PREGNANT OR PARENTING TEENS (ยง 29-5800)

5800.1. Pregnant or parenting TANF recipients under the age of twenty (20) who
   have not completed high school shall attend high school or an approved
   alternate education or training program. This requirement is called the
   &#8220;school attendance requirement&#8221;.

   5800.2. School attendance or participation in an alternative education or
   training program shall be verified. Verification may consist of:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   (a)	DCPS or alternative education or training program attendance records;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   (b)	Statements by collateral contacts; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   (c)	Verification of school registration, if the teen is a recent registrant
   and attendance records are not available.

   5800.3. If a teen fails without good cause as described in subsection 5800.4
   to comply with the school attendance requirement, the teen&#8217;s needs shall
   be excluded from the TANF benefit after adequate and timely notice has been
   provided. The teen&#8217;s needs shall be excluded until he or she complies
   with school attendance requirements. After the teen has complied with school
   attendance requirements, he or she shall become eligible for assistance in the
   next available payment month but shall remain ineligible for the month in
   which compliance began.

   5800.4. The Department may not sanction a pregnant or parenting teen for
   failing to comply with the school attendance requirement if the teen has good
   cause. The following constitute good cause reasons for failing to comply with
   school attendance requirements:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   (a)	The absence is deemed &#8220;excused&#8221; by the educational or training
   institution or program;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   (b)	The teen parent has a child under the age of six (6) years and no private,
   District-funded, or other publicly-funded child care resources are available
   to the teen that are determined by the Department of Human Services (DHS) to
   be suitable, affordable, and within a reasonable distance from the
   teen&#8217;s home or school;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   (c)	The teen&#8217;s child has special health care needs that prevent the
   teen&#8217;s regular attendance at school, which shall be verified by
   competent medical evidence, as determined by the Director of DHS or his or her
   designee;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   (d)	The teen&#8217;s child is less than twelve (12) weeks of age; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   (e)	An extraordinary and unforseen circumstance determined by the Department
   to be beyond the control of the teen and prevent him or her from participating
   in the required activities.

   5800.5. DHS may refer a pregnant or parenting teen in need of supportive
   services to the D.C. Public Schools for services.

   5800.6. A teen shall have the right to appeal a finding of non-attendance
