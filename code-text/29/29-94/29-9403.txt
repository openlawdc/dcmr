9403.1. Pursuant to 42 C.F.R. § 455.450, DHCF shall evaluate all Applications
   according to the level of categorical risk to which the provider or supplier
   type is assigned.

   9403.2. An Applicant shall be classified according to the following risk
   categories:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   High (subject to the screening requirements described in § 9404);
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Moderate (subject to the screening requirements described in § 9405); or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Limited (subject to the screening requirements described in § 9406).

   9403.3. An Applicant that may reasonably fit within more than one (1) risk
   category shall be screened according to the highest level of screening that
   applies to that provider or supplier type.

   9403.4. DHCF shall adjust the categorical risk level from “Limited Risk”
   or “Moderate Risk” to “High Risk” under the following circumstances:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The Applicant has been excluded by the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”)
   of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services within the previous ten
   (10) year period;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The Applicant has been excluded from another state’s Medicaid program within
   the previous ten (10) year period;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   DHCF or CMS lifted a temporary moratorium during the previous six (6) months
   for the specific provider or supplier type that an Applicant is applying
   under, and the Applicant applies within six (6) months from the date the
   moratorium was lifted;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Medicare elevates the risk category for a particular provider type;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   DHCF imposes a payment suspension against a provider due to a credible
   allegation of fraud, waste, or abuse; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The provider has an existing Medicaid overpayment.

   9403.5. Providers or suppliers who are classified as “Moderate Risk” or
   “High Risk” shall be required to attend an orientation session before
   signing the Medicaid Provider Agreement.

   9403.6. DHCF shall reserve the right to modify screening requirements for any
   provider or supplier if DHCF determines Medicare or another state has
   successfully conducted a comparable screening on the same provider or supplier
   and that screening led to enrollment into Medicare or another Medicaid
   program.
