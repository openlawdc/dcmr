                                  DC REGULATIONS

PAYMENT NOTIFICATION (§ 29-2907)

2907.1. As part of the investigation under § 5 of the Act (D.C. Code, 2001
   Ed. § 7-1904), the Department shall determine whether the adult in need of
   protective services is indigent. If the adult is indigent, the Department
   shall not notify the adult that payment is required.

   2907.2. If the person is not indigent and is not in immediate risk of serious
   or life threatening harm, the Department shall, pursuant to § 6(a)(1)(D) of
   the Act (D.C. Code, 2001 Ed. § 7-1905(a)(1)(D)), advise the adult or, if the
   adult is incompetent, a person authorized by law or court order to consent to
   the provision of protective services on behalf of the adult, of any
   contribution or reimbursement required for particular protective services.

   2907.3. If reimbursement or contribution is required for protective services
   under this chapter and the adult or, if the adult is incompetent, a person
   authorized by law or court order to consent to the provision of protective
   services on behalf of the adult, does not agree to pay those costs, the
   Department shall first consider whether the refusal is made without fear or
   intimidation, as provided in § 6(b) of the Act (D.C. Code, 2001 Ed. §
   7-1905(b)).

   2907.4. If a refusal to pay manifestly appears to be prompted by fear or
   intimidation as provided in § 6(b) of the Act (D.C. Code, 2001 Ed. §
   7-1905(b)), the Department shall determine whether there exists an alternative
   service mutually agreeable to the Department and the adult or, if the adult is
   incompetent, a person authorized by law or court order to consent to the
   provision of protective services on behalf of the adult.

   2907.5. If there is no mutually agreeable alternative service, and the
   Department finds that the particular protective services are required, the
   Department shall refer the matter to the Corporation Counsel in order to seek
   a protective order as set forth under§ 7 or 8 of the Act (D.C. Code, 2001 Ed.
   § 7-1906 or 7-1907).

   2907.6. If the initial investigation reveals the existence of immediate,
   substantial risk of life-threatening harm to an adult who the Department has
   determined is in need of protective services, and treatment is refused, the
   Department may refer, with appropriate affidavits, the matter to the
   Corporation Counsel for a temporary protective order under § 7(a) and 8 of
   the Act (D.C. Code, 2001 Ed. § 7-1906(a) and 7-1907).
