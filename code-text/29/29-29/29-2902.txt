   2902.3. When the police determine that police intervention is not warranted,
   they shall inform the Department of Human Services.

   2902.5. The police shall provide the Department of Human Services and, where
   appropriate, the Office of the Corporation Counsel with any information that

   crime shall be released only in such form as may be appropriate.

   2902.6. The Department of Human Services or any APS worker involved in the
   investigation of a matter requiring police intervention shall provide the
