                                  DC REGULATIONS

CALCULATION OF OUTLIER PAYMENTS (§ 29-4808)

4808.1. The APDRG prospective payment system shall provide for an additional
   payment for outliers based on inpatient costs. High-cost outliers are cases
   with costs exceeding two point five (2.5) times the standard deviation from
   the mean for each APDRG classification. When the cost of a case exceeds the
   high-cost outlier threshold, the payment for the case shall be the sum of the
   base payment as described in Subsection 4800.3 and the outlier payment
   calculated pursuant to Subsection 4808.2.   Effective October 1, 2012 and
   annually thereafter, thresholds shall be adjusted for inflation, based upon
   the CMS market basket factor for hospitals.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
    	Each claim with a cost that exceeds the high-cost outlier threshold shall be
   subject to an outlier payment. The amount of the outlier payment shall be
   calculated pursuant to the following formula:
   
   
   
   [High cost outlier threshold minus (allowed charges X hospital cost to charge
   ratio)] X 0.80 or other multiplier that results in an estimated maximum of 5%
   of inpatient payments as high cost outliers.  This factor shall be set October
   1, 2012, and annually thereafter, based upon a review of claims history from
   the previous fiscal year.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
    	The cost to charge ratio shall be hospital-specific.  Effective October 1,
   2012, and annually thereafter, the cost to charge ratio shall be developed
   based upon information obtained from each hospital’s prior year submitted
   cost report for the fiscal year that ends prior to October 1 of the prior
   calendar year.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
    	The APDRG prospective payment system shall provide for an adjustment to
   payments for extremely-low-cost inpatient cases. Low-cost outliers are cases
   with costs less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the average cost of a case.
   Each claim with a cost that is less than the low-cost outlier threshold shall
   be subject to a partial DRG payment. The amount of the payment shall be the
   lesser of the APDRG amount and a prorated payment, based on the ratio of
   covered days to the average length of stay associated with the APDRG category.
   Effective October 1, 2012, and annually thereafter, the threshold shall be
   adjusted for inflation based upon the CMS market basket factor for hospitals.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
    	The prorated payment shall be calculated as follows:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   	The base APDRG payment (Base payment times the APDRG service intensity
   weight) shall be divided by the average length of stay.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   	The amount established in Subsection 4808.5(a) shall be multiplied by the sum
   of the number of covered days plus one (1) day.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
    	For those APDRG categories where there was insufficient data to calculate a
   reliable mean or standard deviation the outlier threshold shall be calculated
   using an alternate method as set forth below:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   	The outlier threshold shall be equal to the product of the weight of the
   APDRG and the average outlier multiplier.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   	The average outlier multiplier shall be determined by dividing the outlier
   threshold by the APDRG weight for all categories where the outlier threshold
   is calculated as two point five (2.5) standard deviations above the mean.
