COST REPORTING AND RECORD MAINTENANCE (§ 29-4811)

4811.1. Each hospital shall submit an annual cost report to DHCF within one
   hundred fifty (150) days after the close of the hospital’s cost reporting
   period.  Each cost report shall cover a twelve (12) month cost reporting
   period, which shall be the same as the hospital’s fiscal year, unless DHCF
   has approved an exception.

   4811.2. Upon written request, the DHCF Director may grant a provider
   additional time to submit a cost report if the provider is unable to complete
   and submit its cost report when due as a result of circumstances beyond the
   provider’s control.

   4811.3. Each hospital shall complete its cost report in accordance with DHCF
   instructions and forms and shall include any supporting documentation required
   by DHCF.  DHCF shall review the cost report for completeness, accuracy,
   compliance, and reasonableness through a desk audit.

   4811.4. The submission of an incomplete cost report shall be treated as a
   failure to file a cost report as required by Subsection 4811.1, and the
   hospital shall be so notified.

   4811.5. DHCF shall issue a delinquency notice to the hospital if the hospital
   does not submit its cost report when due or when the hospital is notified
   pursuant to Subsection 4811.3 that its submitted cost report is incomplete.

   4811.6. If the hospital does not submit a complete cost report within thirty
   (30) days after the date of the notice of delinquency, an amount equal to
   seventy-five percent (75%) of the hospital’s payment for the month that cost
   report was due shall be withheld each month until the cost report is received.

   4811.7. DHCF shall pay the withheld funds promptly after receipt of the
   completed cost report and documentation that meets the requirements of this
   section.

   4811.8. Each hospital shall maintain sufficient financial records and
   statistical data for proper determination of allowable costs.

   4811.9. Each hospital’s accounting and related records, including the
   general ledger and books of original entry, and all transaction documents and
   statistical data, are permanent records and shall be retained for a period of
   not less than five (5) years after the filing of a cost report or until the
   Notice of Final Program Reimbursement is received, whichever is later.

   4811.10. If the records relate to a cost reporting period under audit or
   appeal, records shall be retained until the audit or appeal is completed.

   4811.11. Payments made to related organizations and the reason for each
   payment to related organizations shall be disclosed by the hospital.

   4811.12. Each hospital shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	Use the accrual method of accounting; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Prepare the cost report according to generally accepted accounting
   principles and all Medicaid Program instructions.
