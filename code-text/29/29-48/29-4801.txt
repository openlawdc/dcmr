CALCULATION OF BASE PAYMENT RATES (§ 29-4801)

4801.1. For purposes of establishing the base payment rates, the participating
   hospitals located in the District of Columbia shall be separated into three
   (3) peer groups as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	Children’s Hospitals: Children’s National Medical Center;
   
   
   
   (b)	Community Hospitals: Providence Hospital, Sibley Hospital, and United
   Medical Center; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Major Teaching Hospitals: Georgetown University Hospital, George
   Washington University Hospital, Howard University Hospital, and Washington
   Hospital Center.

   4801.2. Effective October 1, 2012, the base year period shall be each
   hospital’s fiscal year that ends prior to October 1, 2011.

   4801.3. Effective October 1, 2012, the base payment rate for each hospital
   shall be developed utilizing costs from each hospital’s submitted cost
   report for the fiscal year that ends prior to October 1, 2011, as well as
   facility case mix data, claims data, and discharge data from all participating
   hospitals for the District’s fiscal year ending September 30, 2011.

   4801.4. Effective October 1, 2013, and annually thereafter, the base payment
   rate for each hospital shall be developed utilizing costs from each
   hospital’s submitted cost report for the fiscal year that ends prior to
   October 1 of the prior calendar year, as well as facility case mix data,
   claims data, and discharge data from all participating hospitals for the
   District’s most recently completely fiscal year.

   4801.5. Effective October 1, 2012, and annually thereafter, the costs set
   forth in subsection 4801.3 shall be updated by applying the cost-to-charge
   ratio determined by each hospital’s submitted cost report for the fiscal
   year that ends prior to October 1 of the previous calendar year.

   4801.6. The final base year payment rate for each hospital shall be equal to
   the peer group average cost per discharge calculated pursuant to section 4803,
   plus the hospital-specific cost per discharge of indirect medical education
   calculated pursuant to Section 4804, subject to a gain/loss corridor as set
   forth in Subsection 4801.7.

   4801.7. Subject to federal upper payment limits, each hospital’s base year
   payment rate shall not exceed a rate that approximates an overall payment to
   cost ratio of ninety-eight percent (98%) for the base year.  The payment to
   cost ratio is determined by modeling payments to each facility using claims
   data from the District’s most recently completely fiscal year.
