TRANSFER CASES AND ABBREVIATED STAYS (§ 29-4809)

4809.1. For each claim involving a transfer, DHCF shall pay the transferring
   hospital the lesser of the APDRG amount or prorated payment based on the ratio
   of covered days to the average length of stay associated with the APDRG
   category.  The prorated payment shall be calculated pursuant to the formula
   set forth in Subsection 4808.5.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   	The hospital from which the patient is ultimately discharged shall receive a
   payment equal to the total APDRG payment.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
    	All transfers except for documented emergency cases shall be authorized and
   approved by DHCF before the transfer as a condition of payment.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
    	Same day discharges shall not be paid as inpatient hospital stays unless the
   patient’s discharge status is death.
