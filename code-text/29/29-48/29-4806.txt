                                  DC REGULATIONS

CALCULATION OF APDRG SERVICE INTENSITY WEIGHTS (ยง 29-4806)

4806.1. The service intensity weights shall be based upon the discharge data
   base supplied by 3M with the version 26 APDRG grouper and centered for
   participating District of Columbia hospitals.

   4806.2. The average charge per discharge shall be determined by identifying
   the average charge for cases within each discharge category, excluding
   outliers.

   4806.3. The service intensity weight for each claim shall be equal to the
   ratio of the average charge per discharge for each APDRG to the aggregate
   average charge per discharge.

   4806.4. The amount calculated in subsection 4806.3 shall be adjusted by a
   common factor to achieve a District wide case mix of one point zero (1.0) for
   the base year.

   4806.5. The service intensity weights shall be modified periodically as the 3M
   APDRG weights are updated and new grouper versions are adopted.
