   7608.2. The HPRP assistance for utility arrearages shall not exceed two
   thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for an individual or three thousand
   five hundred dollars ($3,500) for a family.  The HPRP program shall make the
   determination regarding the appropriate amount of the HPRP benefit in
   accordance with subsection 7605.2 and other provisions of this chapter.  The
   maximum amounts provided in this section do not entitle an eligible household
   to the maximum allowed benefit, nor require the Provider to provide the

   that an eligible household receives utility services.  Provision of a utility
   deposit as an HPRP benefit will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the
   HPRP Provider, taking into consideration the unique circumstances of the
   eligible household that makes a utility deposit necessary.
