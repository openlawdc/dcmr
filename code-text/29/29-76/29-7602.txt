APPLICANT UNIT (§ 29-7602)

7602.1. The applicant unit shall be composed of each individual who lives in
   the same household and whose needs, assets, and income are combined to
   determine eligibility.

   7602.2. The applicant unit shall include:
   
   
   
   (a)	Persons related by full or half blood;
   
   
   
   (b)	Persons related by legal adoption;
   
   
   
   (c)	Persons related by marriage, including stepchildren and unmarried parents
   of a common child who live together; or
   
   
   
   (d)	Persons with legal responsibility for an unrelated minor child, or an
   unrelated adult with a disability.

   7602.3. The applicant unit may include any person not included by subsection
   7602.2, regardless of blood relationship, age, or marriage, whose history and
   statements reasonably tend to demonstrate that they intend to remain together
   as a family unit.

   7602.4. A person temporarily away from home due to employment,
   hospitalization, vacation, or a visit shall be considered to be living in the
   household.  A minor child who is away at school is considered to be living in

   holidays and during the summer vacations.

   7602.5. An applicant unit may be comprised of a single individual.

   7602.6. The name of a non-household member on a rental lease shall have no
   effect on eligibility, except that receipt of benefits under sections 7607
   through 7610 shall be conditioned on:
   
   
   
   (a)	The applicant documenting that he or she is responsible for the payment;
   and
   
   
   
   (b)	Both the applicant and the landlord agreeing to change the lease to
   reflect only the applicant’s name, unless the name of the non-household
   member is a co-signor required by the landlord.
