SCOPE (§ 29-7600)

7600.1. The purpose of the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing
   Program (“HPRP” or “Program”) is to provide homelessness prevention
   assistance to households who would otherwise become homeless – many due to
   economic crisis – and to provide assistance to rapidly re-house persons who
   are homeless and have the capacity to quickly achieve stable housing
   independent of HPRP assistance.

   7600.2. The provisions of this chapter shall provide the application process,
   eligibility criteria, benefit determination, and appeal procedures for the
   Program.

   7600.3. Nothing in these rules shall be interpreted to mean that HPRP
   assistance is an entitlement.  This Program shall be subject to annual
   appropriations and the availability of funds.

   7600.4. The Department of Human Services (Department) may execute contracts,
   grants, and other agreements as necessary to carry out the Program.
