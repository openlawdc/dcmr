                                  DC REGULATIONS

DIRECTED PLAN OF CORRECTION (§ 29-4113)

In lieu of termination in situations where the ICF/IID is not in compliance with
the federal CoPs, and residents are not in immediate jeopardy, DHCF may require
an ICF/IID to take prompt, timely action specified by DHCF to achieve and
maintain compliance with CoPs and other District of Columbia Medicaid
requirements. These actions specified by DHCF shall constitute a Directed Plan
of Correction (DPoC).







           The DPoC shall be developed in coordination with and approved by DOH,
DHCF, and DDS, incorporating findings from DDS’ Continuous Quality Improvement
Plan.







           The DPoC shall specify:







How corrective action shall be accomplished for beneficiaries found to have been
affected by the deficient practice and include remedies that shall be
implemented;







How the facility shall identify other individuals who may have been   affected
by the same deficient practice but not previously identified, and how the
facility shall act to remedy the effect of the deficient practices for these
individuals;







What measures and actions shall be put into place to ensure that the deficient
practice(s) is/are being corrected and future noncompliance prevented;







Timelines, including major milestones for completion of all corrective action in
the DCoP;







How compliance shall be determined; and







How the DPoC relates to other alternative sanctions.







            A state monitor shall oversee implementation of the DPoC and
evaluate compliance with the plan.







            DHCF may terminate the Medicaid provider agreement of an ICF/IID
that is unable to meet the timeline for completion of all corrective actions in
the DCoP.
