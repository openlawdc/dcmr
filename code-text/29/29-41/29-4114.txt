                                  DC REGULATIONS

DIRECTED IN-SERVICE TRAINING (ยง 29-4114)

In lieu of termination in situations where the ICF/IID is not in compliance with
federal CoPs, but residents are not in immediate jeopardy, DHCF may require an
ICF/IID to implement Directed In-Service Training (DIST) for deficiencies
determined by the District to be correctable through education.  This
alternative sanction shall require the staff and relevant contractors of the
ICF/IID to attend in-service trainings and demonstrate competency in the
knowledge and skills presented during the trainings.







            DHCF, in consultation with DOH and DDS, shall develop the areas for
ICF/IID staff and contractor training by incorporating the findings from the
Continuous Quality Improvement Plan.







            Facilities shall use training programs developed by well-established
organizations with prior experience and expertise in training, services for
individuals with intellectual disabilities, and the operation of ICF/IID to meet
training requirements described in this section. All programs and personnel used
to deliver the training shall be approved by DHCF prior to their use.







            The ICF/IID shall bear the expense of the DIST.







            A state monitor shall oversee implementation of DIST, and shall
ensure compliance with the requirements.







           DHCF may terminate the provider agreement of an ICF/IID that is
unable to meet the timeline for full and successful completion of the DIST.
