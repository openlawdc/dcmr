                                  DC REGULATIONS

DISCHARGE PROCEDURES (§ 29-4609)

4609.1. Providers shall discharge a client from an MCOTT Program when a
   client, or his/her legal representative, if any, and MCOTT Program staff
   mutually agree to the termination of services. Circumstances giving rise to a
   consideration of termination include, but are not limited to:
   
   
   
   (a)	The client moves outside of the MCOTT Program&#8217;s geographic area of
   responsibility. In such cases, the Provider shall arrange for transfer of
   mental health service responsibility to a provider within the area where the
   client relocates. The Provider shall maintain contact with the client until
   the service transfer has occurred; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Demonstration of the client&#8217;s ability to function in all major role
   areas (work, social, self-care) without requiring assistance from the MCOTT
   Program and with high likelihood to maintain the functioning with less
   intensive intervention, with this determination to be made by both the client
   and MCOTT Program staff and with a reduced likelihood of returning to one of
   the treatment categories in 4607.2.

   4609.2. A MCOTT Program shall document the discharge of each MCOTT client in
   the client&#8217;s record. Such documentation shall include the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The reason for the client&#8217;s discharge;
   
   
   
   (b)	The client&#8217;s status and condition at the time of discharge;
   
   
   
   (c)	A written final evaluation summary of the client&#8217;s progress toward
   the goals set forth in the ITP;
   
   
   
   (e)	A plan developed, in conjunction with the client, for care after discharge
   and for follow-up; and
   
   
   
   (f)	The signature of the Primary Case Manager, Program Director, the
   psychiatrist and the client.
