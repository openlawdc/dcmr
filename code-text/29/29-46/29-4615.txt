WAIVER PROVISIONS (ยง 29-4615)

4615.1. MAA may grant a waiver of any requirement of these Program Standards
   when the MAA determines that granting a waiver would not diminish the
   effectiveness of the MCOTT Program, violate the purposes of the MCOTT Program,
   or adversely affect MCOTT client&#8217;s health and welfare. Such waivers
   shall be granted on a case by case basis and for good cause shown, such as a
   client&#8217;s not being available due to the client&#8217;s temporary absence
   from the area.

   4615.2. MAA shall not grant a waiver of MCOTT clients&#8217; rights, or
   federal, state and local laws and regulations.
