STATEMENT OF PURPOSE (§ 29-6201)

6201.1. The purpose of this Chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
   welfare of children who are receiving care in a youth shelter, runaway
   shelter, emergency care facility, or youth group home through the formulation,

   residential facilities requires a collaboration between the facility, the
   licensing agency, and the contracting entity.

   residential facilities requires the placement of children in facilities
   serving children of similar ages, levels of development, and clinical needs in
   the least restrictive, most normative environment that is clinically
   appropriate.
