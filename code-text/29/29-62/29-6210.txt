   inspection reports of the facility required under § 6207.2, and the on-site
   inspection report of the facility required under § 6207.3, and either grant
   or deny an application for a renewal of an original annual license within
   ninety (90) days of receiving the information required by § 6210.2. If the
   applicable licensing agency denies the facility&#8217;s application for
   renewal of an annual license, the applicable licensing agency may issue the
   facility a provisional license or a restricted license.

   6210.4. The applicable licensing agency shall notify the applicant in writing

   provisional license or a restricted license satisfies the requirements of an
   annual license, the applicable licensing agency shall issue the facility a
   renewal of an annual license.

   6210.6. Upon approval of an application for renewal of an original annual
   license, the applicant will receive by mail a license that sets forth the
   conditions under which the facility may operate.
