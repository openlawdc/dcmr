GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES (ยง 29-6205)

6205.1. A grievance is a complaint based upon relations between residents,
   relations between residents and staff, the facility&#8217;s programs and
   physical conditions, the use of discipline, or other issues concerning the
   resident&#8217;s care, but not based upon alleged abuse or neglect or alleged
   criminal activity. A grievance may be brought by a resident or brought on a
   resident&#8217;s behalf by his or her representative, parent(s) or
   guardian(s), attorney, guardian ad litem, or staff. Allegations of abuse or
   neglect shall be reported pursuant to ยง 6204. Alleged criminal activity shall
   be reported to the Metropolitan Police Department.

   6205.2. Each facility shall develop and follow a written plan for clear and
   simple grievance procedures regarding the receipt, consideration, and
   resolution of grievances.

   6205.3. The facility shall post a copy of the grievance procedures in the
   facility and explain and give a copy to each resident, and to the
   resident&#8217;s parent(s) or guardian(s) upon admission.

   6205.4. The facility shall obtain a statement signed by each resident, and the
   resident&#8217;s parent(s) or guardian(s), acknowledging receipt of a copy of
   the facility&#8217;s grievance procedures or documentation of efforts made to
   obtain the signature.

   required to transmit a grievance through the person who is the subject of the
   grievance.

   6205.6. The facility shall ensure against retaliation by staff or by other
   residents against the person making the grievance and, where the grievance is

   serve on the grievance board resolving the grievance.

   board to resolve the grievance.
