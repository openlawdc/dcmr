AMOUNT (§ 29-7008)

7008.1. The institution shall determine the amount of the annual grant award
   for each student in accordance with the requirements of this section.

   7008.2. The amount of tuition assistance that will be provided to each
   eligible student enrolled in a public eligible institution shall be no more
   than the difference between the tuition and fees charged for in-State students
   and the tuition and fees charged for out-of-State students.

   7008.3. If the public eligible institution has an in-County rate in addition
   to an in State rate, the in-County rate, and not the in-State rate, will be
   used in making the calculation under §7008.2.

   7008.4. For enrollment at public eligible institutions, the maximum amount of
   assistance that an eligible student may receive is not more than $10,000 for
   any unpaid tuition or fees for any one award year (as defined in §481 of the
   Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. §1088)), and a lifetime
   total of not more than $50,000.

   7008.5. Students enrolled in a public eligible institution may receive the
   difference between in-State and out-of-State tuition and fees each payment
   period they are enrolled as long as they do not exceed the award year maximum
   of $10,000.

   7008.6. The amount of tuition assistance that will be provided to each
   eligible student enrolled full-time in a private non profit eligible
   institution shall be not more than $2,500 for any unpaid tuition or fees in
   one award year and a lifetime total of not more than $12,500.

   7008.7. For any payment period, the award shall be prorated for students
   attending private institutions and enrolled less than full time (less than 12
   credit hours in a term or 24 clock hours per week) in the following manner:
   
   
   
   (a)	Students enrolled 3/4 time (9 credit hours in a term or 18 clock hours per
   week) shall be eligible for 3/4 of the calculated full-time award for the
   payment period; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Students enrolled half time (6 credit hours in a term or 12 clock hours
   per week) shall be eligible for 1/2 of the calculated full-time award for the
   payment period.

   7008.8. Students who attend an eligible institution on less than a half-time
   basis are not eligible for the grant.

   7008.9. If the school’s academic calendar contains nonstandard terms, i.e.,
   terms other than semesters, trimesters, or quarters, the school shall
   determine the student’s enrollment status for each nonstandard term in
   accordance with the calculation found in 34 C.F.R. §690.63 (d)(1)(ii) (1999),
   as may be amended from time to time.

   7008.10. The annual award shall not result in the student receiving financial
   assistance for tuition and fees that exceeds the student’s cost for tuition
   and fees.

   7008.11. The tuition assistance provided under this Chapter shall apply only
   to tuition and fees:
   
   
   
   (a)	Except as provided in §7008.11(b), the institution shall presume that any
   tuition assistance grant funds disbursed to the student’s account shall be
   used to pay the student’s tuition and fees regardless of whether the
   institution credits those funds directly to the student’s tuition and fees;
   and
   
   
   
   (b)	The institution shall not presume that the tuition assistance grant funds
   were used to pay tuition and fees to the extent that those charges were
   satisfied for a payment period by other assistance such as grants,
   scholarships, tuition or fee waivers, or tuition remission that could only be
   used for tuition and fees. If the tuition and fees are satisfied by this other
   assistance, the student shall not receive a grant for that payment period.

   7008.12. The institution shall ensure that the amount of the annual award to
   an eligible student under this chapter supplements, and does not supplant, the
   amount of grant aid that would otherwise be provided to the student.

   7008.13. If adding aid under this Chapter would make the student’s total aid
   package exceed the cost of tuition and fees, the institution shall use the
   funds under this Chapter to reduce the student’s (federal and nonfederal)
   loans and work-study only to the extent that the loans and work-study would be
   used to pay for tuition and fees.
