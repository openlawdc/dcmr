7004.1. Based on the application and any other records, documents, and
   information provided to the Mayor, an employee designated by the Director of

   he or she is eligible to receive tuition assistance shall be mailed by regular
   mail, and the letter informing the applicant that he or she is ineligible to
   receive tuition assistance shall be mailed by certified mail. In addition, if
   the student is determined to be eligible for the tuition assistance, the Grant
   Program Office will so inform the institution(s) listed on the student’s
   application as schools the student is most likely to attend by providing a
   list of eligible students to the institution or by posting this list of
   eligible students on an official Website for the D.C. Tuition Assistance
   Program.

   7004.3. The applicant shall provide a copy of the LOE to the financial aid
   office of the public or private eligible institution to which the applicant is
   enrolled or intends to enroll in order for the applicant to receive the
   tuition assistance.

   7004.4. If the Grant Program Office determines that the applicant is not
