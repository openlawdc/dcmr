2550.1. A client applying for or receiving shelter or supportive housing
   services covered by this Chapter shall have the right to appeal through a fair
   hearing, any decision by the Department or a Provider to:

   (c)  	Suspend the client from shelter or supportive housing;

   longer than ten (10) days but no longer than thirty (30) days; or
   
   
   
   (e)	Terminate services to the client.

   2550.2. In addition to the bases for appeal in subsection 2550.1, a client may
   request a fair hearing to obtain any legally available and practicable remedy
   for any alleged violation of:
   
   
   
   (a)  	Any applicable Provider standards listed in sections 2515 through 2519;
   or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The client rights listed in sections 2512 and 2513.

   2550.3. A client shall request a fair hearing, orally or in writing, within
   ninety (90) days of receiving written notice of the adverse action.

   2550.4. The Mayor shall treat a fair hearing request made by a client
   representative in the same manner as it would be treated if it were made
   directly by the client; provided, that the Mayor subsequently receives written
   documentation authorizing the client representative to act on behalf of the
   client in accordance with the requirements of section 1005 of the District of
   Columbia Public Assistance Act of 1982, effective April 6, 1982 (D.C. Law
   4-101; D.C. Official Code § 4-210.05 (2008 Repl.)).

   2550.5. A request for a fair hearing shall be made to the Office of
   Administrative Hearings, or to the client’s Provider, the Department, or the
   Mayor.  If the request is made orally, the individual receiving the request
   shall promptly acknowledge the request, reduce it to writing, and file the
   request for a fair hearing with the Office of Administrative Hearings.

   2550.6. Any client who requests a fair hearing within fifteen (15) days after
   receipt of written notice of a suspension or termination of shelter or
   supportive housing shall continue to receive shelter or supportive housing
   pending a final decision from the fair hearing proceedings.  This right to
   continuation of shelter or supportive housing pending appeal shall not apply
   in the case of a transfer pursuant to section 2521 or an emergency action
   pursuant to section 2524.

   2550.7. If a client requests a fair hearing in accordance with subsection
   2550.6 but leaves the program as evidenced by unexplained absences from the
   program for more than 30 minutes after lights out in low barrier shelter or 48
   hours in temporary shelter and supportive housing, or by informing the
   Provider that they are residing elsewhere, the Provider shall be allowed to
   give the client’s bed or unit to another client.  If the client leaves any
   property at the facility, the program shall be able to remove the property
   from the bed or unit, and store the property in accordance with section 2520.

   2550.8. If, following a client’s successful appeal, the original placement
   has no available unit or bed the client shall receive the first available
   opening at the original placement.  Until such time as a placement in the
   original program becomes available, the managing agency, whether the
   Department or its designee, shall give the client the highest priority for and
   offer to the client the most similar opening available in the Continuum of
   Care.
