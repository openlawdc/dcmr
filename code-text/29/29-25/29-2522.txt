29-2522)

2522.1. If a client fails or refuses to comply with the Provider’s Program
   Rules and the client responsibilities listed in section 2514, or engages in
   any of the behaviors listed in subsection 2523.1(b), the Provider may suspend
   services to the client for an appropriate period of time in light of the
   severity of the act or acts leading to the suspension, but in no case for a
   period longer than thirty (30) days.

   2522.2. A Provider may suspend a client from shelter, supportive housing, or
   supportive services only when:
   
   
   
   (a) 	The client has received proper notice of the Program Rules, including
   client responsibilities, and prohibited behaviors;
   
   
   
   (b)  	The Provider has made a good faith effort to enable the client to comply
   with the Program Rules so that the client is able to continue receiving
   services without suspension; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The Provider has made a reasonable effort, given the severity of the
   situation, to transfer the client to another Provider within the Continuum of
   Care as set forth in subsection 2523.1(d).

   unattended in a shelter or supportive housing unit.

   2522.4. A Provider shall give written and oral notice to clients of their
   suspension from services at least fifteen (15) days before the effective date
   of the suspension, except for a suspension of supportive services for a period
   shorter than ten (10) days.  For suspension of supportive services for a
   period shorter than ten (10) days, the Provider shall, at a minimum, give oral
   notice and document such notice to the client in the client’s file.

   2522.5. A Provider’s written notice to a client of his or her suspension
   shall include:

   occurred;
   
   
   
   (c)	A reference to the statute, regulation, or Program Rule pursuant to which
   the suspension is being implemented;

   deadlines for instituting the appeal; and
   
   
   
   (e)	A statement of the client’s right to continuation of shelter or
   supportive housing services pending the outcome of any fair hearing requested
   within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice of a suspension of
   such services.

   section in any way that interferes with a client’s tenancy rights under a
   lease agreement governed by title 14 of the District of Columbia Municipal
   Regulations.
