                                  DC REGULATIONS

STI PROGRAM – REPORTING CHANGE IN HOUSEHOLD INCOME (§ 29-2531)

2531.1. It shall be the responsibility of each participating household to
   report to their STI Program Provider case manager, in writing, any change in
   the household’s monthly income as soon as the change occurs.

   2531.2. Upon written notification by the household of a change in the
   household’s annual income, the Provider shall determine if there is a need
   to recalculate the amount of the household’s housing cost contribution,
   based on the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	If the household is reporting a decrease in monthly income of fifty
   dollars ($50) or more and the annual recalculation is not in progress, an
   interim recalculation shall be conducted;
   
   
   
   (b)	If the household is reporting an increase in monthly income of one hundred
   dollars ($100) or more, an interim recertification shall be conducted;
   however, if the household’s annual recalculation is in progress, or is
   scheduled to begin within ninety (90) days, no interim recertification shall
   be conducted, but the time of the scheduled annual recalculation may be
   advanced.

   2531.3. The effective date of a change in the amount of the rental assistance
   as a result of an interim recalculation shall be the same as for an annual
   recalculation as set forth in subsections 2530.5 and 2530.6.

   2531.4. A person’s intentional failure to accurately report income or
   assets, or changes in income or assets required under sections 2528 through
   2531 that results in greater assistance than the household would otherwise be
   entitled to, may be subject to penalties, including termination pursuant to
   section 2523, and/or criminal or civil prosecution under D.C. Official Code §
   4-218.01 (2008 Repl.) if such intentional failure to report is substantiated.
