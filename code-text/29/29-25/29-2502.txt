INTAKE FOR SEVERE WEATHER SHELTER FOR INDIVIDUAL ADULTS (§ 29-2502)

Intake for severe weather shelter for individual adults shall consist of an
eligibility determination and placement in a shelter.







An individual adult applicant shall apply directly to and be determined eligible
for severe weather shelter by the Provider from whom the individual is seeking
services.







Placement of eligible applicants in a specific severe weather shelter shall be
on a first come, first served basis.  If there is no available space in the
shelter for an eligible applicant, the shelter shall arrange transportation for
that person to another appropriate shelter that has available space.







A Provider of severe weather shelter may fill a bed or unit allocated to an
individual who leaves the facility for more than thirty (30) minutes after
lights out.  If the individual later returns to the severe weather shelter and
the original bed was given to another individual, the Provider shall give the
individual another bed.  If no bed is available, the Provider shall arrange
transportation for the individual to a severe weather shelter with an available
bed.
