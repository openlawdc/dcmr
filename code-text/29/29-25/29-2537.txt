PSH PROGRAM – REFERRAL PROCESS (§ 29-2537)

2537.1. When the Department or its designee has available placements in the
   PSH Program, the Department or its designee shall review all vulnerability
   assessments of individuals and families not previously placed in the PSH
   Program or other permanent supportive housing program to determine which
   individuals and families have priority for the available placements.

   2537.2. When the Department or its designee receives funding for a significant
   number of new placements, the Department shall publish in the D.C. Register a
   notice of the new number of placements and provide notice of the expected
   review period for the Department to conduct vulnerability assessments to
   determine priority for those placements.  Such notice shall be published so
   that a minimum of three (3) weeks is available for interested persons to
   complete a vulnerability assessment and be considered for those placements.

   2537.3. Upon identifying those individuals and families with the highest
   vulnerability scores, and applying any applicable prioritizing factors
   pursuant to subsection 2536.4, the Department or its designee shall seek to
   locate the identified persons through service Providers, outreach workers,
   Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) data, or other available means.

   2537.4. Upon location of the persons identified pursuant to subsection 2537.2,
   the Department or its designee shall assign a case manager to the individual
   or family to assist in completing the placement.

   2537.5. If the individual or family cannot be located, the Department or its
   designee shall document efforts to locate the person and shall retain the
   vulnerability assessment for a future PSH Program referral.

   2537.6. If the Department or its designee identifies but is unable to locate
   the individual or family for two (2) distinct referral groups, the Department
   or its designee shall remove the applicable vulnerability assessment from the
   pool of assessments available for referral.

   2537.7. Any individual or family whose assessment is removed pursuant to
   subsection 2537.56 may retake a vulnerability assessment and be considered for
   available or future PSH referrals at any time.
