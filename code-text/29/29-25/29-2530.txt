STI PROGRAM – ANNUAL RECALCULATION OF TENANT RENT CONTRIBUTION (§ 29-2530)

2530.1. The STI Program shall examine and recalculate annually each
   household’s housing cost contribution to ensure that participating
   households are paying the appropriate tenant housing cost contribution.

   2530.2. For each household, the annual recalculation date shall be twelve (12)
   months after the date of the initial housing placement. The STI Program may
   adjust the annual recalculation date in order to schedule some or all
   household annual recalculations at the same time.

   2530.3. Each household is responsible for providing to the STI Program the
   appropriate documents confirming income, family composition or other
   information requested by the Program during an annual recalculation.

   2530.4. If the STI Program determines that a change in the housing cost
   assistance is required as a result of an annual recalculation, the Provider
   shall give the household a written notice of the change in the household’s
   rent contribution, which shall include:
   
   
   
   (a)	A clear statement of the factual basis of the change in the household’s
   housing cost contribution;
   
   
   
   (b)	A clear and detailed statement of the computation of the household’s new
   housing cost contribution;
   
   
   
   (c)	A clear and detailed statement of the computation of the STI Program’s
   housing cost assistance;
   
   
   
   (d)	A clear statement of the effective date of the new household housing cost
   contribution;
   
   
   
   (e)	A reference to the regulation or policy pursuant to which the change was
   made; and
   
   
   
   (f) 	A clear and complete statement of the client&#8217;s right to a
   reconsideration of the change of household housing cost contribution by the
   Department or the Department’s designee if such reconsideration is requested
   within ten (10) days of receipt of the Notice, including the appropriate
   deadlines for instituting the request for reconsideration.

   2530.5. If a recalculation of tenant housing cost contribution results in a
   decrease in the amount of the tenant contribution and an increase in the STI
   Program assistance, the change shall be effective the first day of the month
   (or the next day that rent is due) following the completion of the
   recalculation.

   2530.6. If a recalculation of tenant rent contribution results in an increase
   in the amount of the tenant contribution and a decrease in the STI Program
   rental assistance, the change shall be effective thirty (30) calendars days
   after written notice of the change in assistance is provided to the household.
