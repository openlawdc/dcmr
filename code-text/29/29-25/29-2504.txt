ASSESSMENT AND REFERRAL FOR INDIVIDUAL ADULTS IN LOW BARRIER SHELTER (§
29-2504)

Individuals receiving low barrier shelter services shall be offered assessment
and case management services with an appropriately trained, qualified, and
supervised case manager.







 	Individuals in low barrier shelter may choose to have an assessment interview
with a case manager for the purpose of developing a Service Plan and identifying
resources and programs for which the individual may be eligible.  A Service Plan
is not required for the client to receive referrals to resources and programs
for which the individual may be eligible.







 	For participants in low barrier shelters, the case manager shall seek to make
the appropriate referrals that best support an individual’s return to, or
placement in, permanent or transitional housing. 







 	For participants in low barrier shelters, an individual that is referred to a
program, but cannot immediately be served due to lack of capacity, may be placed
on one (1) or more waiting lists for the program from which the individual is
seeking services, if the Provider maintains a waiting list.
