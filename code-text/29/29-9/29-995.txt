   995.3. For services where the procedure code does not fall within the Medicare
   fee schedule, an alternative method, as set forth in § 995.4, shall be used
   to establish the Medicaid reimbursement rate.

   995.4. When making a determination to establish the Medicaid reimbursement
   rate using an alternative method for physician and specialty services, in
   addition to using professional judgment, the following factors may be
   considered:
   
   
   
   (a)	Practitioner fees;
   
   
   
   (b)	Fee schedules from other states;
   
   
   
   (c)	Similar procedures with established fees; or
   
   
   
   (d)	Private insurance payments.

   995.5. Beginning Fiscal Year 2010, and annually thereafter, all rates for

   995.6. All physician and specialty services reimbursement rates shall be
   located on the Department of Health Care Finance website.

   995.9. For each provider who qualifies for payment in accordance with Section
   995.4, DHCF shall:
   
   
   
   	(a)	Establish a fund that shall be equal to and shall not exceed the
   difference between one hundred percent (100%) of the Medicare rate in effect
   for the period referenced in Section 995.4 and eighty percent (80%) of the
   Medicare rate in effect for the period referenced in Section 995.4 (Medicaid

   February 29, 2012;
   
   
   
   	(b)	Pay a provider-specific supplemental payment based on the claims
   submitted to DHCF during the three (3) month period beginning May 1, 2013; and
   
   
   
   	(c)	Make certain that the total amount paid to each provider shall not exceed
   the amount set forth in Section 995.5(a).

   995.10. The supplemental payment shall be calculated as the total of each

   by each provider and added proportionally to the fee-for-service rate paid to
   that provider during the payment period.

   995.11. All payments shall be made as a lump sum adjustment at the end of the
