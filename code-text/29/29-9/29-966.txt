SPECIAL INCOME AND RESOURCE ALLOWANCES FOR COMMUNITY SPOUSES OF CERTAIN
INSTITUTIONALIZED PERSONS (§ 29-966)

966.1. If an institutionalized person is determined eligible for medical
   assistance, and has a spouse living in the community, and income of the
   institutionalized spouse is made available to (or for the benefit of) the
   community spouse, the amount of the institutionalized spouse’s monthly
   income that must be paid toward his or her cost of care shall be calculated in
   accordance with this section.

   966.2. To determine the amount to be contributed toward the cost of care,
   there shall be deducted from the institutionalized spouse’s monthly income
   the following amounts in the following order:
   
   
   
   (a)	A personal needs allowance of sixty dollars ($60) per month;
   
   
   
   (b)	The monthly income allowance for the community spouse, as determined under
   §966.3;
   
   
   
   (c)	A family allowance, for each family member, equal to one-third (1/3) of
   the amount by which the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance for a
   community spouse exceeds the amount of the monthly income of that family
   member;
   
   
   
   (d)	Amounts for incurred expenses for medical or remedial care for the
   institutionalized spouse (as provided under §1902(r) of the Social Security
   Act) (42 U.S.C. §1396(a));
   
   
   
   (e)	Amounts, if applicable, for guardianship or conservatorship fees
   authorized by court order; and
   
   
   
   (f)	Fees for representative payees as allowed under §5105 of the Omnibus
   Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.

   966.3. The community spouse monthly income allowance shall be the sum of the
   following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance; plus
   
   
   
   (b)	Any excess shelter allowance if applicable; and minus
   
   
   
   (c)	The monthly income of the community spouse.

   966.4. If the sum of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) in §966.3 exceeds one
   thousand five hundred and sixty-five dollars ($1,565) per month, the allowable
   sum shall be reduced to one-thousand five hundred and sixty-five dollars
   ($1,565), unless an additional amount is added as a result of a fair hearing
   decision or court order.

   966.5. The one thousand five hundred and sixty-five dollars ($1,565) figure in
   §966.4 shall be indexed for inflation.

   966.6. In calculating the excess shelter allowance, the utility allowance
   shall be calculated by the utilization of one of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The Standard Utility Allowance, which includes twenty-one dollars ($21)
   telephone allowance, under the Food Stamp program; or
   
   
   
   (b)	The actual utility expense for each utility.

   966.7. If the community spouse elects to use actual utility expenses, the
   community spouse shall submit three (3) months of actual utility cost for each
   utility including one (1) water bill.

   966.8. For purposes of the requirements of §966.7, the phrase “for each
   utility” shall mean electric, gas, heating oil and water.

   966.9. Utility expenses for a six (6) month period shall be determined by
   averaging three (3) months of actual cost for each utility.

   966.10. If the community spouse elects to use the actual utility expense
   allowance, the community spouse shall be eligible for a “telephone only”
   allowance of twenty-one dollars ($21).

   966.11. At the time of recertification, the community spouse shall have an
   opportunity to change the method used in calculating the utility expense
   allowance.

   966.12. For purposes of the requirements of §966.11, the phrase “change the
   method used” shall mean the community spouse shall be allowed to switch from
   the Standard Utility Allowance under the Food Stamp program to the actual
   utility expense or switch from the actual utility expense to the Standard
   Utility Allowance.

   966.13. The total value of the countable resources of an institutionalized
   spouse and community spouse shall be computed as of the date of the beginning
   of the institutionalized spouse’s first continuous period of
   institutionalization, and each spouse shall be deemed to have a spousal share
   equal to one-half (1/2) of the total value.

   966.14. In determining the resources of an institutionalized spouse at the
   time of application for medical assistance, the resources deemed to be
   available to the institutionalized spouse shall be the couple’s total
   resources minus the community spouse resource allowance computed in accordance
   with this section.

   966.15. The community spouse resource allowance shall be the amount (if any)
   by which the greatest of one (1) of the following exceeds the amount of the
   resources otherwise available to the community spouse (determined without
   regard to such an allowance):
   
   
   
   (a)	Twelve thousand five hundred and sixteen dollars ($12,516) indexed for
   inflation annually;
   
   
   
   (b)	The spousal share computed under §966.13, up to a ceiling of sixty-two
   thousand five hundred and eighty dollars ($62,580) indexed annually for
   inflation;
   
   
   
   (c)	The amount transferred under a court support order; or
   
   
   
   (d)	The amount designated by a fair hearing officer pursuant to §1924(e) of
   the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. §1396r-5).

   966.16. In accordance with Departmental procedures for a fair hearing, the
   community spouse or the institutional spouse shall be entitled to a fair
   hearing with respect to eligibility determination if an application for
   benefits under Medicaid has been made on behalf of the institutionalized
   spouse.

   966.17. All hearings and appeals shall be in accordance with D.C. Code, 2001
   Ed. §§4-210.1 to 4-210.18.

   allowance shall be held within thirty (30) days of the date of the request for
   a hearing.

   966.19. The institutionalized spouse or the community spouse shall be entitled
   to a fair hearing if they are dissatisfied with a determination of one of the

   (a)	The community spouse monthly income allowance;
   
   
   
   (b)	The amount of monthly income otherwise available to the community spouse
   (as described in §966.2 of these rules);
   
   
   
   (c)	The computation of the spousal share of resources;

   (e)	The determination of the community spouse resource allowance (as described
   in §966.15).

   966.20. If either spouse establishes that the community spouse needs income
   above the level otherwise provided by the minimum monthly maintenance needs
   allowance, due to exceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial
   duress, there shall be substituted for the minimum monthly maintenance needs
   allowance an amount adequate to provide the additional income that is
   necessary.

   966.21. If either spouse establishes that the community spouse resource
   allowance (in relation to the amount of income generated by such an allowance)
   is inadequate to raise the community spouse’s monthly income to the minimum
   monthly maintenance needs allowance, there shall be substituted for the
   community spouse resource allowance described in §966.15 an amount adequate
   to provide a minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance.
