   970.2. Beginning October 1, 2007 through September 30, 2008, the base year per
   diem rate paid in the District&#8217;s Fiscal Year 2002 shall be indexed for
   inflation from the District&#8217;s Fiscal Year 2002 through the
   District&#8217;s Fiscal Year 2008 using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
   Services Prospective Payment Skilled Nursing Facility Input Price Index

   970.4. [Repealed at 55 DCR 5275]

   970.5. In order to meet the Medicare upper limits requirement, the rate paid
   to each facility shall not exceed the amount that Medicare would pay for the
   same service. When necessary, each facility-specific prospective rate will be
   reduced to maintain compliance with the upper limit set by Medicare. The
   reduction factor shall be the same for each facility without regard to
   Medicaid utilization.

   970.6. The Medicaid Program may approve an adjustment to the facility specific
   per diem rate if the facility demonstrates that it incurred higher costs due
   to extraordinary circumstances beyond its control including, but not limited
   to strikes, fire, earthquake, flood, changes in federal or District law or
   rules regarding new services, wages, hours, or employee benefits or similar
   unusual occurrences with substantial effects.

   970.7. Each adjustment shall be made only to the extent the costs are
   reasonable, attributable to the circumstances specified, separately identified
   by the facility, and verified by the program.

   970.8. Effective December 30, 2000, in addition to the facility specific per
   diem rate calculated in accordance with subsection 970.1, the Medicaid Program
   shall pay an additional amount to an ICF/MR for each resident receiving active
   treatment services pursuant to the requirements set forth in subsections 970.9
   through 970.11.

   970.9. Active treatment services shall be provided in accordance with each
   resident&#8217;s individualized habilitation plan.

   970.10. Each ICF/MR shall enter into a written agreement with each provider of
   active treatment services which meets the requirements set forth in 42 CFR
   483.410(d).

   970.11. The additional amount paid to an ICF/MR for each resident receiving
   active treatment services shall be calculated by multiplying the per diem rate
   on the day preceding the effective date of these rules for each resident
   receiving active treatment services, times the number of days the resident
   receives active treatment services.
