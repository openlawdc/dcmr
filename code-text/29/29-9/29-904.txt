SKILLED OR INTERMEDIATE NURSING CARE FACILITIES (ยง 29-904)

904.1. In recognition of the fact that many Medicaid patients require more
   nursing care than the program presently will pay for, and therefore, it is
   difficult to locate sufficient placements for Medicaid patients, effective not
   later than June 5, 1983, the District Medicaid program shall eliminate the
   present ceiling on the number of allowable nursing hours that may be claimed
   for reimbursement. While this action will increase federal reimbursement for
   District long term care facilities, this increase will be offset by increased
   costs for placements.
