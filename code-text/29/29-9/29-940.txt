   pediatric palliative care and hospice (PPCH) providers providing pediatric
   hospice services under the District of Columbia Medicaid Program.

   940.2. Pediatric palliative and hospice care is an organized program for
   delivering care to children with life-threatening conditions. This care
   focuses on enhancing quality of life for the child and family, minimizing
   suffering, optimizing functions, and providing opportunities for personal
   growth.

   940.3. An individual shall be eligible to receive PPCH services when he/she
   is:
   
   
   
   	(a)	Under the age of twenty one (21);
   
   
   
   (b)	Eligible for Medicaid; and

   940.4. The hospice shall obtain the certification that a beneficiary is
   terminally ill in accordance with the following procedures:

   written certification statements signed by:

   The individual’s attending physician, specialty care, or primary care
   physician.
   
   
   
   (b)      	For the second ninety (90) day period, the hospice shall obtain, no
   later than two (2) calendar days after the beginning of the second election
   period, written certification prepared by the hospice medical director or the
   beneficiary’s attending physician, specialty care, or primary care
   physician.
   
   
   
   (c)	For any subsequent election period of sixty (60) days or one or more
   thirty (30) day extended election periods, the hospice shall obtain, no later
   than two (2) calendar days after the beginning of any subsequent election
   period,  written certification  prepared by the hospice medical director or
   the beneficiary’s attending physician, specialty care, or primary care
   physician.

   940.5. The certification required in § 940.4 shall include:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   A statement that the beneficiary’s life expectancy is six (6) months or
   less; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The signature of any physician required in § 940.4 to certify the terminal
   illness.

   940.6. Each beneficiary who elects hospice care shall file an election
   statement with a participating provider entity.

   940.7. A parent or legally authorized guardian shall file the election
   statement for beneficiaries under the age of eighteen (18). Beneficiaries
   eighteen (18) years of age and over may file the election statement on their
   own or by a legally authorized representative.

   940.8. If the beneficiary electing hospice lacks the mental capacity to make
   an election, the designated representative shall file the election statement
   pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Health Care Decisions Act of
   1988, effective March 16, 1989 (D.C. Law 7-189; D.C. Official Code §  21-2201
   et seq).

   940.9. An election statement shall include:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Identification of the particular PPCH provider that will provide care to the
   beneficiary;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   An acknowledgement by the beneficiary or their representative that the
   beneficiary has been given a full explanation of the palliative rather than
   curative nature of hospice care as it relates to the beneficiary’s terminal
   illness;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   An acknowledgement by the beneficiary or their representative that the
   beneficiary understands that an election to receive hospice care is a waiver
   of the Medicaid services described in  § 940.13;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The effective date of the election to receive hospice care; and

   940.10. The initial election period shall be for ninety (90) days, followed by
   a second ninety (90) day election period. Subsequent election periods shall be
   for sixty (60) days or one or more thirty (30) day election periods.

   940.11. An election to receive PPCH is considered to continue through the
   initial election period and through any subsequent election periods without a
   break in care as long as the beneficiary remains in the care of the PPCH
   provider and does not revoke the election.

   940.12. A beneficiary or their representative may revoke the hospice election
   by signing and dating a revocation statement. This shall not prohibit a
   beneficiary from reelecting PPCH services at a later date.

   940.13. The beneficiary shall waive all rights to Medicaid coverage for the
   following services for the duration of the election to receive hospice care:

   designated by the beneficiary; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Any services equivalent to or duplicative of hospice care pursuant to 42 USC
   1395(d)(2)(A)).

   940.14. An election to receive PPCH services shall not constitute a waiver of
   rights to receive concurrent treatment services for the condition by which the
   beneficiary became terminally ill.

   care developed by a pediatric interdisciplinary team in accordance with §
