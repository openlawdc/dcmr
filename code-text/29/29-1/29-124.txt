   124.12 	(a)	If the eligible individual’s required financial contribution is
   equal
   
   	to or greater than the entire cost of services, he or she will be financially
   	responsible for the entire cost of services that are subject to the financial
   	needs test. The Rehabilitation Services Administration shall not be
   	responsible for the cost of any services subject to the financial need test,
   if 	an eligible individual’s contribution is equal to or greater than the
   entire 	cost of services.
   
   
   
   (b)	Pursuant to 34 C.F.R. § 361.46(a) and Section 111 of this Chapter, the

   not pay for vocational rehabilitation or independent living services subject
   to the financial need test, unless the eligible individual and a qualified
   vocational rehabilitation counselor employed by the Rehabilitation Services
   Administration signs and dates the IPE or ILP.  Failure to timely execute an
   IPE or ILP that includes services subject to the financial need test may delay
   the provision of those services or constitute cause to only provide services
   under Section 124.7 (services not subject to financial need) of this Chapter.
   
   
   
   124.13 	The Rehabilitation Services Administration shall deny authorization of
   a specific service to an eligible individual, when it has been determined that
   the consumer’s financial participation is required and he or she refuses to
   participate or fails to do so.  Other services that are not subject to the
   financial need test and do not require the eligible individual’s financial
   participation under this Section may continue to be authorized if the IPE
   remains viable without the provision of the service(s) that was denied.
   
   
   
   124.14 	An eligible individual who is receiving services under an IPE or ILP
   before the effective date of this section shall continue to be served in
   accordance with his or her IPE or ILP, and shall not be subject to the
   financial need test unless:(a) 	The vocational goal identified in the IPE, or
   the independent living
   
   goal identified in the ILP, is achieved;
   
   
   
   (b) 	The eligible individual&#8217;s record of service is closed pursuant to
   this Chapter; or
   
   (c) 	The individual&#8217;s IPE or ILP is amended, in accordance with Section
   110 of this Chapter 	and 34 C.F.R. § 361.45 (d).
