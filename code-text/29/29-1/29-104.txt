PROCEDURES FOR INELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION (ยง 29-104)

104.1. If the Rehabilitation Services Administration determines that an
   applicant is ineligible for vocational rehabilitation services or determines
   that an individual receiving services under an individualized plan for
   employment that is developed pursuant to sections 110 and 111 of this chapter
   is no longer eligible for services, the Rehabilitation Services Administration
   shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	Make the ineligibility determination only after providing an opportunity
   for full consultation with the individual or, as appropriate, with the
   individual&#8217;s representative;
   
   
   
   (b)	Inform the individual in writing, supplemented as necessary by other
   appropriate modes of communication consistent with the informed choice of the
   individual, of the ineligibility determination, including:
   
   
   
   (1)	The reasons for that determination,
   
   
   
   (2)	The requirements under this section, and
   
   
   
   (3)	The means by which the individual may express and seek remedy for any
   dissatisfaction, including the procedures for review of determinations in
   accordance with sections 135 through 169;
   
   
   
   (c)	Provide the individual with a description of services available from a
   Client Assistance Program established under 34 C.F.R. Part 370 and information
   on how to contact that program;
   
   
   
   (d)	Refer the individual to:
   
   
   
   (1)	Other programs that are part of the One-Stop service delivery system under
   the Workforce Investment Act that can address the individual&#8217;s training
   or employment-related needs; or
   
   
   
   (2)	Local extended employment providers if the ineligibility determination is
   based on a finding that the individual is incapable of achieving an employment
   outcome as defined in section 199; and
   
   
   
   (e)	Review within twelve (12) months and annually thereafter if requested by
   the individual or, if appropriate, by the individual&#8217;s representative,
   any ineligibility determination that is based on a finding that the individual
   is incapable of achieving an employment outcome. This review need not be
   conducted in situations in which the individual has refused it, the individual
   is no longer present in the District of Columbia, the individual&#8217;s
   whereabouts are unknown, or the individual&#8217;s medical condition is
   rapidly progressive or terminal.
