                                  DC REGULATIONS

MEDIATION PROCESS FOR BLIND VENDORS AND RSVFP TRAINEES RECEIVING VOCATIONAL
REHABILITATION SERVICES (§ 29-223)

223.1. The Administration provides vendors or RSVFP trainees the voluntary
   option to request mediation, a formal dispute resolution process mandated by
   34 C.F.R. § 361.57.  Mediation is available whenever there is a dispute about
   vocational rehabilitation services pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,
   and 34 C.F.R. § 395.11. Mediation is facilitated by an impartial qualified
   mediator and relies upon the good faith efforts of all interested parties to
   communicate in a productive manner to reach a collaborative agreement as to
   how the dispute should be resolved.

   223.2. Mediation does not involve findings of facts or the weighing of
   evidence, similar to a formal, impartial due process hearing. Mediation is a
   voluntary process and does not affect the vendor’s/RSVFP trainee’s right
   to request an impartial due process hearing.  In the event mediation is
   concluded without a resolution, detailed in a written mediation agreement,
   either party may pursue resolution through an impartial due process hearing.
