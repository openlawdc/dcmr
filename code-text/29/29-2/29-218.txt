DUE PROCESS SCOPE AND PROCEDURES FOR BLIND VENDORS AND RSVFP TRAINEES RECEIVING
VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION SERVICES (§ 29-218)

218.1. The purpose of these regulations is to establish procedures pursuant to
   the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and 34 C.F.R. § 395.11, which
   provide vendors and/or RSVFP trainees the opportunity to resolve disagreements
   with any determination concerning the furnishing or denial of vocational
   rehabilitation services offered in connection with the Randolph-Sheppard
   Vending Facility Program (RSVFP).
   
   
   
   218.2 	(a)	A Vendor or RSVFP trainee who is dissatisfied with any
   determination concerning the furnishing or denial of vocational rehabilitation
   services or training, provided under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and/or 34
   C.F.R. § 395.11, has the right to pursue any or all of the following options
   provided in 34 C.F.R. § 361.57:
   
   
   
   (1)	Informal administrative review meeting with the Chief of the Division of
   Services for the Blind (DSB);
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Mediation; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Impartial due process hearing before the D.C. Office of
   
   Administrative Hearings.

   218.3. A service determination dispute regarding vocational rehabilitation
   services may be resolved at any level within the appeals process.  The appeal
   process is initiated when a vendor or RSVFP trainee requests an informal
   administrative review meeting. However, a vendor or RSVFP trainee is not
   precluded from beginning his or her appeal by requesting mediation or
   requesting an impartial due process hearing, as a means to resolve a
   determination that affects the provision of vocational rehabilitation
   services.
