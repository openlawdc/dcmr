6031.1. If, as a result of an investigation undertaken pursuant to § 6024, or
   through any other means, CFSA finds evidence of gross incompetence, misconduct
   in operating the foster home, supported neglect or abuse of children, or any
   other condition that poses an immediate threat to the health or safety of

   (b)	Remove any foster child who remains in the foster home; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Begin steps to revoke the license.

   6031.2. If, as a result of an investigation undertaken pursuant to § 6024, or
   through any other means, CFSA finds evidence of any condition that may pose a

   immediately suspend a license for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days.

   6031.3. CFSA may extend the suspension period under § 6030.2 for no more than

   notify a foster parent of its intent to suspend the license if the condition
   is not remedied by a specific date not to exceed thirty (30) days. If the
   condition is not remedied by the date, CFSA may suspend the license pursuant
   to § 6030.2, but may not extend the suspension period in accordance with §
   6030.3.

   6031.5. Except for a suspension under § 6030.1, by the end of the suspension
   period, CFSA shall:

   immediately.

   6031.7. If a license is suspended:
   
   
   
   (a)	No agency may place any child in the foster home; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Each foster child shall be removed from the home by the end of the
   suspension period if the condition is not remedied.

   6031.8. In the event of a planned revocation or suspension, at least ten (10)
   business days before the planned date, CFSA shall send the foster parent a
   notice of intended action that includes:
   
   
   
   (a)	The intended action;

   (c)	A statement describing the foster parent&#8217;s right to appeal.

   6031.9. Within five (5) business days after the suspension or revocation of a
   license, CFSA shall send the foster parent a notice that includes:
   
   
   
   (a)	The action;
   
   
   
   (b)	A statement of the specific rule violated; and
   
   
   
   (c)	A statement describing the foster parent&#8217;s right to appeal.

   6031.10. Unless CFSA has removed a foster child from the foster home pursuant
   to §§ 6024 or 6030.1 and if the revocation is a planned revocation, CFSA
   shall immediately remove each foster child from a foster home when a license

   pursuant to § 6030.8 and the foster parent filed an appeal within ten (10)
   days of the notice.

   6031.11. Once suspended or revoked, a license may not be restored, a foster
   home license may not be renewed, and foster children may not be placed in the
