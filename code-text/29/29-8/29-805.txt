RECORDS (ยง 29-805)

805.1. In order to ensure that the treatment provided and paid for with
   Medicaid funds is of the highest quality and fully meets all standards for
   Medicaid reimbursement, each participating FSMHC shall maintain Medicaid
   patient records and individualized treatment plans in a manner that will
   render them amenable to audit and review by authorized federal, state, and DHS
   mental health and Medicaid personnel.

   805.2. The requirements of ยง805.1 shall not infringe upon any protections of
   the law regarding confidentiality, but shall ensure mandated access to the
   necessary records as provided for in both federal and District law.

   805.3. The participating FSMHC shall maintain, and make available upon request
   by authorized federal and local Medicaid personnel, complete financial records
   covering its operations. Federal regulations governing Medicaid reimbursement
   require audits and reviews to support reimbursements.

   805.4. All required financial records and information shall be maintained for
   a period of at least three (3) years following the date of treatment for which
   Medicaid was billed, or until an audit has been completed, whichever comes
   first.

   805.5. All medical records shall be retained in accordance with D.C. law.
