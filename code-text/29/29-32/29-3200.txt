3200.1. Effective October 1, 1990, no nursing facility in the District of
   Columbia that participates in the D.C. Medicaid Program or in Medicare shall
   use any individual working in the facility as a nurse aide for more than four
   (4) months, on a full-time, temporary, per diem, or other basis, unless that
   individual is competent to provide nursing and nursing related services, and
   has completed the District&#8217;s approved training and competency evaluation
   program, or the District&#8217;s approved competency evaluation program.

   3200.2. An individual employed as a nurse aide in a nursing facility prior to
   the effective date of this rule shall qualify as a credentialed nurse aide if
   he or she has successfully completed the District&#8217;s competency
   evaluation program only.

   3200.3. A person may be deemed competent for purposes of qualifying as a
   credentialed nurse aide in the District of Columbia if he or she is
   credentialed in another state based on the successful completion of the nurse
   aide competency evaluation program of that state which has been approved by
   the District of Columbia.

   3200.4. If a person has qualified as a credentialed nurse aide in another
   state but that state&#8217;s process does not require successful completion of
   a competency evaluation program approved by the District of Columbia, the
   person may become credentialed in the District by successfully completing the
   District&#8217;s competency evaluation program.

   3200.5. When an individual has not performed paid nursing or nursing related
   services in a nursing facility for a continuous period of twenty four (24)
   consecutive months since the most recent completion of a state approved
   training or competency evaluation program, the nursing facility shall require
   the individual to complete a new training and competency evaluation program
   within four (4) months of the first day of employment in the facility.
