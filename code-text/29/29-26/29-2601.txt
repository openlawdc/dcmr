APPLICATION PROCESS (ยง 29-2601)

2601.1. Each applicant for burial assistance shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	Submit a written application on a Department &#8220;Burial Assistance
   Application&#8221; form and be signed by a relative, preferably the next of
   kin; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Establish that the deceased person is the person for whom assistance is
   being sought.

   2601.2. The body of a deceased person shall not have been released to a
   funeral home that is not under contract with the District to receive funds
   from the Program at the time of the request for assistance. If the body of the
   deceased person is released to a contracted funeral home, the request for
   assistance must be made prior to receipt of burial or cremation services.

   2601.3. An authorized representative may apply on behalf of the applicant, if
   the applicant provides a written statement stating why he or she cannot attend
   an interview in person and provides the name and address of the person
   authorized to act on the applicant&#8217;s behalf.

   2601.4. An authorized representative shall be at least eighteen (18) years of
   age and have sufficient knowledge of the circumstances of the death to provide
   the requisite information, or be a person with legal authorization to act on
   behalf of the applicant.

   2601.5. Each applicant shall be interviewed on the date burial assistance is
   requested or, if that is not possible, on the following business day.

   2601.6. Each applicant shall cooperate fully in establishing the
   deceased&#8217;s eligibility. This shall include, but not be limited to,
   providing documentation or collateral proof of:
   
   
   
   (a)	Household composition;
   
   
   
   (b)	Income and assets; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The cost of the funeral.

   2601.7. The Department shall provide the applicant with a written request
   specifying the information needed to complete the application and discuss with
   the applicant how to obtain the information. The application shall be
   considered complete when all requested information is furnished to the
   Department.

   2601.8. The Department shall not request that documentation be provided when
   it can obtain the information more easily than the person applying for burial
   assistance, if that determination can be made. The Department may use
   documents, telephone conversations, personal, collateral sources, reports,
   correspondence, and conferences to verify the information.

   2601.9. If the burial is expected to occur within two (2) business days of the
   date of submission of the completed application, the Department shall take all
   reasonable steps to process the application timely.

   2601.10. An application shall be considered abandoned if the applicant has not
   submitted the required information or contacted the assigned Department worker
   or supervisor within fourteen (14) days of the initial application.

   2601.11. An application shall not be denied if the applicant is attempting to
   obtain and furnish the required information, and has informed the Department
   accordingly.

   2601.12. The Department shall give each applicant, whose application has been
   denied, a clear concise written statement of the reasons for the denial within
   three (3) business days of the denial. Each written notice shall also inform
   the applicant of the right to an administrative review and fair hearing to
   contest the denial, and the steps the applicant shall take to seek review.
