                                  DC REGULATIONS

ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING (ยง 29-8104)

8104.1. Regardless of whether the obligor or joint account holder has sought
   an agency review of the Writ of Attachment, the obligor or joint account
   holder may object to the seizure of the funds by requesting an administrative
   hearing from the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). Grounds for
   requesting an administrative hearing shall be the same as the grounds for
   contesting the Writ of Attachment under ยง 8103.5.

   8104.2. CSSD shall provide the obligor and joint account holder, if
   applicable, with notice of his or her right to an administrative hearing when
   CSSD sends the obligor and joint account holder a copy of the Order of
   Condemnation.

   8104.3. The obligor or joint account holder shall request the administrative
   hearing in writing, either by mailing, faxing or bringing the written request
   to OAH.  The hearing request must be received by OAH within thirty (30)
   calendar days after the date of the Order of Condemnation sent to the obligor
   or joint account holder.

   8104.4. If the obligor or joint account holder does not request an
   administrative hearing from OAH, CSSD shall distribute the funds seized from
   the financial institution to the obligee at the conclusion of the thirty (30)
   calendar day period for requesting a hearing. If the obligor requests an
   administrative hearing, CSSD shall retain the funds seized until a decision is
   rendered by the administrative law judge. CSSD shall then either distribute
   the funds seized to the obligor and joint account holder or the obligee as
   required by the decision.
