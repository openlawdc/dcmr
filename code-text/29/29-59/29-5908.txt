                                  DC REGULATIONS

PRE-HEARING PROCEDURES (§ 29-5908)

5908.1. This section does not apply to an expedited preliminary review
   hearing.

   5908.2. CFSA shall notify the appellant in writing of the date, time, and
   place of the fair hearing. The notice shall be provided within ten (10)
   business days of the filing of the request for a fair hearing and at least ten
   (10) business days in advance of the fair hearing.

   5908.3. Except as provided by § 5907.11, the fair hearing shall be held
   within forty-five (45) days of the date of the fair hearing request, unless
   the time is extended for good cause.

   5908.4. The notice of fair hearing shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	Include a summary of or a copy of the rules governing the fair hearing
   process;
   
   
   
   (b)	Advise the appellant:
   
   
   
   (1)	Of his or her right to be represented by a lawyer or other person at the
   fair hearing, at the appellant&#8217;s own expense;
   
   
   
   (2)	Of the availability of any known free legal services;
   
   
   
   (3)	Of the right to present documents and witnesses, including CFSA employees,
   in support of the appeal;
   
   
   
   (4)	Of the right to examine the case record, except for information that CFSA
   is required by law to keep confidential;
   
   
   
   (5)	That if the appellant or a witness is deaf or cannot readily understand or
   communicate the spoken English language, the appellant may apply to CFSA for
   the appointment of a qualified interpreter;
   
   
   
   (6)	Of the name and telephone number of the person to call if the appellant
   cannot attend the fair hearing; and
   
   
   
   (7)	That failure to attend the fair hearing without good cause may result in
   dismissal of the appeal.

   5908.5. Any party may request a change of the date, time, or place of the fair
   hearing. If the Hearing Examiner finds that good cause for a change exists,
   CFSA shall set another date, time, or place for the fair hearing. The time
   limit established by § 5908.3 shall be extended by the period of delay due to
   any postponement approved by the Hearing Examiner.

   5908.6. CFSA may schedule a consolidated fair hearing involving multiple
   appellants when it receives more than one request for fair hearing and the
   sole issue is one of District or federal law or policy, or CFSA policy. In any
   consolidated fair hearing, the same procedures for an individual fair hearing
   apply, including the right of individual representation.

   5908.7. The appellant may request, in writing, assistance to secure the
   attendance at the fair hearing of any CFSA employee. The request shall state
   the reasons why the employee&#8217;s attendance is required. If the Hearing
   Examiner decides that the employee&#8217;s attendance is necessary for the
   fair determination of the issues on appeal, the Hearing Examiner shall require
   the employee, if still employed by CFSA, to be present at the fair hearing.

   5908.8. The Hearing Examiner may require the presence at the fair hearing of
   any CFSA employee, or in the case of an applicant for or holder of a foster
   home license, any child placing agency under which the applicant seeks to be
   licensed.

   5908.9. The appellant may examine the CFSA record upon which the CFSA action
   is based, except any information that CFSA is required by law to keep
   confidential.

   5908.10. The Hearing Examiner may require the parties to exchange documents
   and witness lists prior to the hearing.

   5908.11. The Hearing Examiner may, prior to the hearing date and with the
   consent of the parties, refer the matter to another CFSA Hearing Examiner for
   mediation. The time requirements in § 5908.3 shall be extended while the case
   is in mediation.

   5908.12. This section shall apply to a request for final fair hearing pursuant
   to § 5902.1(g) except that:
   
   
   
   (a)	The notice of the date, time, and place of the fair hearing shall be
   provided within five business days of the expedited preliminary review hearing
   or, if one is not requested, within five business days of receipt of the
   request for a final fair hearing; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The fair hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days after the
   suspension or conversion is issued, unless extended for no more than an
   additional thirty (30) days upon agreement of all parties or for good cause
   shown.
