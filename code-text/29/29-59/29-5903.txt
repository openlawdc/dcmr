REQUEST FOR FAIR HEARING (§ 29-5903)

5903.1. Except for a request for an expedited preliminary review as provided
   in § 5903.6, a person, or his or her representative, may request a fair
   hearing by giving a timely and clear expression, in writing, that he or she is
   appealing one or more of the decisions in § 5901.1. The request must be
   directed to the person specified by CFSA in its written notice under §
   5902.2(d).

   5903.2. A request for a fair hearing shall include a brief statement, with
   factual support if appropriate, asserting why the decision or proposed
   decision of CFSA is incorrect. If a request for a fair hearing is received
   without the statement required, CFSA may refuse to consider the request or
   require re-submission of the statement before it will consider the request.
   The date that the statement is received shall be considered to be the filing
   date of the request for a fair hearing.

   5903.3. If it is unclear from the request for a fair hearing what action is
   being appealed, CFSA may ask the person who filed the request to clarify the
   request. The date the clarification is received shall be considered to be the
   filing date of the request for a fair hearing.

   5903.4. Except for a request for an expedited preliminary review hearing as
   provided by § 5903.6, a request for a fair hearing must be received within
   thirty (30) days of
   
   
   
   (a)	The date of the timely notice of action or intended action;
   
   
   
   (b)	The date of the action, if CFSA failed to give timely notice; or
   
   
   
   (c)	The date by which CFSA was required to act and CFSA failed or refused to
   act.

   5903.5. CFSA shall acknowledge receipt of the request for fair hearing
   promptly and in writing.

   5903.6. The provisions of § 5903 shall apply to a request for an expedited
   preliminary review hearing under § 5907, except that:
   
   
   
   (a)	The request may be made orally or in writing; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The request must be received within seven (7) business days of the receipt
   of the notice of emergency suspension or revocation.
