   have been used in the efforts to locate the missing parent(s) and the results
   of their use:

   child-placing agency or petitioner shall make a good faith effort to obtain
   the information from the known parent. If the name of the unknown parent is

   shall file an affidavit outlining the known parent’s reason for refusing to
   give the information.

   1632.4. If the birth mother names two or more possible fathers, the
   child-placing agency shall attempt to locate all of the alleged fathers.
