SUPERVISION OF CHILDREN IN FOSTER HOMES (§ 29-1644)

1644.1. Each child-placing agency shall make efforts to maintain contact
   between the child and his or her family during the period of foster care and
   assist the family in preparing for the child’s return to the home unless it
   has been determined that adoption of the child by other than his or her own
   relatives is in his or her best interest or that the continued relationship
   with his or her own family is injurious to his or her emotional and social
   development.

   1644.2. The frequency of the child placing agency&#8217;s visits with
   child(ren) in foster homes shall be based upon the needs of the child and the
   type of foster home in which he or she is placed, but shall not be less
   frequent than once every three (3) months.

   1644.3. The child-placing agency shall be responsible for protecting the
   health and safety of a child in its care and shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	Designate a licensed physician to advise the agency concerning standards
   of medical care; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Obtain age appropriate health supervision for child(ren) in care to
   include at least annual medical and dental examinations. This supervision
   shall include emergency and routine medical care and correction of remedial
   medical problems of each child.
