   9203.2 	A Medicaid provider shall be subject to reimbursement recoupment or   
   reconciliation based on the Medicaid Provider Preventable Conditions Payment
   Adjustment Policy. A determination of overpayments and/or underpayments shall
   be based on one (1) or more of the following factors:
   
   
   
   
   
   Whether the procedure or diagnosis underlying the claim is a PPC;
   
   
   
   
   
   Whether the condition results in the assignment of a case to a DRG that has a
   higher payment when present as a secondary diagnosis;
   
   
   
   
   
   Whether the claim resulting from the service was priced correctly;
   
   
   
   
   
   Whether the provider properly coded the claim by using the present on
   admission (POA) indicator field; and
   
   
   
   
   
   Whether the claim duplicates a previously paid claim.
