FINAL PER DIEM RATE CALULATION (ยง 29-6508)

6508.1. Each nursing facility&#8217;s per diem rate effective January 1, 2006
   shall be the sum of (a), (b) and (c) as set forth below:
   
   
   
   (a)	the nursing and resident care base year cost per diem established pursuant
   to subsection 6505.6 adjusted for inflation to March 30, 2003 using the CMS
   Prospective Payment System Skilled Nursing Facility Input Price Index;
   
   
   
   (b)	the routine and support cost base year cost per diem established pursuant
   to subsection 6506.3, or subsection 6506.4 if applicable, adjusted for
   inflation to March 30, 2003 using the CMS Prospective Payment System Skilled
   Nursing Facility Input Price Index; and
   
   
   
   (c)	the capital related base year cost per diem established pursuant to
   section 6507 adjusted for inflation to March 30, 2003 using the CMS
   Prospective Payment System Skilled Nursing Facility Input Price Index. The
   inflation adjustment in this subsection shall not be applied to depreciation,
   amortization and interest on capital related expenditures.

   6508.2. Effective April 1, 2006 and every six months thereafter, the nursing
   and resident care costs per diem shall be re-calculated in accordance with
   section 6505. The per diem rates established for routine and support costs and
   capital-related costs established pursuant to subsection 6508.1 shall be
   carried forward until costs are rebased.

   6508.3. When necessary, each facility&#8217;s per diem rate will be reduced by
   the same percentage to maintain compliance with the Medicare upper payment
   limit requirement.

   6508.4. MAA may approve an adjustment to the facility&#8217;s per diem rate if
   the facility demonstrates that it incurred higher costs due to extraordinary
   circumstances beyond its control including but not limited to strikes, fire
   flood, earthquake, or similar unusual occurrences with substantial cost
   effects.

   6508.5. Each adjustment pursuant to subsection 6508.4 shall be made only to
   the extent the costs are reasonable, attributable to the circumstances
   specified, separately identified by the facility, and verified by MAA.
