6502.1. MAA shall classify each nursing facility operating in the District of
   Columbia and participating in the Medicaid Program into the following three
   (3) peer groups:
   
   
   
   (a)	Peer Group One &#8211; All freestanding nursing facilities, with the
   exception of facilities owned or operated by the District of Columbia
   government;
   
   
   
   (b)	Peer Group Two &#8211; All hospital-based nursing facilities; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Peer Group Three &#8211; All freestanding nursing facilities owned or
   operated by the District of Columbia government.

   6502.2. The ceiling for routine and support costs per diem for Peer Groups One
   and Two shall be the day-weighted median cost per diem for routine and support
   costs for all facilities in Peer Groups One and Two, which is calculated to be
   fifty dollars and fifty-three cents ($50.53).

   6502.3. The ceiling for routine and support costs per diem for Peer Group
   Three shall be the day-weighted median cost per diem for routine and support
   costs for all facilities in Peer Group Three, which is calculated to be sixty-
   two dollars and twelve cents ($62.12).

   6502.4. The ceiling for nursing and resident care costs per diem for Peer
   Group One shall be the day-weighted median case mix neutralized cost per diem
   for nursing and resident care costs for all facilities in Peer Group One,
   which is calculated to be seventy-four dollars and twelve cents ($74.12).

   6502.5. The ceiling for nursing and resident care costs per diem for Peer
   Group Three shall be the day-weighted median case mix neutralized cost per
   diem for nursing and resident care costs for all facilities in Peer Group
   Three, which is calculated to be eighty-four dollars and eighty-three cents
   ($84.83).

   6502.6. The ceiling for nursing and resident care costs per diem for Peer
   Group Two shall be the median case mix neutralized cost per diem for nursing
   and resident care costs for all facilities in Peer Group Two, which is
   calculated to be one hundred and fifty-five dollars and seventy-nine cents
   ($155.79).

   6502.7. If a peer group has an even number of nursing facilities or resident
   days, the median or day-weighted median peer group ceiling shall be the
   arithmetic mean of the costs of the two nursing facilities or two resident
   days holding the middle position in the peer group array.

   6502.8. Once nursing facilities have been classified into peer groups for
   purposes of establishing the medians and ceilings, the nursing facility costs
   for those facilities shall remain in that peer group until Medicaid rates are
   rebased.

   6502.9. If a nursing facility changes classification status, the facility
   shall be reassigned from the peer group used to establish the base year rates
   to the new peer group based on the revised certification status as of the
   beginning of the District&#8217;s subsequent fiscal year.
