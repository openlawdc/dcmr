                                  DC REGULATIONS

NURSING AND RESIDENT CARE COSTS PER DIEM CALCULATION (§ 29-6505)

6505.1. Each nursing facility’s allowable nursing and resident care costs
   shall be adjusted in accordance with Subsection 6501.4.

   6505.2. The total resident days shall be determined in accordance with
   Subsection 6512.2.

   6505.3. The amount calculated in Subsection 6505.1 shall be divided by the
   Total Facility Case Mix Index to establish case mix neutral costs.  This
   process is known as case mix neutralization.

   6505.4. For nursing and resident care costs other than those defined at
   Subsection 6501.7(g), the case mix neutral costs established in Subsection
   6505.3 shall be divided by the resident days calculated in accordance with
   Subsection 6512.2 to determine each nursing facility’s nursing and resident
   care cost per diem without physical, speech, and occupational therapy
   services. To this resulting per diem, shall be added the per diem for nursing
   and resident care costs defined in Subsection 6501.7(g). The per diem for
   physical, speech, and occupational therapy services shall be calculated by
   dividing such costs by total Medicaid resident days.  The resulting sum of the
   per diems shall comprise each nursing facility’s nursing and resident care
   cost per diem unadjusted for case mix.

   6505.5. The ceiling established in accordance with Subsections 6502.4 through
   6502.6 for nursing and resident care costs for each peer group shall be
   multiplied by 163 percent (163%).

   6505.6. The nursing and resident care cost per diem rate unadjusted for case
   mix shall be the lower of the facility-specific per diem calculated pursuant
   to Subsection 6505.4 or the adjusted ceiling relative to each nursing facility
   calculated in accordance with Subsection 6505.5.

   6505.7. Each nursing facility shall be entitled to an incentive payment of
   forty percent (40%) of the difference between the facility-specific per diem
   rate established in Subsection 6505.4 and the adjusted ceiling calculated in
   accordance with Subsection 6505.5, if the facility-specific per diem rate
   calculated in accordance with Subsection 6505.4 is lower than the adjusted
   ceiling relative to each nursing facility established pursuant to Subsection
   6505.5.

   6505.8. The nursing and resident care cost per diem adjusted for case mix
   shall be determined by multiplying the nursing and resident care cost per diem
   calculated in accordance with Subsection 6505.6, or if applicable, the nursing
   and resident care cost per diem adjusted for incentive, as set forth in
   Subsection 6505.7, by the Facility Medicaid Case Mix Index.

   6505.9. The Facility Medicaid Case Mix Index used to establish the rates at
   implementation shall be developed from resident assessment data taken from the
   time period beginning October 1, 2001, through September 30, 2002.

   6505.10. The nursing and resident care cost per diem shall be adjusted for
   case mix beginning April 1, 2006, and every six (6) months thereafter.  The
   data used to establish the Facility Medicaid Case Mix Index for the
   semi-annual adjustment shall be developed as follows:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   October 1 shall be the average of the preceding year fourth calendar quarter
   and first calendar quarter picture dates; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   April 1 shall be the average of the preceding year second calendar quarter and
   third calendar quarter picture dates.

   6505.11. DHCF shall substitute the Facility Medicaid Case Mix Index with the
   District-wide Medicaid Case Mix Index if there are no valid assessments for a
   nursing facility during a picture date.
