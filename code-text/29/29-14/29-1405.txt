                                  DC REGULATIONS

WAIVER OF RIGHT TO REIMBURSEMENT (§ 29-1405)

1405.1. The Corporation Counsel may waive, in whole or in part, enforcement of
   the District’s claim against a third party if enforcement in a particular
   case would not be cost effective or would result in undue hardship to the
   beneficiary, including any dependents or survivors of the actual recipient of
   health-care assistance.

   1405.2. If waiver is based on the avoidance of undue hardship, the Corporation
   Counsel may in addition void the legal subrogation or assignment effected
   pursuant to §1400.2.

   1405.3. In determining whether and to what extent reimbursement should be
   sought or awarded under the Health-Care Assistance Reimbursement Act of 1984,
   the Corporation Counsel shall give due consideration to the extent of the
   beneficiary’s injuries and his or her current and future needs, including
   the current and future needs of any dependents or survivors of the actual
   recipient of health-care assistance.
