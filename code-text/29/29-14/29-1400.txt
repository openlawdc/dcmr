RIGHT TO REIMBURSEMENT (ยง 29-1400)

1400.1. Whenever the District provides health-care assistance to a beneficiary
   who has suffered an injury or illness under circumstances that would have
   created a liability upon a third party had the beneficiary instead of the
   District incurred the expense of the health-care assistance, the District
   shall have an independent, direct cause of action against that third party for
   the unreimbursed value and/or cost of the health-care assistance provided.

   1400.2. As soon as the District begins providing health-care assistance to a
   beneficiary, it shall become subrogated to any right or claim that the
   beneficiary has against a third party for the care and treatment it has
   undertaken to provide or pay for as health-care assistance. Alternatively, or
   in addition to the legal subrogation effected under this subsection, the
   Department may require a beneficiary to execute a written assignment of that
   same right or claim.

   1400.3. In determining the unreimbursed value of health and health related
   care and treatment that the District undertakes to provide directly to a
   beneficiary, the Department shall refer directly to the agency or institution
   which rendered service to determine health or health-related cost for care and
   treatment.
