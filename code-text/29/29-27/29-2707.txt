2707.1. All new and refilled prescriptions that have been filled for Medicaid
   beneficiaries but not picked up from the pharmacy within fourteen (14) days
   from the date of fill shall be returned to stock by the provider. The claim
   shall be reversed by the pharmacy benefit manager.

   2707.2. The following standards shall be followed for prescriptions returned
   to stock due to lapse of the time requirements set forth in § 2702.1:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   All medications returned to stock shall have originated at the same pharmacy
   to assure chain of custody;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   A registered pharmacist shall assure that the medications have been stored in
   accordance with manufacturers’ recommendations and current United States
   Pharmacopeia USP standards compendia;
   
   
   
   (c)   	Medications that have been reconstituted or compounded shall not be
   returned to stock but appropriately disposed of according to store policy; and
   
   
   
   (d)	A licensed pharmacist shall confirm that all controlled substance
   prescriptions are returned to stock to minimize opportunities for tampering
   and diversion.

   2707.3. Failure to reverse Medicaid prescription claims when such
   prescriptions are returned to stock may result in fraudulent and negligent
   health care billing.  DHCF may at any time audit pharmacies to monitor such
   activity and seek repayment of any overpayment to provider pharmacies.
