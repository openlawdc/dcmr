                                  DC REGULATIONS

THREE (3) DAY TEMPORARY SUPPLY (§ 29-2705)

2705.1. If the prescription claim is rejected by Medicaid, due to a Prior
   Authorization requirement, and is otherwise valid, the provider shall provide
   the beneficiary with a three (3) day temporary supply, unless one (1) of the
   following exceptions to the three (3) day supply rule is present:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The attempt to refill is too early;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The rejection is due to an error that only the provider can correct;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   There are clinical issues that must be resolved;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The prescription is for a barbiturate;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The prescription is for a benzodiazepine;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The prescription is for a maintenance narcotic medication;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The individual is not eligible for Medicaid; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   There would be a medical danger, in the provider’s judgment, if a temporary
   supply is dispensed.

   2705.2. If the beneficiary is presenting a new prescription, the provider may
   use discretion to determine whether there is a potential emergency to warrant
   a three (3) day supply.

   2705.3. Providers shall not ask beneficiaries to pay for the three (3) day
   supply.

   2705.4. Providers shall be reimbursed for the three (3) day supply and the
   standard dispensing fee by the Medicaid Program.

   2705.5. Beneficiaries who are denied a three (3) day supply of medicine may
   contact the call center operated by DHCF’s pharmacy benefit manager or
   request a hearing by contacting the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) or
   the Office of the Health Care Ombudsman if they believe their request for
   medication has been wrongfully denied, reduced, or not acted upon promptly.
