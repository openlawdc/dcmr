                                  DC REGULATIONS

PROCEDURES FOR FINDING GOOD CAUSE (§ 29-1713)

1713.1. CSED shall make a determination whether good cause exists no later
   than one hundred and eighty (180) days from the day that an applicant or
   recipient makes such a claim.

   1713.2. CSED may make a determination after the one hundred and eighty (180)
   day period only if one (1) of the following occurs:
   
   
   
   (a)	The agency needs additional time because the information required to
   verify the claim cannot be obtained within one hundred and eighty (180) days;
   or
   
   
   
   (b)	The claimant did not provide substantiating evidence within the period
   required by §1712.1 and 1712.2.

   1713.3. Until CSED makes a finding concerning an applicant’s or
   recipient’s good cause claim, the applicant’s or recipient’s eligibility
   for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) shall be determined without
   regard to child support cooperation, provided that:
   
   
   
   (a)	The applicant or recipient asserted and made timely substantiation of the
   good cause claim; and
   
   
   
   (b)	CSED has failed to determine whether good cause exists within the time
   period permitted to process a TANF application or redetermination.

   1713.4. CSED may further verify a good cause claim if the applicant’s or
   recipient’s statement of the claim, together with the substantiating
   evidence, do not provide a sufficient basis for finding good cause. CSED shall
   not contact the non-custodial parent or obligor from whom support would be
   sought, without first:
   
   
   
   (a)	Obtaining prior approval from the applicant or recipient;
   
   
   
   (b)	Permitting the applicant or recipient to provide additional substantiating
   evidence that would make the contact unnecessary;
   
   
   
   (c)	Permitting the applicant or recipient to withdraw the application for
   assistance or have the case closed; or
   
   
   
   (d)	Permitting the applicant or recipient to have the good cause claim denied.

   1713.5. CSED shall determine whether to find good cause for noncooperation
   based upon:
   
   
   
   (a)	The content and credibility of the statement of the applicant or
   recipient;
   
   
   
   (b)	The content and credibility of all substantiating evidence; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Any further verification by CSED.

   1713.6. A determination concerning good cause shall be reviewed for approval
   by CSED supervisory personnel, and the findings will be recorded in the case
   record(s).

   1713.7. If the applicant or recipient fails to meet the requirements set forth
   in §1710.1 of this chapter, CSED shall determine that good cause does not
   exist.
