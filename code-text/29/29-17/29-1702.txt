   than, or in addition to, income withholding.

   1702.2. When assistance has been requested, or when a case is being enforced
   under Part D of Title 4 of the Social Security Act, and the Department
   identifies real or personal property of a responsible relative upon which a
   lien may be asserted, it shall refer the matter to the Office of the
   Corporation Counsel for review and appropriate action.

   1702.3. In every support case in which assistance is requested or which is
   being enforced under Part D of Title 4 of the Social Security Act, the
   Department shall, in addition to using other available means, refer the matter
   to the Department of Finance and Revenue for interception of the income tax
   refund of individuals who owe overdue support.
