                                  DC REGULATIONS

CONSEQUENCES OF A FINDING THAT GOOD CAUSE EXISTS (§ 29-1714)

1714.1. If CSED determines that the applicant or recipient has good cause for
   non-cooperation, CSED shall suspend action on the applicant’s or
   recipient’s paternity or child support case until the applicant or recipient
   requests resumption, or until CSED determines that good cause no longer
   exists, whichever is sooner.

   1714.2. If an applicant or recipient is determined to have good cause for
   refusal to cooperate, CSED shall ask the applicant or recipient once every
   twelve (12) months whether his or her situation has changed in a manner that
   would make establishment of paternity or establishment and enforcement of
   child support or medical support, pursuant to the safeguards of §1709.3, safe
   and appropriate.
