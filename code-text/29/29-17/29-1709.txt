1709.1. Good cause for an applicant’s or a recipient’s refusal to
   cooperate, as required by §1707 of this chapter shall be found to exist if:
   
   
   
   (a)	Efforts to cooperate are reasonably anticipated to result in physical,
   sexual, or emotional harm to:
   
   
   
   (1)	The child with respect to whom assistance is claimed;
   
   
   
   (2)	The applicant or recipient;
   
   
   
   (3)	A household member of the applicant or recipient; or
   
   
   
   (4)	An immediate family member of the applicant or recipient, defined as a
   spouse, parent, sibling or child; or
   
   
   
   (b)	CSED identifies circumstances that would make cooperation, or actions
   resulting directly from cooperation, detrimental to the child with respect to
   whom assistance is claimed including, but not limited to, one (1) of the
   following:
   
   
   
   (1)	The child was conceived as a result of incest or sexual assault (a
   conviction for incest or sexual assault is not necessary for this subparagraph
   to apply);
   
   
   
   (2)	Legal proceedings for the adoption of the child are pending before a court
   of competent jurisdiction; or
   
   
   
   (3)	The applicant or recipient is currently being assisted by a public or
   licensed private social agency to resolve the issue of whether to keep the
   child or relinquish the child for adoption.

   1709.2. The determination of whether good cause for noncooperation exists
   shall be made consistent with the best interests of the child on whose behalf
   assistance is claimed which includes minimizing the child’s exposure to
   family violence.
   
   
   
   1709.3 	In any case in which an applicant or recipient is at risk of harm, but
   wishes to establish paternity for a child on whose behalf assistance is
   claimed or to pursue child support and/or medical support, CSED shall use
   procedures to safeguard the address of the applicant, recipient, or child.
