EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE &#8211; RENT ARREARAGES (ยง 29-7506)

7506.1. Assistance may be authorized to pay a rent arrearage, late fee and
   associated court fees if each of the following conditions are met:
   
   
   
   (a)	Eviction is imminent and documented by a Landlord and Tenant Court summons
   or referral, Writ of Restitution, Notice to Vacate, or correspondence from the
   landlord or his or her agent documenting that the applicant is a tenant and
   has a current rent arrearage of at least 30 days past due;
   
   
   
   (b)	The arrearage must be that of the applicant. If the lease or rental
   agreement is not in the applicant&#8217;s name, he or she must provide
   documentation that he or she is responsible for the arrearage. Both the
   applicant and the landlord must agree to change the lease to the
   applicant&#8217;s name;
   
   
   
   (c)	Arrearage for any period caused by a rent strike may be paid only if any
   escrow money is first applied to the arrearage and the applicant agrees to
   resume regular payment of rent;
   
   
   
   (d)	The arrearage that will be paid with Emergency Rental Assistance funds may
   not exceed five (5) months; and
   
   
   
   (e)	The total assistance payment (including rent arrearage, late fee and any
   associated court fees) may not exceed four thousand two hundred fifty dollars
   ($4,250).

   7506.2. Notwithstanding the requirements in section 7506.1, certain
   requirements may be waived with respect to the total maximum payment and the
   number of months of the arrearage which may be paid for with emergency rental
   assistance funds, if extraordinary circumstances exist.

   7506.3. The requirements in section 7506.1 may be waived up to the maximums
   specified in section 7506.4, if one (1) or more of the following mitigating
   factors is determined to exist:
   
   
   
   (a)	The household consists of seven (7) or more members and reasonable
   alternatives to the existing housing arrangement are not available; or
   
   
   
   (b)	A member of the household has a physical or mental disability, a medically
   documented incapacity or extended illness to the extent that loss of existing
   housing would pose a serious threat to the health or safety of the family
   member.

   7506.4. If the requirements specified in section 7506.3 are met:
   
   
   
   (a)	The total maximum emergency rental assistance payment may be increased
   from four thousand two hundred fifty dollars ($4,250) to six thousand dollars
   ($6,000); and
   
   
   
   (b)	The arrearage that may be paid with emergency rental assistance funds may
   exceed five (5) months, if the total amount does not exceed the total maximum
   amount specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection.
