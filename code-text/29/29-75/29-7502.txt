7502.1. The applicant unit shall be composed of each individual who lives in
   the same household and whose needs, assets, and income are combined to
   determine eligibility.

   (a)	Persons related by full or half blood;
   
   
   
   (b)	Persons related by legal adoption;
   
   
   
   (c)	Persons related by marriage, including stepchildren and unmarried parents
   of a common child who live together; or
   
   
   
   (d)	Persons with legal responsibility for an unrelated minor child, or an
   unrelated adult with a disability.

   7502.3. A person temporarily away from home due to employment,
   hospitalization, vacation, or a visit shall be considered to be living in the

   holidays and during the summer vacations.

   applicant unit&#8217;s prorated share of the amount necessary to resolve the
   crisis.

   7502.6. The name of a non-household member on a rental lease shall have no
   effect on eligibility, except that:
   
   
   
   (a)	The applicant shall document that he or she is responsible for the
   payment; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Both the applicant and the landlord shall agree to change the lease to
   reflect only the applicant&#8217;s name.
