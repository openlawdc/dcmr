COMPUTATION OF PAYMENT (ยง 29-7504)

7504.1. The amount of assistance an eligible applicant may receive is based on
   the following factors:
   
   
   
   (a)	The amount necessary to resolve the emergency;
   
   
   
   (b)	The applicant unit&#8217;s existing liquid assets;
   
   
   
   (c)	The applicant unit&#8217;s income expected to be received in the thirty
   (30) days following the date of application;
   
   
   
   (d)	The applicant unit&#8217;s anticipated expenses for basic necessities and
   fixed monthly payments, except for child support payments the income for which
   is excluded under section 7503.9(k), in the thirty (30) days following the
   date of application;
   
   
   
   (e)	The willingness of the landlord to accept partial payment from the
   provider, and the remainder from the applicant within thirty (30) days after
   the first payment; and
   
   
   
   (f)	The applicable maximum allowable payment as provided in these rules.

   7504.2. The following sequential calculation shall be used to determine the
   amount of emergency rental assistance:
   
   
   
   (a)	The applicant unit&#8217;s income certain to be received within thirty
   (30) days following the date of application shall be determined. If there is a
   live Writ of Restitution or the landlord will not accept partial payment, only
   the income certain to be received until the expected occurrence of the
   emergency shall be considered;
   
   
   
   (b)	The applicant unit&#8217;s anticipated expenses for basic necessities and
   fixed monthly expenses in the thirty (30) days following the date of
   application shall be determined;
   
   
   
   (c)	The anticipated expenses shall be subtracted from the anticipated income;
   
   
   
   (d)	Any surplus resulting from the calculation in paragraph (c) shall be added
   to any liquid assets to determine the applicant&#8217;s contribution; and
   
   
   
   (e)	The applicant&#8217;s contribution shall be subtracted from the amount
   necessary to resolve the emergency.

   7504.3. The emergency rental assistance payment shall be equal to the amount
   computed under section 7504.2, subject to the applicable maximum limits for
   emergency rental assistance as stated in these rules.
