                                  DC REGULATIONS

EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE &#8211; SECURITY OR DAMAGE DEPOSIT (ยง 29-7507)

7507.1. A security or damage deposit shall only be authorized if the landlord
   does not waive the deposit and one of the following circumstances is present:
   
   
   
   (a)	The applicant unit is or will become homeless if assistance is not
   provided; or
   
   
   
   (b)	The purpose of the assistance is to reunite a child less than eighteen
   (18) years of age with his or her family or prevent separation from his or her
   family. Prevention of family separation shall be broadly interpreted to
   include situations where the family is currently homeless or are residents of
   a family shelter facility, a family is forced to move to another dwelling due
   to overcrowded conditions, the condemned nature of the current housing, or the
   forced sale of the currently dwelling, and there are no other means, other
   than through the provision of this assistance, whereby new housing could be
   secured.

   7507.2. The maximum emergency assistance payment for a security or damage
   deposit shall be the actual amount of the deposit, which may not exceed more
   than the cost of one (1) month&#8217;s unsubsidized rent, as specified by the
   landlord up to nine hundred dollars ($900).

   7507.3. Any applicant coming directly from a transitional housing program that
   requires an escrow account for purposes of obtaining permanent housing, shall
   demonstrate why they do not have sufficient resources available for security
   deposit and first month&#8217;s rent.

   7507.4. The security or damage deposit payment shall be made directly to the
   landlord.

   7507.5. Where the emergency was a result of eviction or displacement from a
   residence in the District of Columbia, assistance under sections 7507 and 7508
   may be used for relocating to another jurisdiction within the greater
   Washington area as defined by the boundaries of the District of Columbia and
   its contiguous counties in the states of Maryland and Virginia.
