                                  DC REGULATIONS

TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION PROCEDURES (ยง 29-8214)

8214.1. If a grantee has materially failed to comply with the terms of a grant
   agreement, the Grant Officer may, after giving reasonable written notice to
   the grantee, do the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Suspend the grant in whole or in part;
   
   
   
   (b)	Terminate the grant for cause; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Take any other remedial action that may be legally available.

   8214.2. The notice of suspension shall state the reasons for the suspension,
   any corrective action required of the grantee, and the effective date.

   8214.3. The suspension may be made effective at once if a delayed effective
   date would be unreasonable considering the Grant Officer&#8217;s
   responsibilities to protect the District government&#8217;s interest.

   8214.4. The Grant Officer may reinstate a suspended grant if the grantee has
   taken corrective action satisfactory to the Grant Officer, or given
   satisfactory evidence that corrective action will be taken.

   8214.5. The Grant Officer may terminate the grant before the date of
   expiration if:
   
   
   
   (a)	The grantee has materially failed to comply with the terms of the grant
   agreement and appropriate corrective actions have not been taken during the
   period of suspension; or
   
   
   
   (b)	The failure to comply with the terms of the grant agreement is so serious
   that immediate termination is in the best interest of the District government.

   8214.6. The notice of termination shall state, in writing, the reasons for the
   termination, together with the effective date.

   8214.7. A grant may be terminated at the request of the grantee upon
   notification to the Grant Officer, in accordance with the provisions of the
   grant.
