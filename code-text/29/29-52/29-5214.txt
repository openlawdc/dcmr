                                  DC REGULATIONS

AUDITS AND REVIEWS (ยง 29-5214)

5214.1. MAA shall perform ongoing audits to ensure that Medicaid payments are
   consistent with efficiency, economy and quality of care, and made in
   accordance with federal and District rules governing Medicaid.

   5214.2. The audit process shall be conducted annually by MAA, to determine, by
   statistically valid scientific sampling, the appropriateness of services
   rendered and billed to Medicaid by DMH.

   5214.3. If MAA determines that claims are to be denied, MAA shall recoup, by
   the most expeditious means available, those monies erroneously paid to DMH for
   denied claims, following the period of Administrative Review set forth in
   subsection 5214.8 of these rules.

   5214.4. The recoupment amount for denied claims shall be determined by the
   following formula: A fraction shall be calculated with the numerator
   consisting of the number of denied claims from the audit sample. The
   denominator shall be the total number of paid claims from the audit sample.
   This fraction will be multiplied by the total dollars paid by Medicaid to DMH
   during the audit period, to determine the amount recouped. For example, if DMH
   received Medicaid reimbursement of ten thousand dollars ($ 10,000) during the
   audit period, and, during a review of the claims from the audited sample, it
   was determined that 10 claims out of 100 claims are denied, then ten percent
   (10%) of the amount reimbursed by Medicaid during the audit period, or one
   thousand dollars ($ 1000), would be recouped.

   5214.5. MAA shall issue a Notice of Recoupment (NR) to DMH, which sets forth
   the reasons for the recoupment, the amount to be recouped, and the procedures
   for requesting an Administrative Review.

   5214.6. DMH shall have sixty days from the date of the NR to submit a written
   request for Administrative Review of the NR. The request for Administrative
   Review of the NR shall be submitted to the Chief, Office of Program Integrity,
   Surveillance and Utilization Review Branch, Medical Assistance Administration,
   Department of Health.

   5214.7. The written request for Administrative Review shall include a
   description of the item to be reviewed, the reason for review of the item, the
   relief requested, and any documentation in support of the relief requested.

   5214.8. MAA shall mail a written determination relative to the Administrative
   Review not later than one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of the
   written request for Administrative Review under 5214.6.

   5214.9. Within forty five (45) days of receipt of the MAA&#8217;s written
   determination, DMH may appeal the written determination by filing a written
   notice of appeal with the Board of Appeals and Review.

   5214.10. Filing an appeal shall not stay any action to recover any
   overpayment.
