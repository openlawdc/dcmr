SUSPENSION FOR CONVICTION OF PROGRAM RELATED OFFENSE (ยง 29-1304)

1304.1. For the purposes of this section, the term &#8220;suspension&#8221;
   means that items or services furnished by a specified provider who has been
   convicted of a program related offense in a Federal, District of Columbia,
   State or local court shall not be reimbursed under Medicaid.

   1304.2. The Director shall, in accordance with 42 CFR 455.210, suspend from
   the District&#8217;s Medicaid Program any party who has been suspended from
   participation in Medicare for conviction of a program-related crime.

   1304.3. The Director shall suspend any convicted party who is not eligible to
   participate in Medicare whenever HCFA directs the Director to take the action.

   1304.4. Any suspension imposed by the Director under ยง1304.3 shall, at a
   minimum, be effective on the date and for the period specified by HCFA.

   1304.5. Except as authorized by federal regulations, reimbursement for
   services furnished directly or under the supervision of a suspended party
   shall not be made during the period of suspension.

   1304.6. Nothing in ยง1304.4 shall prevent the Director from imposing other
   sanctions against the provider under these rules.

   1304.7. If the Director proposes to terminate the provider agreement or to
   suspend the provider for a period of greater duration than that specified by
   HCFA, then prior to taking the action, the Director shall follow the
   procedures specified for exclusion and termination actions as set forth in
   ยง1303.

   1304.8. If the Director&#8217;s suspension is effective on the date and for
   the period specified by HCFA, then the convicted party shall be notified in
   writing by the Director regarding the effective date for the suspension.

   1304.9. The party shall not be entitled to a hearing under this chapter with
   regard to the suspension by HCFA. In this case, any right to appeal shall be
   provided by HCFA, not by the Director.
