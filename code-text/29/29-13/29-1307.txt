                                  DC REGULATIONS

SUSPENSION OF MEDICAID PAYMENTS FOR OVERPAYMENT-EVIDENCE AND NOTICE (ยง 29-1307)

1307.1. When the provider, pursuant to ยง1306, submits a statement, the
   Director shall consider the statement including any pertinent evidence
   submitted together with any other material bearing upon the case and shall
   make a determination as to whether the facts justify a suspension.

   1307.2. If the Director determines that a suspension shall go into effect, a
   written notice of the detemination shall be sent to the provider.

   1307.3. The notice shall contain specific findings on the conditions upon
   which the suspension was based and an explanatory statement for the final
   decision.

   1307.4. The suspension shall not take effect for at least fifteen (15) days
   following the date of the notice.

   1307.5. If the provider requests a hearing by filing a notice of appeal from
   the determination of suspension and overpayment with the D.C. Board of Appeals
   and Review within the fifteen (15) day period, the suspension shall not take
   effect until after a final decision is rendered following a hearing under
   these rules.

   1307.6. A request for a hearing to appeal the Director&#8217;s decision to
   suspend shall not stay the effectiveness of the suspension, if the Director
   determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that the provider will
   not refund overpayments other than through offset of program payments by
   suspension.

   1307.7. The Director&#8217;s implemention of a suspension, in whole or in
   part, does not in any way abrogate the right of the provider to file an appeal
   with the D.C. Board of Appeals and Review and to have a final decision
   rendered before final liability is established.

   1307.8. The provider has fifteen (15) days from the date of the notice sent,
   pursuant to ยง1307.4, to request a hearing by filing a notice of appeal.
