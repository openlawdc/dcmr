   shall notify the provider of his or her intention to suspend payments, in
   whole or in part, and the reasons for making the suspension.

   1306.2. If the reason for suspending payments is that the Director has

   aid in recovery, the notice to the provider under ยง1306.1 shall include the
   following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The factual basis for the determination of overpayments including the
   dollar value of the overpayment;
   
   
   
   (b)	How the overpayment was computed; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Specific reference to the particular sections of the statutes, rules,
   provider&#8217;s manual and/or provider&#8217;s agreement involved.

   1306.3. If the reason for the intended suspension is that the Director has
   reliable evidence that the provider has been overpaid, the notice to the
   provider shall include the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The reasons for making the suspension; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Any actions the Director intends to take to determine if any overpayment
   has been made.

   1306.4. Within thirty (30) days of the date in which the notice is sent to the
   provider under this section, the provider may submit documentary evidence and
   written argument against the proposed action.

   1306.5. For good cause shown, the Director may extend the thirty (30) day
   period.

   1306.6. If no statement is received from the provider within the thirty (30)
   day period or the additional thirty (30) day period specified in the notice,
   the suspension shall go into effect on the date after the end of the period.

   1306.7. The provisions of this section shall not apply when the Director,
   after furnishing a provider a written notice of the amount of the program
   reimbursement pursuant to ยง1309, suspends payment under that section.
