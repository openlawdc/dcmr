   other offenses related to participation in the Medicare or Medicaid Program
   which were not considered during the development of the exclusion; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Whether the State of local licensing authorities have taken any adverse
   action against the party for offenses related to participation in the Medicare
   or Medicaid Programs which were not considered during the development of the
   exclusion.

   1315.3. If the Director approves a request for reinstatement, he or she shall
   give written notice to the excluded, terminated or suspended party and to all
   others who were informed under ยง1312 specifying the date on which the
   Medicaid Program partipation shall resume.

   1315.4. If the Director does not approve the request for reinstatement, he or
