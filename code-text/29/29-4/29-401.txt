   federal funds under the Public Health Service Act; the Community Mental Health
   Centers Act; and the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention,
   Treatment and Rehabilitation Act of 1970 for grants, contracts, loans, or loan
   guarantees for the development and expansion, or support of health resources

   Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972.

   401.4. The SHPDA shall also review and approve or disapprove each proposed use
   of federal funds made available by the District government from an allotment
   contract or grant to the city under any of the Acts referred to in §401.2 for
   grants or contracts for the development, expansion, or support of health
   resources.

   401.5. Grants, contracts, loans, or loan guarantees made directly by the

   401.7. The SHPDA shall afford the SHCC a reasonable opportunity to review and
   comment on the approval or disapproval of proposed uses of those federal funds
   subject to review by the SHPDA and as specified in this section.

   401.8. The solicitation of SHCC comments on funds under §401.7 shall be
   consistent with the provisions of §419 of this chapter; Provided, that the

   as specified in §401.6.

   401.9. If questions arise respecting the reviewability of proposed uses of
   federal funds identified in §§401.1 through 401.3 and §401.6, either the
   applicant or the SHPDA may request the federal funding agency to determine
   whether any particular proposed use of federal funds is subject to review and
   approval or disapproval by the SHCC or SHPDA.

   401.10. In accordance with 42 CFR 122.404(c), if a federal funding agency
   concludes on its own initiative that a particular proposed use of federal
   funds in a program covered generally under §§401.1 through 401.3 and §401.6
   are not subject to review and approval or disapproval by the SHCC or SHPDA, it
   shall promptly notify the applicant and the SHPDA of that determination. In
   such cases, the SHPDA shall not conduct a review of the proposed uses of
   Federal funds.
