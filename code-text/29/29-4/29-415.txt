                                  DC REGULATIONS

REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (§ 29-415)

415.1. Upon the SHPDA&#8217;s receipt of an application, a preliminary review
   shall be made to determine whether additional information is needed to conduct
   a complete and reasonable review.

   415.2. SHPDA shall, whenever possible, rely on the application submitted to
   the federal funding agency for all information necessary to judge an
   application in relation to the general review criteria specified in §407 and
   any specific review criteria which may be adopted. However, because of the
   varying nature of the information requested by federal funding agencies, it
   may be necessary for the SHDPA to request additional information concerning
   the criteria directly from the applicant.

   415.3. The SHPDA may also request additional information to clarify unclear or
   incomplete information contained in the application.

   415.4. In the case of competing applications, SHPDA shall attempt to have
   comparable information from all applicants.

   415.5. If additional information is desired, the information necessary shall
   be specified in a letter within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of the
   application. The requested information shall be submitted to the SHPDA in the
   form and manner prescribed and published by the SHPDA. Unless otherwise
   prescribed and published, the information shall be submitted in letter form.
   No SHPDA application forms shall be required.

   415.6. Applicants shall reply to the request for additional information within
   fifteen (15) days from the receipt of the letter.

   415.7. Requests for additional information shall not extend the review period
   specified in §418.

   415.8. Failure to comply with requests for additional information or
   established time frames specified in §§415.1 and 415.2 may result in an
   incomplete review and possible subsequent disapproval of an application.
