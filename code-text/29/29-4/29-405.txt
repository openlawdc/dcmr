CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL (ยง 29-405)

405.1. In accordance with 42 CRF 122.408(b)(3), if an application contains
   material which the applicant believes to be confidential or proprietary (and
   which, therefore, should not become public), the applicant may submit a
   summary of this material to the federal funding agency.

   405.2. Upon determination by the federal funding agency that the material is
   confidential or proprietary and the summary is full and accurate, the SHPDA
   shall accept the summary with the other portions of the application, and shall
   omit any requirement for that portion of the application that has been
   summarized.
