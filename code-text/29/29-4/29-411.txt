411.1. In accordance with 42 CFR 122.405, when the proposed uses of federal
   funds would involve the development, expansion, or support of health resources
   in the District and another health service area in the Washington Metropolitan
   area, if the grant is to be administered from the District, the SHPDA shall
   coordinate the reviews by all of the health systems agencies involved, except
   as provided in ยง411.2.

   411.2. With the agreement of the delegated agency, SHPDA may delegate
   coordinating responsibility to the agency in whose health service area a major
   portion of the funds shall be used, or the SHPDA may be delegated the review
   authority by the other agencies involved.

   411.3. If some of the agencies involved approve the proposed use and some
   disapprove, the decision of each health systems agency shall apply to the use
   of funds in its respective health service area, as specified in 42 CFR
   122.405.

   411.4. The SHPDA is responsible for reviewing proposed uses of federal funds
   to the large number of national organizations headquartered within the

   administered in the District. Where a proposed use of federal funds involves
   the development, expansion, or support of health resources in areas outside
   the Washington D.C. area, contact shall be made with the appropriate health
   systems agency or state health planning and development agency for the
   delegation of the coordination of the review to the appropriate agency, in
   accordance with 42 CFR 122.405.
