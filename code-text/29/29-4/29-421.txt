CONSEQUENCES OF REVIEW DECISIONS (ยง 29-421)

421.1. SHCC or SHPDA approval shall not guarantee funding of an application,
   although under 42 CFR 122.415 no award of federal funds subject to review and
   approval shall be made unless one (1) of the following has occurred:
   
   
   
   (a)	The SHCC or SHPDA has approved the proposed use;
   
   
   
   (b)	The SHCC or SHPDA has failed to approve or disapprove a proposal after
   having been provided at least sixty (60) days in which to review and approve
   or disapprove the proposed use;
   
   
   
   (c)	In the case of funds made available in a contract, grant, or allotment to
   the District government, the Secretary of DHHS has overridden an SHCC or SHPDA
   disapproval in accordance with 42 CFR 122.415; or
   
   
   
   (d)	In the case of funds made available in a contract, grant, or allotment to
   the District government, the Mayor has overridden the SHPDA or SHCC
   disapproval in accordance with ยง1513(e)(3) of Public Law 93-641, as amended.

   421.2. In accordance with 42 CFR 122.415, if the SHPDA disapproves a proposed
   use of federal funds under one (1) of the four (4) Acts specified in ยง401.2,
   the Secretary of DHHS shall not make funds available unless the applicant
   requests the Secretary to review the disapproval decision, accompanied by a
   justification for approval by the Secretary of the proposed use of federal
   funds despite the SHCC disapproval, and the Secretary determines that the
   funds should be made available notwithstanding the SHPDA disapproval.

   421.3. As specified in 42 CFR 122.415(b)(1) and (b)(2), to be effective a
   request for the Secretary&#8217;s review shall be delivered or mailed to the
   appropriate federal funding agency not later than fifteen (15) days after the
   SHPDA provides notification to the applicant of the disapproval decision. This
   request shall be accompanied by a justification for approval by the Secretary
   of the proposed use of federal funds despite SHPDA disapproval, including
   detailed responses to the reasons given by the SHPDA for its disapproval.

   421.4. In accordance with 42 CFR 122.415(c)(1), within three (3) working days
   of the receipt by DHHS of an applicant&#8217;s request for the reconsideration
   of the SHPDA disapproval, the SHPDA shall be notified of the request and shall
   be asked to submit its comments within fifteen (15) calendar days from the
   delivery date (or the postmark date, if mailed) of the notification. The
   review official shall forward copies of the SHPDA notification to the
   applicant.

   421.5. In accordance with 42 CFR 122.415(d)(1), in determining whether to make
   funds available notwithstanding the SHPDA disapproval, the federal review
   official shall consider any comments received from the SHPDA, the appropriate
   federal bureau or institute director, and the Regional Health Administrator.
   In addition, the following criteria shall be considered:
   
   
   
   (a)	Whether the SHPDA substantially adhered to the applicable review
   procedures adopted by the Agency;
   
   
   
   (b)	Whether the proposed use of federal funds is consistent with the
   applicable review criteria used by the SHPDA;
   
   
   
   (c)	Whether the failure to make the proposed federal funds available will
   adversely affect the health of the residents who are to receive the services;
   and
   
   
   
   (d)	Whether the proposed uses of federal funds meet a national or regional
   need for which local conditions offer special advantages, and which is
   unlikely to be accomplished efficiently and effectively in another health
   service area.
