6103.1. A permanent guardianship subsidy may include:
   
   
   
   (a)	Short-term payments, which are time-limited and intended to meet the cost
   of integrating a child into the family; and

   income is limited and is likely to remain so.

   (b)	Based initially on the amount of the foster care board and care payment
   received by the applicant for the child&#8217;s care at the time that the
   application is approved; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Following a review held pursuant to ยง 6105, based on the amount of the
   foster care board and care payment that would be paid for the child&#8217;s
   care if the child were in foster care.

   6103.3. The payment schedule for the long-term permanent guardianship subsidy
   shall be:
