6105.1. CFSA shall conduct a review of a permanent guardianship subsidy:
   
   
   
   (a)	Annually;
   
   
   
   (b)	Whenever CFSA has information that indicates that the factors set forth in
   § 6104.4 apply;
   
   
   
   (c)	Whenever changes in the foster care board and care payments or the
   child&#8217;s age would change the permanent guardianship subsidy amount; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Upon request of the permanent guardian.

   6105.2. The review shall determine at least:
   
   
   
   (a)	Whether the legal guardian continues to meet the requirements of these
   rules;
   
   
   
   (b)	Whether any of the factors set forth in § 6104.4 apply;
   
   
   
   (c)	Whether any adjustment in the amount of the permanent guardianship subsidy
   should be made in light of the child&#8217;s age and any changes in the foster
   care board and care payment; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Whether there are any other factors that may necessitate a change in the
   permanent guardianship subsidy.

   6105.3. A review conducted pursuant to § 6105.1(d) shall commence not later
   than thirty (30) days after a completed written request is received by CFSA.

   6105.4. An adjustment in the amount of the permanent guardianship subsidy made
   as a result of a review conducted pursuant to § 6105.1(d) may be made
   retroactive to the date that the completed written request is received by
   CFSA.

   6105.5. If a recipient fails to cooperate with CFSA in its conduct of the
   review, CFSA shall terminate the permanent guardianship subsidy.
