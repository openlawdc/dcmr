                                  DC REGULATIONS

MEASUREMENT PROCEDURES (ยง 20-2905)

2905.1. Unless impracticable, earphones shall be used occasionally while noise
   measurements are being taken as a periodic check to ensure that the meter is
   responding properly to the noise source being monitored.

   2905.2. In the case of steady (including intermittent, slowly fluctuating, or
   quasi-steady) noise, a measurement of the ambient noise level shall be
   required.

   2905.3. If the ambient noise level of steady noise is within ten (10) dB(A) of
   the source sound level, the corrections specified in the table of ยง 2905.7 of
   this section shall be applied to determine the noise level due solely to the
   source being investigated, and the source shall be interpolated as necessary.

   2905.4. If the ambient level of steady noise is less than three (3) dB(A) from
   the noise source, no correction may be made and measurements cannot indicate
   true source noise level.

   2905.5. Before citing a violation of a noise limit which may not be exceeded
   regardless of duration, a two and five tenths (2.5) dB(A) grace shall be
   allowed to account for all possible meter inaccuracies.

   2905.6. Several measurements showing a violation shall be taken with at least
   twenty (20) seconds between each measurement.

   2905.7. The following table shall be used for making corrections to measured
   ambient sound pressure levels:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Difference (in decibels) between sound pressure level measured with sound
   source operating and ambient sound pressure level along dB(A)
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Correction (in decibels) to be subtracted from sound pressure level measured
   with sound source operating to obtain sound pressure level due to sound source
   along d B(A)
