2902.1. A battery check shall be performed immediately before and after a
   series of measurements at each test site.

   2902.2. An external calibration shall be made immediately before a series of
   measurements at each test site and, if necessary, the meter shall be adjusted
   to read within two tenths (0.2) dB(A) of the level specified by the
   calibration unit.

   2902.3. Measurements may be assumed to be valid if a calibration check after a
   series of measurements agrees to within five tenths (0.5) dB(A), otherwise
   measurements shall not be used.

   2902.4. Calibration checks also may be made immediately after the series of
   measurements and at least one (1) time per hour during the measurement series
   to ensure continuing accuracy of the equipment.
