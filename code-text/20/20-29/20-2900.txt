GENERAL PROVISIONS (§ 20-2900)

2900.1. The purpose of this chapter is to establish standard testing
   procedures for measuring noise levels as prescribed under the provisions of
   Chapters 27 and 28 of this subtitle, the D.C. Noise Control Act of 1977 (D.C.
   Law 2-53, March 23, 1978).

   2900.2. The intent of this chapter shall be to do the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Specify straight-forward procedures that are applicable to the large
   majority of expected situations; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Specify the limits of applicability of those procedures, such as
   situations in which acoustical specialists or specialized equipment may be
   required to supplement the procedures.

   2900.3. The measurement procedures provided in this chapter shall be reviewed
   periodically with reference to changes in the practice of noise measurement,
   instrumentation, District code, and legal precedent.

   2900.4. The measurement of noise produced by motor vehicles in transit shall
   be prescribed by District and federal laws. Enforcement by police officers
   shall be provided by District law.

   2900.5. Any situation in which the noise source cannot be demonstrated to
   increase the total noise at the measurement point by at least four (4) dB(A)
   over the ambient level shall be considered unmeasurable by the techniques
   described in this chapter.

   2900.6. Any situation in which readings exceed the statutory limits, but are
   less than the statutory limit plus the grace limit, the noise shall be
   measured with more specialized or more accurate equipment prior to deciding
   whether the source is in compliance with the Act.

   2900.7. When readings exceed the statutory limits, but are less than the
   statutory limit plus the grace limit, consultation with qualified professional
   personnel shall be required.
