                                  DC REGULATIONS

LEAF BLOWERS (§ 20-2808)

2808.1. Except as provided under § 2808.2, no person shall sell, offer for
   sale, or use, at any time, a leaf blower in the District of Columbia that has
   an average sound level exceeding seventy (70) dB(A) at a distance of fifty
   feet (50 ft.) from the leaf blower as measured in accordance with § 2808.5 of
   this section. A leaf blower shall not be used at nighttime, between the hours
   of 8:30 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. in the District of Columbia.

   2808.2. Upon the effective date of the District of Columbia Noise Control
   Amendment Act of 1992 (&#8220;1992 Act&#8221;), a person who sells, at retail,
   a leaf blower in the District of Columbia that exceeds the maximum sound level
   established in § 2808.1 of this section must provide conspicuous notice to
   the consumer that the leaf blower may not be used in the District.

   2808.3. A person who purchased a leaf blower prior to the effective date of
   the 1992 act, or who can demonstrate that the leaf blower was manufactured
   prior to the effective date of the 1992 Act, may use that leaf blower for the
   next five (5) years, even though its average sound level exceeds the standard
   established in § 2808.1 of this section, if its use is otherwise permitted by
   the Act.

   2808.4. In addition to any other enforcement measure authorized under this
   act, the Mayor may inspect and, upon request, require a person to produce any
   leaf blower that is sold, offered for sale, or used, in order to determine
   compliance with this act. The Mayor shall use, to the extent possible, a
   manufacturer&#8217;s written sound level representations, design and use
   specifications, and approximate manufacture date, as appropriate, as aids to
   determine compliance. A person who in good faith relies on a
   manufacturer&#8217;s written sound level representation is not subject to
   penalties under § 13 for violation of the Act.

   2808.5. Compliance with sound level requirements of this act shall be
   determined in accordance with a sound measurement testing standard for leaf
   blowers that has been deemed by the Mayor to be acceptable and adopted by
   regulation.
