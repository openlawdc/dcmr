                                  DC REGULATIONS

PERMIT APPLICATIONS (§ 20-301)

301.1. For each Part 70 source, the owner or operator shall submit a timely
   and complete permit application in accordance with the following outline:
   
   
   
   (a)	A timely application shall be submitted under the following conditions:
   
   
   
   (1)	Sources that are subject to the operating permit program established by
   this chapter as of the date the program is approved by the Administrator, the
   &#8220;effective date,&#8221; shall file applications on the following
   schedule:
   
   
   
   (A)	Sources that emitted one hundred fifty (150) tons per year or less of
   regulated pollutants in the aggregate during the previous calendar year shall
   file complete applications within eight (8) months of the effective date;
   Provided, that upon request and for good cause shown, the Mayor may allow a
   source additional time up to twelve (12) months from the effective date; and
   
   
   
   (B)	All other sources shall file complete applications within twelve (12)
   months of the effective date;
   
   
   
   (2)	A source that becomes subject to the operating permit program established
   by this chapter at any time following the effective date shall file a complete
   application within twelve (12) months of the date on which the source first
   becomes subject to the program;
   
   
   
   (3)	A source that is required to meet the requirements under § 112(g) of the
   Act, or to have a permit under a preconstruction review program under Title I
   of the Act, shall file a complete application to obtain an operating permit or
   permit amendment or modification within twelve (12) months after commencing
   operation. Where an existing operating permit would prohibit the construction
   or change in operation, the source shall obtain a permit revision before
   commencing operation;
   
   
   
   (4)	Sources subject to this chapter shall file an application for renewal of
   an operating permit at least six (6) months before the date of permit
   expiration, unless a longer period (not to exceed eighteen (18) months) is
   specified in the permit; and
   
   
   
   (5)	Sources required to submit applications for initial phase II acid rain
   permits shall submit the applications to the Mayor by January 1, 1996, for
   sulfur dioxide, and by January 1, 1998, for nitrogen oxides;
   
   
   
   (b)	The following procedures shall be followed when Part 70 permit
   applications are received:
   
   
   
   (1)	Within five (5) days of receipt of an application, the Mayor shall notify
   the applicant of the date on which the application was received and the date
   on which the application will automatically be deemed complete unless the
   Mayor determines otherwise;
   
   
   
   (2)	The Mayor shall review each application for completeness and shall inform
   the applicant within sixty (60) days if the application is incomplete. In
   order to be complete for purposes of this section, an application shall
   include a completed application form and, to the extent not called for by the
   form, the information required in § 301.3. An application shall be considered
   complete if it contains the information required by the application form and
   § 301.3;
   
   
   
   (3)	If the Mayor does not notify the source within sixty (60) days of receipt
   that its application is incomplete, the application shall be deemed complete.
   However, nothing in this subsection shall prevent the Mayor from requesting
   additional information in writing that is necessary to process the
   application;
   
   
   
   (4)	The Mayor shall maintain a checklist to be used for the completeness
   determination. A copy of the checklist shall be provided to applicants along
   with application forms issued by the Mayor;
   
   
   
   (5)	If, while processing an application that has been determined or deemed to
   be complete, the Mayor determines that additional information is necessary to
   evaluate or take final action on that application, the Mayor may request the
   additional information in writing. In requesting such information, the Mayor
   shall establish a reasonable deadline for a response; and
   
   
   
   (6)	In submitting an application for renewal of an operating permit issued
   under this chapter a source may identify terms and conditions in its previous
   permit that should remain unchanged and incorporate by reference those
   portions of its existing permit and the permit application and any permit
   amendment or modification applications that describe products, processes,
   operations, and emissions to which those terms and conditions apply. The
   source shall identify specifically and list which portions of its previous
   permit or applications are incorporated by reference. In addition, a renewal
   application shall contain the following:
   
   
   
   (A)	Information specified in § 301.3 for those products, processes,
   operations, and emissions of the following:
   
   
   
   (i)	That are not addressed in the existing permit;
   
   
   
   (ii)	That are subject to applicable requirements that are not addressed in the
   existing permit; or
   
   
   
   (iii)	That the source seeks permit terms and conditions that differ from those
   in the existing permit;
   
   
   
   (B)	A compliance plan and certification as required in § 301.3(h); and
   
   
   
   (C)	A compliance certification, as required by § 301.3(i); and
   
   
   
   (c)	If a source submits information to the Mayor under a claim of
   confidentiality pursuant to § 114(c) of the Federal Clean Air Act (hereafter
   referred to as &#8220;the Act&#8221;), the source shall also submit a copy of
   the information, along with the claim of confidentiality, directly to the
   Administrator, if the Mayor requests that the source do so. The contents of a
   Part 70 permit issued under this chapter shall not be entitled to confidential
   treatment.

   301.2. Any applicant who fails to submit any relevant facts or who has
   submitted incorrect information in a permit application shall, upon becoming
   aware of the failure or incorrect submittal, promptly submit the supplementary
   facts or corrected information. In addition, an applicant shall provide
   additional information as necessary to address any requirements that become
   applicable to the source after the date the applicant filed a complete
   application but prior to release of a draft permit.

   301.3. Sources that are subject to the operating permit program established by
   this chapter shall submit applications on the standard application form that
   the Mayor provides for that purpose. The application shall include information
   needed to determine the applicability of any applicable requirement and to
   evaluate the fee amount required under the schedule approved pursuant to §
   305. The applicant shall submit the information called for by the application
   form for each emissions unit at the source to be permitted. The standard
   application form and any attachments shall require that the following
   information be provided:
   
   
   
   (a)	Identifying information, including company name and address (or plant name
   and address if different from the company name), owner&#8217;s name and agent,

   (1)	All emissions of pollutants for which the source is major and all
   emissions of regulated air pollutants. The permit application shall describe
   all emissions of regulated air pollutants emitted from any emissions unit. The
   source shall submit additional information related to the emissions of
   regulated air pollutants sufficient to verify which requirements are
   applicable to the source, and other information necessary to determine the
   amount of any permit fees owed under the fee schedule approved pursuant to §
   305;
   
   
   
   (2)	Identification and description of all points of emissions described in §
   301.3(c)(1) in sufficient detail to establish the basis for fees and
