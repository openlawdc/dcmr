                                  DC REGULATIONS

PERMIT CONTENT (§ 20-302)

302.1. Except as provided for in § 300.3(b), every permit issued under these
   operating permit rules shall include all applicable requirements that apply to
   the permitted source at the time of issuance. Each permit shall include the
   following elements:
   
   
   
   (a)	The permit shall specify emissions limitations and standards that
   constitute applicable requirements, and shall include those operational
   requirements and limitations necessary to assure compliance with all
   applicable requirements, inclusive of the following:
   
   
   
   (1)	The permit shall specify and reference the origin of and authority for
   each term or condition, and identify any difference in form as compared to the
   applicable requirement upon which the term or condition is based;
   
   
   
   (2)	The permit shall state that, where an applicable requirement of the Act is
   more stringent than an applicable requirement of regulations promulgated under
   Title IV of the Act, both provisions shall be ncorporated into the permit and
   shall be enforceable by the Administrator; and
   
   
   
   (3)	If an applicable requirement allows a source to comply through an
   alternative emission limit or means of compliance, a source may request that
   an alternative limit or means of compliance be specified in its permit. An
   alternative emission limit or means of compliance shall be included in a
   source&#8217;s permit upon a showing that it is quantifiable, accountable,
   enforceable, and based on replicable procedures. The source shall propose
   permit terms and conditions to satisfy these requirements in its application;
   
   
   
   (b)	The permit shall specify a fixed term. The Mayor shall issue permits for
   any fixed period requested in the permit application, not to exceed five (5)
   years, except as provided in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph:
   
   
   
   (1)	Permits issued to affected sources shall in all cases have a fixed term of
   five (5) years;
   
   
   
   (2)	Permits issued to solid waste incineration units combusting municipal
   waste subject to standards under § 129(e) of the Act shall have a term not to
   exceed twelve (12) years. The permits shall be reviewed at least every five
   (5) years;
   
   
   
   (c)	To comply with monitoring and related recordkeeping and reporting
   requirements the following elements shall be required:
   
   
   
   (1)	Each permit shall contain the following requirements with respect to
   monitoring:
   
   
   
   (A)	All emissions monitoring and analysis procedures or test methods required
   under the applicable requirements, including any procedures and methods
   promulgated pursuant to § 114(a)(3) or 504(b) of the Act;
   
   
   
   (B)	Where the applicable requirement does not require periodic testing or
   instrumental or noninstrumental monitoring (which may consist of recordkeeping
   designed to serve as monitoring), periodic monitoring sufficient to yield
   reliable data from the relevant time period that are representative of the
   source&#8217;s compliance with the permit, as reported pursuant to §
   302.1(c)(3). The monitoring requirements shall assure use of terms, test
   methods, units, averaging periods, and other statistical conventions
   consistent with the applicable requirement. Recordkeeping provisions may be
   sufficient to meet the requirements of this subparagraph; and
   
   
   
   (C)	As necessary, requirements concerning the use, maintenance, and, where
   appropriate, installation of monitoring equipment or methods;
   
   
   
   (2)	With respect to recordkeeping, the permit shall incorporate all applicable
   recordkeeping requirements and require, where applicable, the following:
   
   
   
   (A)	Records of required monitoring information that include the following:
   
   
   
   (i)	The date, place as defined in the permit, and time of sampling or
   measurements;
   
   
   
   (ii)	The date(s) analyses were performed;
   
   
   
   (iii)	The company or entity that performed the analyses;
   
   
   
   (iv)	The analytical techniques or methods used;
   
   
   
   (v)	The results of the analyses; and
   
   
   
   (vi)	The operating conditions as existing at the time of sampling or
   measurement;
   
   
   
   (B)	Retention of records of all required monitoring data and support
   information for a period of at least five (5) years from the date of the
   monitoring sample, measurement, report, or application. Support information
   includes all calibration and maintenance records and all original strip-chart
   recordings for continuous monitoring instrumentation, and copies of all
   reports required by the permit. If appropriate, the permit may specify that
   records may be maintained in computerized form;
   
   
   
   (3)	With respect to reporting, the permit shall incorporate all applicable
   reporting requirements and require the following:
   
   
   
   (A)	A permit issued under this chapter shall require the permittee to submit a
   report of any required monitoring at least every six (6) months. To the extent
   possible, the schedule for submission of the reports shall be timed to
   coincide with other periodic reports required by the permit, including the
   permittee&#8217;s annual compliance certification;
   
   
   
   (B)	Each report submitted under subparagraph (3)(A) shall identify any
   deviations from permit requirements since the previous report, and any
   deviations from the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements under
   the permit;
   
   
   
   (C)	In addition to monitoring reports, each permittee shall be required to
   submit supplemental reports as follows:
   
   
   
   (i)	Any deviation resulting from emergency as defined in § 399.1 shall be
   reported within two (2) working days of the date on which the permittee first
   becomes aware of the deviation, if the permittee wishes to assert the
   affirmative defense authorized under § 302.7;
   
   
   
   (ii)	Any deviation that poses an imminent and substantial danger to public
   health, safety, or the environment shall be reported immediately;
   
   
   
   (iii)	Any other deviations that are identified in the permit as requiring more
   frequent reporting shall be reported on the schedule specified in the permit;
   and
   
   
   
   (iv)	All reports of deviations shall identify the probable cause of the
   deviations and any corrective actions or preventative measures taken;
   
   
   
   (D)	Every report submitted under this subsection shall be certified by a
   responsible official, except that if a report of a deviation required under
   subparagraph (3)(C) must be submitted within ten (10) days of the deviation,
   the report may be submitted in the first instance without a certification if
   an appropriate certification is provided within ten (10) days thereafter,
   together with any corrected or supplemental information required concerning
   the deviation; and
   
   
   
   (E)	A permittee may request confidential treatment for information in any
   report submitted under this subsection pursuant to the limitations and
   procedures set out in § 301.1(c);
   
   
   
   (d)	If the source is required to develop and register a risk management plan
   pursuant to § 112(r) of the Act, the permit need only specify that it will
   comply with the requirement to register such a plan. The content of the risk
   management plan need not itself be incorporated as a permit term;
   
   
   
   (e)	The permit shall prohibit emissions exceeding any allowances that the
   source lawfully holds under Title IV of the Act or the regulations promulgated
   thereunder:
   
   
   
   (1)	No permit revision shall be required for increases in emissions that are
   authorized by allowances acquired pursuant to the Acid Rain Program; Provided,
   that the increases do not require a permit revision under any other applicable
   requirement;
   
   
   
   (2)	No limit shall be placed on the number of allowances held by the source.
   The source may not, however, use allowances as a defense to noncompliance with
   any other applicable requirement; and
   
   
   
   (3)	Any such allowance shall be accounted for according to the procedures
   established in regulations promulgated under Title IV of the Act.
   
   
   
   (f)	The permit shall include a severability clause to ensure the continued
   validity of the various permit requirements in the event of a challenge to any
   portions of the permit;
   
   
   
   (g)	The permit shall include provisions stating the following general
   requirements:
   
   
   
   (1)	The permittee must comply with all conditions of the permit. Any
   noncompliance with the permit constitutes a violation of the Act and this
   chapter and is grounds for enforcement action or for permit revocation or
   modification or for denial of a permit renewal application;
   
   
   
   (2)	It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it
   would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to
   maintain compliance with the conditions of this permit;
   
   
   
   (3)	The permit may be reopened or revoked, for cause. Except as provided under
   § 303.5(b) for minor permit modifications, the filing of a permit reopening,
   revocation or termination, or of a notification of planned changes or
   anticipated noncompliance does not stay any permit condition;
   
   
   
   (4)	The permit does not convey any property rights of any sort, or any
   exclusive privilege; and
   
   
   
   (5)	The permittee shall furnish to the Mayor, upon receipt of a written
   request and within a reasonable time, any information that the Mayor may
   request to determine whether cause exists for, reopening, or revoking the
   permit or to determine compliance with the permit. Upon request, the permittee
   shall also furnish to the Mayor copies of records required to be kept by the
   permit. The permittee may make a claim of confidentiality pursuant to §
   301.1(c) for any information or records submitted under this paragraph;
   
   
   
   (h)	The permit shall provide that the permittee will pay fees to the Mayor
   consistent with the fee schedule established under § 305;
   
   
   
   (i)	The permit shall provide that no permit revision shall be required under
   any approved economic incentives, marketable permits, emissions trading and
   other similar programs or processes for changes that are provided for in the
   permit;
   
   
   
   (j)	The permit shall include terms and conditions which will meet all the
   applicable requirements and the requirements of this chapter for each of the
   operating scenarios described in the permit application and eligible for
   approval. The permit shall authorize the permittee to make changes among
   operating scenarios authorized in the permit without notice, but shall require
   the permittee contemporaneously with making a change from one operating
   scenario to another to record in a log at the permitted facility the scenario
   under which it is operating; and
   
   
   
   (k)	The permit shall include terms and conditions, if the permit applicant
   requests them, for the trading or averaging of emissions increases and
   decreases in the permitted stationary source, to the extent that the
   applicable requirements provide for trading or averaging such increases and
   decreases without a case-by-case approval of each emissions trade. The terms
   and conditions shall include terms under §§ 302.1 and 302.3 to determine
   compliance and shall satisfy all requirements of the applicable requirements
   authorizing the trading or averaging. The terms and conditions for the trading
   or averaging of emissions shall meet all applicable requirements and the
   requirements of the operating permits program.

   302.2. Each Part 70 permit shall have the following features with respect to
   enforceability:
   
   
   
   (a)	Except as provided in § 302.2(b), all terms and conditions in a permit
   issued under this chapter, including any provisions designed to limit a
   source&#8217;s potential to emit, are enforceable by the Mayor, by the
   Administrator, and by citizens under the Act; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Notwithstanding § 302.2(a), the Mayor shall designate as not being
   federally-enforceable under the Act any terms and conditions included in the
   permit that are not required under the Act or any of its applicable
   requirements, and such terms and conditions shall not be enforceable by the
   Administrator and citizens under the Act. Terms and conditions so designated
   shall not be subject to the requirements of §§ 303 and 304 of this chapter
   or of 40 CFR Part 70. Terms and conditions designated under this paragraph may
   be included in an addendum to the source&#8217;s permit.

   302.3. All permits issued under Part 70 shall contain the following elements
   with respect to compliance:
   
   
   
   (a)	Consistent with § 302.1(c), compliance certification, testing,
   monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to assure
   compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit. Any document
   (including reports) required by a permit under this chapter shall contain a
   certification by a responsible official as to the results of the required
   monitoring pursuant to § 301.4;
   
   
   
   (b)	Inspection and entry requirements that require that, upon presentation of
   credentials and other documents as may be required by law, the permittee shall
   allow authorized officials of the Mayor to perform the following:
   
   
   
   (1)	Enter upon the permittee&#8217;s premises where a source is located or
   emissions-related activity is conducted, or where records shall be kept under
   the conditions of the permit;
   
   
   
   (2)	Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must be
   kept under the conditions of the permit;
   
   
   
   (3)	Inspect at reasonable times any facilities, equipment (including
   monitoring and air pollution control equipment), practices, or operations
   regulated or required under the permit; and
   
   
   
   (4)	As authorized by the Act, sample or monitor at reasonable times substances
   or parameters for the purpose of assuring compliance with the permit or
   applicable requirements;
   
   
   
   (c)	A schedule of compliance to the extent required under § 301.3(h)(3);
   
   
   
   (d)	To the extent required under an applicable schedule of compliance and §
   301.3(h), progress reports, to be submitted semiannually, or more frequently
   if specified in the applicable requirement or by the Mayor. The progress
   reports shall contain the following:
   
   
   
   (1)	Dates for achieving the activities, milestones, or compliance required in
   the schedule of compliance, and dates when the activities, milestones or
   compliance were achieved; and
   
   
   
   (2)	An explanation of why any dates in the schedule of compliance were not or
   will not be met, and any preventive or corrective measures adopted;
   
   
   
   (e)	Requirements for compliance certification with terms and conditions
   contained in the permit that are federally-enforceable, including emission
   limitations, standards, or work practices. Each permit shall specify the
   following:
   
   
   
   (1)	The frequency (which shall be annually unless the applicable requirement
   specifies submission more frequently) of submissions of compliance
   certifications;
   
   
   
   (2)	In accordance with § 302.1(c), a means for monitoring the compliance of
   the source with emissions limitations, standards, and work practices contained
   in applicable requirements;
   
   
   
   (3)	A requirement that the compliance certification include the following:
   
   
   
   (A)	The identification of each term or condition of the permit that is the
   basis of the certification;
   
   
   
   (B)	The permittee&#8217;s current compliance status;
   
   
   
   (C)	Data and status reports demonstrating whether compliance was continuous or
   intermittent;
   
   
   
   (D)	The method(s) used for determining the compliance status of the source,
   currently and over the reporting period as required by § 302.1(c); and
   
   
   
   (E)	Any other facts as the Mayor may require to determine the compliance
   status of the source;
   
   
   
   (4)	A requirement that all compliance certifications be submitted to the
   Administrator as well as to the Mayor;
   
   
   
   (5)	Any additional requirements as may be specified pursuant to §§ 114(a)(3)
   and 504(b) of the Act; and
   
   
   
   (f)	Any other provisions as the Mayor may require.

   302.4. General permits may be issued under the following circumstances:
   
   
   
   (a)	The Mayor may issue a general permit, complying with all requirements
   applicable to other Part 70 permits, to any source category if the Mayor
   concludes that the category is appropriate for permitting on a generic basis.
   No general permit may be issued for affected sources under the Acid Rain
   Program unless otherwise provided in regulations promulgated under Title IV of
   the Act;
   
   
   
   (b)	A general permit may be issued for a source category based upon an
   application from a source within the source category or upon the Mayor&#8217;s
   own initiative. The Mayor shall, following receipt of an application for a
   general permit, or upon a determination that issuance of a general permit for
   a category of sources may be appropriate, follow the same procedures for
   issuance of a general permit as for any other permit issued under Part 70;
   
   
   
   (c)	A general permit may be issued for the following purposes:
   
   
   
   (1)	To establish terms and conditions to implement applicable requirements for
   a source category;
   
   
   
   (2)	To establish terms and conditions to implement applicable requirements for
   specified categories of changes to permitted sources;
   
   
   
   (3)	To establish terms and conditions for new requirements that apply to
   sources with existing permits; and
   
   
   
   (4)	To establish federally-enforceable caps on emissions from sources in a
   specified category;
   
   
   
   (d)	The Mayor may issue a general permit if the Mayor finds the following:
   
   
   
   (1)	There are several permittees, permit applicants, or potential permit
   applicants who have the same or substantially similar operations, emissions,
   activities, or facilities;
   
   
   
   (2)	The permittees, permit applicants, or potential permit applicants emit the
   same types of regulated air pollutants;
   
   
   
   (3)	The operations, emissions, activities, or facilities are subject to the
   same or similar standards, limitations, and operating requirements; and
   
   
   
   (4)	The operations, emissions, activities, or facilities are subject to the
   same or similar monitoring requirements;
   
   
   
   (e)	A general permit issued under this section shall identify criteria by
   which sources may qualify for the general permit. After the Mayor has issued a
   general permit, the source named in the permit may submit a request for
   coverage under the permit subject to the following conditions:
   
   
   
   (1)	A request for coverage under a general permit shall identify the source
   and provide information sufficient to demonstrate that the source meets the
   general permit qualification criteria and that the source is in compliance
   with the general permit. The request shall provide any additional information
   the general permit specifies; and
   
   
   
   (2)	A final action approving a request for coverage under a general permit
   shall not be subject to public comment or judicial review;
   
   
   
   (f)	A copy of the general permit, together with a list of sources approved for
   coverage under it, shall be kept on file for public review;
   
   
   
   (g)	A general permit issued under this section shall expressly provide that
   any source approved for coverage under a general permit shall be entitled to
   the protection of the permit shield provisions of § 302.6 for all operations,
   activities, and emissions addressed by the general permit. Notwithstanding the
   shield provisions of § 302.6, the source shall be subject to enforcement
   action for operation without a permit if it is subsequently determined that
   the source does not qualify for the conditions and terms of the general
   permit; and
   
   
   
   (h)	If some, but not all, of a source&#8217;s operations, activities, and
   emissions are eligible for coverage under one or more general permits, the
   source may apply for coverage under the general permits for the operations,
   activities, and emissions that are so eligible. If the source is required
   under § 300 to obtain a permit addressing the remainder of its operations,
   activities, and emissions, it must apply for and receive a permit addressing
   those items not covered by general permits.

   302.5. The Mayor may issue a single permit authorizing emissions from similar
   operations by the same source owner or operator at multiple temporary
   locations. The operation shall be temporary and involve at least one change of
   location during the term of the permit. No affected source shall be permitted
   as a temporary source. Permits for temporary sources shall include the
   following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Conditions that will assure compliance with all applicable requirements at
   all authorized locations;
   
   
   
   (b)	Requirements that the owner or operator notify the permitting authority at
   least ten (10) days in advance of each change in location; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Conditions that assure compliance with all other provisions of this
   section.

   302.6. A permit shield shall apply to a Part 70 source under the following
   conditions:
   
   
   
   (a)	The Mayor may expressly include in a Part 70 permit a provision stating
   that compliance with the conditions of the permit shall be deemed compliance
   with any applicable requirements as of the date of permit issuance; Provided,
   that:
   
   
   
   (1)	The applicable requirements are included and specifically identified in
   the permit; or
   
   
   
   (2)	The Mayor, in acting on the permit application or revision, determines in
   writing that other requirements specifically identified are not applicable to
   the source, and the permit includes the determination or a concise summary of
   the determination;
   
   
   
   (b)	A Part 70 permit that does not expressly state that a permit shield exists
   shall be presumed not to provide a shield;
   
   
   
   (c)	Nothing in this section or in the permit shall alter or affect the
   following:
   
   
   
   (1)	The provisions of § 303 of the Act, including the authority of the
   Administrator under that section;
   
   
   
   (2)	The liability of an owner or operator of a source for any violation of
   applicable requirements prior to or at the time of permit issuance;
   
   
   
   (3)	The applicable requirements of the Acid Rain Program, consistent with §
   408(a) of the Act; or
   
   
   
   (4)	The ability of the Administrator to obtain information from a source
   pursuant to § 114 of the Act.

   302.7. Emergencies shall be provided for in the following manner:
   
   
   
   (a)	An emergency constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for
   noncompliance with the technology-based emission limitations if the conditions
   of § 302.7(b) are met;
   
   
   
   (b)	The affirmative defense of an emergency shall be demonstrated through
   properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence
   that:
   
   
   
   (1)	An emergency occurred and that the permittee can identify the cause(s) of
   the emergency;
   
   
   
   (2)	The permitted stationary source was at the time being properly operated;
   
   
   
   
   
   (3)	During the period of the emergency the permittee took all reasonable steps
   to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the emission standards, or other
   requirements in the permit; and
   
   
   
   (4)	The permittee submitted notice of the emergency to the Mayor within two
   (2) working days of the time when emission limitations were exceeded due to
   the emergency. The notice shall contain description of the emergency, any
   steps taken to mitigate emissions, and corrective actions taken pursuant to §
   302.1(c)(3)(C)(i) of this section;
   
   
   
   (c)	In any enforcement proceeding, the permittee seeking to establish the
   occurrence of an emergency has the burden of proof; and
   
   
   
   (d)	This provision is in addition to any emergency or upset provision
   contained in any applicable requirement.

   302.8. Each permit issued under Part 70 shall provide that a permitted
   stationary source is expressly authorized to make a § 502(b)(10) change
   within the stationary source without a permit amendment or permit
   modification, if the change is not a modification under any provision of Title
   I of the Act, does not include any change in the date of the source&#8217;s
   compliance schedule and the change does not result in a level of emissions
   exceeding the emissions allowable under the permit whether expressed therein
   as a rate of emissions or in terms of total emissions under the following
   conditions:
   
   
   
   (a)	Before making a change under this provision, the permittee shall provide
   advance written notice to the Mayor and to the Administrator, describing the
   change to be made, the date on which the change will occur, any changes in
   emissions, and any permit terms and conditions that are affected including
   those which are no longer applicable. The permittee shall thereafter maintain
   a copy of the notice with the permit, and the Mayor shall place a copy with
   the permit in the public file. The written notice shall be provided to the
   Mayor and the Administrator at least seven (7) days before the change is to be
   made, except that this period may be shortened or eliminated as necessary for
   a change that must be implemented more quickly to address unanticipated
   conditions posing a significant health, safety, or environmental hazard. If
   less than seven (7) days notice is provided because of a need to respond more
   quickly to the unanticipated conditions, the permittee shall provide notice to
   the Mayor and the Administrator immediately upon learning of the need to make
   the change;
   
   
   
   (b)	A permitted source may rely on the authority of this section to trade
   increases and decreases in emissions within the stationary source, where the
   applicable requirements provide for the emissions trades without a permit
   revision. In such a case, the advance written notice provided by the permittee
   shall identify the underlying authority authorizing the trading and shall
   state when the change will occur, the types and quantities of emissions to be
   traded, the permit terms or other applicable requirements with which the
   source will comply through emissions trading, and any other information as may
   be required by the applicable requirement authorizing the emissions trade;
   
   
   
   (c)	The permit shield provided under § 302.6 shall not apply to changes made
   under this section, except those provided for in § 302.8(d); however, the
   protection of the permit shield will continue to apply to operations and
   emissions that are not affected by the changes; Provided, that the permittee
   complies with the terms and conditions of the permit applicable to such
   operations and emissions. The shield may be reinstated for emissions and
   operations affected by the change:
   
   
   
   (1)	If subsequent changes cause the stationary source&#8217;s operations and
   emissions to revert to those contained in the permit and the permittee resumes
   compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit; or
   
   
   
   (2)	If the permittee obtains a significant modification to the permit pursuant
   to § 303.5(d) to codify the change in the permit, and the modified permit
   expressly provides protection under the shield for the change; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Upon the request of a permit applicant, the Mayor shall issue a permit
   that contains terms and conditions allowing for the trading of emissions
   increases and decreases in the permitted stationary source solely for the
   purpose of complying with a federally-enforceable emissions cap that is
   established in the permit independent of otherwise applicable requirements.
   The permit applicant shall include in its application proposed replicable
   procedures and permit terms that assure that the emissions trades are
   quantifiable and enforceable and comply with all applicable requirements and
   §§ 302.1 and 302.3. The permit shield under § 302.6 shall apply to permit
   terms and conditions authorizing such increases and decreases in emissions.
   Under this paragraph, the written notification required under this section
   shall state when the change will occur and shall describe the changes in
   emissions that will result and how these increases and decreases in emissions
   will comply with the terms and conditions of the permit.

   302.9. Except as provided in § 302.9(e), a stationary source may make any
   change in its operations or emissions that is not addressed or prohibited in
   its permit, without obtaining an amendment or modification of its permit. The
   changes shall be subject to the following requirements and restrictions:
   
   
   
   (a)	The change shall meet all applicable requirements and may not violate any
   existing permit term or condition;
   
   
   
   (b)	The permittee shall provide contemporaneous written notice of the change
   to the Mayor and to the Administrator. The written notice shall describe each
   such change, including the date, any change in emissions, pollutants emitted,
   and any applicable requirement that would apply as a result of the change;
   
   
   
   (c)	The change shall not qualify for the permit shield under § 302.6;
   
   
   
   (d)	The permittee shall keep a record describing all changes made at the
   source that result in emissions of a regulated air pollutant subject to an
   applicable requirement, but not otherwise regulated under the permit, and the
   emissions resulting from those changes; and
   
   
   
   (e)	No permittee may make, without a revision of its permit, a change that is
   not addressed or prohibited by its permit if such change is subject to any
   requirements under Title IV of the Act or is a modification under any
   provision of Title I of the Act.
