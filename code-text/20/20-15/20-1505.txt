   cannot be resolved by the affected agency heads:
   
   
   
   (1)	The Director of DDOE may elevate the conflict to the Mayor in accordance
   with the procedures of subsection 1505.3; or
   
   
   
   (2)	If the Director of DDOE does not appeal to the Mayor within 14 days as
   provided in § 1505.3(a), the MPO may proceed with its final conformity
   determination; and
   
   
   
   (c)	In the case of interstate nonattainment areas, if the conflict involves
   agencies outside of the District, Maryland, or Virginia, and the conflict
   cannot be resolved by the affected agency heads, the conflict may be resolved
   in a manner mutually agreed to by the parties involved.

   1505.3. Appeals to the Mayor by the Director of DDOE under the provisions of
   § 1505.2(b)(1) shall be in accordance with the following procedures:
   
   
   
   (a)	The Director of DDOE has 14 calendar days to appeal to the Mayor after the
   MPO or DDOT has notified the Director of DDOE of the MPO&#8217;s or
   DDOT&#8217;s resolution of the Department&#8217;s comments;
   
   
   
   (b)	The notification to the Director of DDOE shall be in writing and shall be
   hand-delivered;
   
   
   
   (c)	The 14-day appeal commences when DDOT or MPO has confirmed receipt by the
   Director of DDOE of the agency&#8217;s or MPO&#8217;s resolution of the
   Department&#8217;s comments;
   
   
   
   (d)	The appeal to the Mayor shall contain:
   
   
   
   (1)	The conformity determination and any supporting documentation;
   
   
   
   (2)	DDOE&#8217;s comments on the determination; and
   
   
   
   (3)	Any response by the MPO or DDOT;
   
   
   
   (e)	DDOE shall provide a complete appeal package to the MPO and DDOT within 24
   hours following the date on which the appeal is filed with the Mayor&#8217;s
   Office;
   
   
   
   (f)	If the Mayor does not concur with the conformity determination, the Mayor
   may direct revision of the applicable implementation plan, revision of the
   planned program of projects, revision of the conformity analysis, or any
   combination of these;
   
   
   
   (g)	If the Mayor concurs with the conformity determination made by the MPO and
   DDOT, the MPO and DDOT may proceed with the final conformity determination;
   and
   
   
   
   (h)	The Mayor may delegate the Mayor&#8217;s role in this process, but not to
   the agency head or staff of the DDOE or DDOT.

   1505.4. This regulation does not prevent the District agencies and MPO from
   making efforts on their own initiative to obtain mutual conflict resolution
   through conferences or other appropriate means.
