TRANSPORTATION CONFORMITY – INTERAGENCY CONSULTATION REQUIREMENTS (§ 20-1504)

1504.1 	In accordance with this chapter, representatives of the MPO, RPO,
   DDOE, and DDOT shall undertake an interagency consultation process with the
   FHWA, FTA, and EPA on the development of the UPWP, transportation plans, TIPs,
   SIPs, associated conformity determinations, and any revisions to the plans or
   programs thereof as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	The MPO is the lead agency responsible for preparing an amendment or
   revision of the UPWP, the transportation plan, or the TIP, and for making
   conformity determinations;
   
   
   
   (b)	DDOE is the lead agency responsible for preparing revisions to the SIP,
   and incorporating TCMs recommended by the MPO and DDOT; and
   
   
   
   (c)	In the case of metropolitan nonattainment and maintenance areas that have
   a certified RPO, the RPO is the agency responsible for preparing an air
   quality plan, and for assuring the adequacy of the interagency consultation
   process with respect to the development of the proposed air quality plan, and
   any amendments or revisions to the plan.

   1504.2. When serving as lead agency, the MPO, RPO, DDOT, and DDOE have the
   following responsibilities:
   
   
   
   (a)	Initiating the applicable consultation process by notifying other
   participants, convening meetings, preparing summaries, assuring that all
   relevant documents and information are supplied to all participants in the
   consultation process in a timely manner, maintaining a written record of the
   consultation process, and providing final documents and supporting information
   to each participating agency after approval or adoption;
   
   
   
   (b)	Enabling regular consultation on major activities (such as the development
   of a transportation plan, the development of a TIP, any determination of
   conformity on transportation plans or TIPs, or the development of a SIP),
   including meetings beginning on a date determined by the lead agency to be
   adequate to meet the date a final decision is required and continuing at a
   frequency mutually agreed upon by the affected agencies;
   
   
   
   (c)	Convening meetings of technical staff as necessary;

   nonattainment areas;
   
   
   
   (g)	In cooperation with DDOT, determining which transportation projects should
   be considered &#8220;regionally significant&#8221; for the purpose of regional
   emission analysis (in addition to those functionally classified as principal
   arterial roadway or higher classifications, fixed guideway systems, or
   extensions that offer an alternative to regional highway travel), and which
   projects should be considered to have a significant change in design concept
   and scope from the transportation plan or TIP;
   
   
   
   (h)	In cooperation with DDOT, assuring that plans for construction of
   regionally significant projects which are not FHWA or FTA funded or approved
   projects (including projects for which alternative locations, design concept
   and scope, or the no-build options are still being considered), including all
   plans by recipients of funds designated under the Federal Aid Highway Act of
   1962, as amended,  23 U.S.C. § 134 et seq., or the federal transit laws,  49
   U.S.C. § 5303 et seq., are disclosed by the MPO members, and that any changes

   seq., or  49 U.S.C § 5303 et seq.;
   
   
   
   (i)	In cooperation with DDOT, designing, scheduling, and funding research and

   transportation demand analysis, including vehicle miles traveled (VMT)
   forecasting;
   
   
   
   (k)	In cooperation with DDOT and DDOE, evaluating whether projects otherwise
   exempted from meeting the requirements of 40 CFR § 93.127 should be treated
   as nonexempt in cases where potential adverse emissions impacts may exist for
   any reason;
   
   
   
   (l)	In cooperation with DDOT and DDOE, making a determination as required by
   40 CFR § 93.113, whether past obstacles to implementation of TCMs that are
   behind the schedule established in the applicable implementation plan have
   been identified and are being overcome, and whether State and local agencies
   with influence over approvals or funding for TCMs are giving maximum priority
   to approvals or funding for TCMs, and as part of this consultation,
   considering whether delays in TCM implementation necessitate revisions to the
   applicable implementation plan to remove TCM or substitute TCMs or other
   emission reduction measures;
   
   
   
   (m)	In cooperation with DDOT and DDOE, determining what forecast of vehicle
   miles traveled (VMT) to use in establishing or tracking emissions budgets,
