                                  DC REGULATIONS

VARIANCES (ยง 20-3108)

3108.1. Requests for a variance from the requirements of this Chapter may be
   granted upon a written request to DCRA. Requests for a variance that may
   affect the base flood elevation as provided by ยง 3105.8 shall also be
   submitted to DDOE. Consideration shall be given, but shall not be limited to,
   the following factors:
   
   
   
   (a) 	That there is good and sufficient cause to grant the request;
   
   
   
   (b) 	That the full performance of the requirements of this chapter would
   result in undue hardship by reason of excessive structural or mechanical
   difficulty or impracticality of bringing the premises affected into full
   compliance with this Chapter; and
   
   
   
   (c) 	Granting the variance would not result in an unacceptable or prohibited
   increase in flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
   public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on, or victimization of the
   public or conflict with any other applicable laws and regulations.

   3108.2. No variance shall be granted for any construction, development, use or
   activity within any floodway area that would cause any increase in the base
   flood elevation.

   3108.3. Except for a possible modification of the freeboard requirements
   involved, no variance shall be granted for any of the other requirements
   pertaining specifically to development which may endanger human life (ยง
   3106.2).

   3108.4. A variance shall involve only the least modification necessary to
   provide relief.

   3108.5. In granting any variance, the Director of DCRA or his or her delegated
   representative shall attach reasonable conditions and safeguards considered
   necessary in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and to
   achieve the objectives of D.C. Law 1-64 and this Chapter.

   3108.6. Whenever a variance is granted, the Director of DCRA or his or her
   delegated representative shall notify the applicant, in writing, of the
   following:
   
   
   
   (a) 	The granting of the variance may result in increased premium rates of up
   to twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for every one hundred dollars ($100.00) for
   flood insurance; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The variances may increase the risks to life and property.

   3108.7. A complete record of all variance requests and related actions shall
   be maintained by the Director of DCRA or his or her delegated representative.
   In addition, a report of all variances granted during the year shall be
   included in the annual report to the Federal Insurance Administration.

   3108.8. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, however, all structures
   shall be designed and constructed so as to have the capability of resisting
   the base flood.
