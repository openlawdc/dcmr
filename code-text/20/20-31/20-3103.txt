BUILDING PERMITS (§ 20-3103)

3103.1. In any SFHA, a building permit issued by DCRA shall be required for
   all new construction or development, as defined in § 3199.1 of this Chapter.

   3103.2. DCRA shall not issue a building permit for any project in an SFHA
   unless DDOE and all other responsible agencies have determined that the
   proposed work to be undertaken will be in conformance with the requirements of
   this Chapter and all other applicable codes and regulations within each
   agency’s authority.

   3103.3. Before DCRA issues any building permit in any SFHA, DCRA and DDOE
   shall review the permit application to determine if the applicant has obtained
   all other governmental permits required by the District of Columbia and
   Federal law, such as those required by the Federal Clean Water Act, 1334
   U.S.C. § 404. No permit shall be issued until this determination has been
   made and permits have been obtained.

   alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any watercourse which
   would reduce the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse.

   3103.5. The applicant shall notify the National Flood Insurance Program
   (NFIP), the Floodplain Administrator, and all adjacent communities before
   altering or relocating any watercourse.
