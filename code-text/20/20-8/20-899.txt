   Business entity &#8211; a partnership, firm, association, corporation, or sole
   proprietorship that is engaged in asbestos abatement.

   asbestos from becoming airborne.
   
   
   
   High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter &#8211; a filter capable of
   trapping and retaining at least ninety-nine and ninety-seven hundredths
   percent (99.97%) of all monodispersed particles three tenths (0.3) micrometers
   ([mu] m) in diameter or larger.
   
   
   
   Negative pressure system &#8211; equipment that ensures that the static
   pressure in an enclosed work area is lower than that of the environment
   outside the containment barriers.
   
   
   
   Person &#8211; an individual or non-business entity, including a District of
   Columbia government employee.

   APPENDIX 8-1
   
   
   
   EMISSION LIMITS FOR NITROGEN OXIDE
   
   
   
   Emission limits for nitrogen oxide in fossil-fuel-fired steam generating units
   of more than one hundred million (100,000,000) British Thermal Units (BTU.)
   per hour heat input are as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	Two tenths (0.2) lb. per million BTU heat input (0.36 g. per million cal.)
   maximum two (2) hour average, expressed in NO2, when gaseous fossil fuel is
   burned:
   
   
   
   (b)	Three tenths (0.3) lb. per million BTU heat input (0.54 g. per million
   cal.) maximum two (2) hour average, express as NO2, when liquid fossil fuel is
   burned;
   
   
   
   (c)	Seven tenths (0.7) lb. per million BTU heat input (1.26 g.per million
   cal.) maximum two (2) hour average. expressed NO2, when solid fossil fuel
   (except lignite) is burned; and
   
   
   
   (d)	When different fossil fuels are burned simultaneously in any combination
   the applicable standard shall be determined by proration, according to the
   following formula:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   x(0.2)+y(0.3)+z(0.7)
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   x+y+z
   
   
   
   
   
   
   x	is the percent of total heat input derived from gaseous fossil fuel;
   
   y	is the percent of total heat input derived from liquid fossil fuel; and
   
   z	is the percent of total heat input derived from solid fossil fuel.
