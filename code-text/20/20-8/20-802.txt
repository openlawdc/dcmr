                                  DC REGULATIONS

SULFUR CONTENT OF COAL (ยง 20-802)

802.1. The purchase, sale, offer for sale, storage, transport, or use of coal
   which contains more than one percent (1%) sulfur by weight in the District
   shall be prohibited, if the coal is to be burned in the District. However,
   when the Mayor certifies in writing that the combustion-gas-desulfurization
   system used at a stationary source results in sulfur oxide emissions no
   greater than the emissions normally resulting from the burning of coal with
   one percent (1%) sulfur content, coal of a higher sulfur content may be burned
   at the stationary source.

   802.2. Application for a certification shall be made, in writing, to the Mayor
   by the owner or operator of the stationary source and, upon presentation to a
   seller of the certification, a copy of which shall be retained by the seller,
   the sale, purchase, and transportation of the coal shall be permitted.
