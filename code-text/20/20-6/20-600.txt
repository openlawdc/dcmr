                                  DC REGULATIONS

FUEL-BURNING PARTICULATE EMISSION (§ 20-600)

600.1. The emission of particulate matter from any fuel burning equipment
   shall not be in excess of the rate determined by the following formula:
   
   
   
   E = 0.17455 H-0.23522
   
   Where:
   
   E = Allowable emissions in pounds per million British Thermal Units (BTUs) of
   heat input, and
   
   H = Heat input to the fuel-burning equipment in millions of BTUs per hour;
   
   Provided, that:
   
   
   
   (a)	Nothing in § 600.1 shall be construed to allow the emission of
   particulate matter from any fuel-burning equipment in excess of the rate of
   thirteen hundredths pound (0.13 lb) per million BTU of heat input; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Nothing herein shall be construed to require the emission of particulate
   matter from any fuel-burning equipment to be lower than the rate of two
   hundredths pound (0.02 lb) per million BTU of heat input.

   600.2. Compliance with or violation of § 600.1 shall be determined by
   performance tests conducted when the fuel-burning equipment (from now on
   referred to as &#8220;equipment&#8221;) is operating under conditions
   encountered in normal operation that create the worst emissions in relation to
   allowable emissions. Tests shall be conducted at the maximum continuous
   operating capacity of the equipment unless the Mayor has reason to believe
   that the worst emissions in relation to allowable emissions occur under other
   conditions.

   600.3. For equipment equipped for the blowing of soot, the frequency of soot
   blowing during performance tests shall be proportioned to the frequency of
   soot blowing during the conditions at which the equipment is tested.

   600.4. Equipment shall not be specially tuned or optimized immediately before
   performance testing unless the owner or operator of the equipment represents
   in writing to the Mayor that the equipment will be maintained in an optimized
   condition subsequent to performance testing.

   600.5. The conditions for testing may be modified by the Mayor to suit
   specified sampling conditions or needs based on good practice, judgment and
   experience; Provided, that no such modification shall have the effect of
   increasing the stringency of the standard.

   600.6. When determining compliance with or violation of § 600.1 by
   performance tests, the test results shall be calculated using the method
   described in § 60.45(f)(5) of Title 40 CFR, revised as of July 1, 1982.

   600.7. The blowing of soot from any fuel-burning equipment fired by solid
   fuels shall be prohibited except during the hours of 10 a.m to 4 p.m.;
   Provided, that the Mayor may allow the blowing of soot during other periods
   upon a finding that the blowing of soot is desirable for the efficient
   operation of the fuel-burning equipment or for the safety of personnel or
   equipment.
