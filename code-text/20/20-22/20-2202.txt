DENIAL, SUSPENSION, AND REVOCATION OF REGISTRATION (ยง 20-2202)

2202.1. If it does not appear to the Director that a pesticide registered
   under the Director&#8217;s authority warrants the proposed claims for it, or
   if the pesticide and its labeling and other material required to be submitted
   do not comply with the pesticide provisions of this title, the Director shall
   notify the applicant of the manner in which the pesticide, labeling, or other
   material required to be submitted fails to comply with the provisions of the
   Act so as to afford the applicant an opportunity to make the necessary
   corrections.

   2202.2. If, upon receipt of the notice required by ยง 2202.1, the applicant
   does not make the required changes, the Director may refuse to register the
   pesticide.

   2202.3. The Director may refuse, suspend, or cancel the registration of any
   pesticide if he or she determines the following conditions exist:
   
   
   
   (a)	That the pesticide, its labeling, or other material required to be
   submitted do not comply with the pesticide provisions of this title; or
   
   
   
   (b)	That the refusal, suspension, or cancellation is necessary to prevent
   unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.

   2202.4. When the Director determines that there is an imminent hazard, the
   Director may suspend, on his or her own motion, the registration of a
   pesticide registered under the Director&#8217;s authority.

   2202.5. In refusing an application for registration, or before suspending or
   canceling a registration, the Director shall notify the registrant in writing
   of the proposed action and the basis for the proposed action.

   2202.6. The registrant shall have thirty (30) business days from the date of
   receipt of the notice of the proposed action to request a hearing before the
   Director to show cause why registration should not be refused, canceled, or
   suspended.
