REGISTRATION OF PESTICIDES (§ 20-2200)

2200.1. Only those compounds that are registered with the Pesticide
   Registration Division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the
   &#8220;EPA&#8221;) shall be manufactured, sold, shipped, used, or applied in
   the District, and they shall be used only in the manner or manners specified
   and approved by the EPA.

   2200.2. The Mayor may, in his or her discretion, require that pesticides
   registered with the EPA which are distributed within the District shall be
   registered also with the Mayor.

   distributed in the District shall be registered with the Director of the
   Department of Environmental Services (the &#8220;Director&#8221;).

   2200.4. Registration shall not be required if a pesticide is shipped from one
   (1) plant or warehouse to another plant or warehouse operated by the same
   person and used solely at the plant or warehouse as a constituent part to make
   a pesticide which is registered under the provisions of the Act, or if the
   pesticide is distributed under the provisions of an experimental use permit
   issued by the EPA.

   2200.5. No person shall use or reveal for his or her own advantage any
   information relative to the formula of pesticide products acquired by the
   authority of § 3 of the Act, except that, this provision shall not be deemed
   to prohibit the disclosure of information to the Director, to proper officials
   or employees of the District, to courts of competent jurisdiction in response
   to a subpoena, or to physicians or pharmacists or other qualified persons for
   use in the preparation of antidotes.

   2200.6. If it appears to the Director that the composition of a pesticide
   warrants the proposed claims for it, and if the pesticide and its labeling and
   other material required to be submitted comply with the requirements of the
   Act, the Director shall register the pesticide.

   2200.7. All pesticides registered in the District pursuant to the pesticide
   provisions of this title (Chapters 22 through 25) shall be distributed in the
   registrant&#8217;s or the manufacturer&#8217;s unbroken immediate container.

   2200.8. A label bearing the information required by the Federal Insecticide,
   Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (&#8220;FIFRA&#8221;) shall be affixed to the
   container of each registered pesticide, and to the outside container or
   wrapper, if any.

   2200.9. No person shall detach, alter, deface, or destroy, wholly or in part,
   any label or labeling prescribed by FIFRA.
