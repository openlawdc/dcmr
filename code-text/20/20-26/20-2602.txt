   quality control and quality assurance program;
   
   
   
   (b)	Except as provide in § 2602.2, manufactures shall test cigarettes to
   determine compliance with this chapter in accordance with the American Society
   of Testing and Materials (ASTM) &#8220;Standard Test for Measuring the
   Ignition Strength of Cigarettes&#8221; (ASTM Standard E2187-04);
   
   
   
   (c)	Cigarette testing shall be conducted on ten (10) layers of filter paper;
   
   
   
   (d)	No more than twenty-five per cent (25%) of the cigarettes tested in a test
   trial shall exhibit fill-length burns;
   
   
   
   (e)	The performance standard required by this section shall apply only to a
   complete test trial; and
   
   
   
   (f)	A complete test trial shall consist of forty (40) replicate tests for each
   cigarette tested.

   2602.2. If the Chief determines that a manufacturer&#8217;s cigarettes cannot
   be tested according to the test method prescribed by § 2602.1, the Chief may
   approve a test method or performance standard the manufacturer, or another
   entity, proposes if the Chief determines that the alternative method is
   equivalent to and as effective as the test method or performance standard
   prescribed by § 2602.1.

   2602.3. If the Chief approves an alternative test method or performance
   standard, the manufacturer may use that test method or performance standard as
   the test method or performance standard required by § 2602.1
