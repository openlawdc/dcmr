   (a)	Meets the UST performance standards for new hazardous substance USTs set
   forth in § 5702; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Meets the permanent closure requirements set forth in Chapter 61,
   including applicable requirements for corrective action set forth in Chapter

   5700.5. Existing hazardous substance UST systems which were installed or
   upgraded prior to November 12, 1993, and have complied with the new UST
   performance standards set forth in § 5701 shall be exempt from the
   requirements of § 5700.4.

   5700.6. New heating oil tanks, having a capacity of 1,100 gallons or more must

   through § 5706.

   5700.7. In addition to meeting the requirements of this chapter, the owner or

   systems.

   5700.8. In order to prevent releases due to structural failure, corrosion, or
   spills and overfills for as long as the UST system is used to store regulated
   substances, each owner or operator of an underground storage tank or UST
   system installed after December 22, 1988, shall ensure that each tank meets
   the applicable requirements set forth in this chapter.

   5700.9. Each tank shall be properly designed and constructed, and any portion
   underground that routinely contains a regulated substance shall be protected

   specified by the Director, and in accordance with the BOCA National Fire
   Prevention Code and the Fire Prevention Code and shall meet the requirements
   of this chapter.

   5700.10. Alternative tank construction and corrosion protection may be
   approved by the Director, if the tank construction and corrosion protection
   are determined by the Director to be designed to prevent the release or
   threatened release of any stored regulated substance in a manner that is no
   less protective of human health and the environment than the other provisions
   of this chapter.
