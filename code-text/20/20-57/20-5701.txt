                                  DC REGULATIONS

NEW PETROLEUM UST SYSTEMS (§ 20-5701)

5701.1. Except as provided in § 5700.10, each new petroleum underground
   storage tank, except for heating oil USTs, shall be constructed of:
   
   
   
   (a)	Fiberglass-reinforced plastic with double-walled construction or other
   secondary containment system as set forth in §§ 5701.4, 5701.5, and 5701.6;
   
   
   
   (b)	Steel-fiberglass-reinforced plastic composite with double wall
   construction or other secondary containment system as set forth in §§
   5701.4, 5701.5, and 5701.6; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Steel with double-walled construction or other secondary containment
   system as set forth in §§ 5701.4, 5701.5 and 5701.6, and the tank shall be
   cathodically protected in accordance with the requirements of § 5701.2.

   5701.2. Each steel tank shall be cathodically protected by being coated with a
   suitable dielectric material, and in addition:
   
   
   
   (a)	Field-installed cathodic protection systems shall be designed by a
   corrosion expert; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Impressed current cathodic protection systems shall be designed to allow
   determination of current operating status as required by § 5901.6.

   5701.3. Each cathodic protection system shall be operated and maintained in
   accordance with § 5901.

   5701.4. Secondary containment systems shall be designed, constructed, and
   installed to do the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Contain regulated substances released from the tank system until they are
   detected and removed;
   
   
   
   (b)	Prevent the release of regulated substances to the environment at any time
   during the operational life of the UST system; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Check for evidence of a release at least every thirty-(30) days.

   5701.5. Double-walled tanks shall be designed, constructed, and installed to
   do the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Contain a release from any portion of the inner tank within the outer
   wall; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Detect the failure of the inner wall.

   5701.6. External liner systems (including vaults) shall be designed,
   constructed, and installed to do the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Contain one hundred ten percent (110%) of the capacity of the largest tank
   within its boundary;
   
   
   
   (b)	Prevent the interference of precipitation or ground-water intrusion with
   the ability to contain or detect a release of regulated substances; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Surround the tank completely and be capable of preventing lateral, as well
   as vertical migration of regulated substances.

   5701.7. All new motor fuel dispenser systems shall contain under-dispenser
   containment.
   
   
   
   (a)	Under-dispenser containment shall be designed, constructed and installed
   to prevent leaks from the dispenser from reaching soil or groundwater. Such
   containment must:
   
   
   
   (1)	Be liquid-tight on its sides, bottom, and at any penetrations;
   
   
   
   (2)	Be compatible with the substance conveyed by the piping; and
   
   
   
   (3)	Allow for visual inspection and access to the components in the
   containment system and/or be monitored to detect a failure of the containment
   system.
