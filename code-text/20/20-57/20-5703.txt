NEW HEATING OIL UST SYSTEMS (§ 20-5703)

5703.1. Except as provided in § 5700.10, each new heating oil underground
   storage tank, having a capacity of one thousand and one hundred (1,100)
   gallons or more, installed after November 12, 1993, whether of single or
   double-walled construction, shall be constructed of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Fiberglass-reinforced plastic;
   
   
   
   (b)	Steel-fiberglass-reinforced plastic composite; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Steel and shall be cathodically protected in accordance with the
   requirements of § 5703.2.

   5703.2. Each steel tank shall be cathodically protected by being coated with a
   suitable dielectric material, and, in addition:
   
   
   
   (a)	Field-installed cathodic protection systems shall be designed by a
   corrosion expert; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Impressed current cathodic protection systems shall be designed to allow
   determination of current operating status as required by § 5901.6.

   5703.3. Each cathodic protection system shall be operated and maintained in
   accordance with § 5901.
   
   
   
   5703.4 	Secondary containment systems shall be designed, constructed, and
   installed to do the following:
   
   
   
   (a) 	Contain regulated substances released from the tank system until they are
   detected and removed;
   
   
   
   (b) 	Prevent the release of regulated substances to the environment at any
   time during the operational life of the UST system; and
   
   
   
   (c) 	In accordance with § 6003.5, check for evidence of a release at least
   every thirty (30) days.

   5703.5. Double-walled tanks shall be designed, constructed, and installed to
   do the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Contain a release from any portion of the inner tank within the outer
   wall; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Detect the failure of the inner wall.

   5703.6. External liner systems (including vaults) shall be designed,
   constructed, and installed to do the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Contain one hundred ten percent (110%) of the capacity of the largest tank
   within its boundary;
   
   
   
   (b)	Prevent the interference of precipitation or ground water intrusion with
   the ability to contain or detect a release of regulated substances; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Surround the tank completely and be capable of preventing lateral, as well
   as vertical migration of regulated substances.
