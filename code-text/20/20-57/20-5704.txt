                                  DC REGULATIONS

NEW PIPING FOR UST SYSTEMS (§ 20-5704)

5704.1. The piping that routinely contains regulated substances and is in
   contact with earthen materials shall be properly designed, constructed, and
   protected from corrosion in accordance with a code of practice developed by a
   nationally recognized association or independent testing laboratory, as
   specified by the Director.

   5704.2. Except as provided in § 5704.7, underground storage tank system
   piping shall be constructed of:
   
   
   
   (a)	Fiberglass-reinforced plastic;
   
   
   
   (b)	Steel and shall be cathodically protected in accordance with the
   requirements of § 5901; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Other materials approved by the Director in accordance with § 5704.8.

   5704.3. Steel UST piping shall be cathodically protected by being coated with
   a suitable dielectric material, and, in addition:
   
   
   
   (a)	Field-installed cathodic protection systems shall be designed by a
   corrosion expert; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Impressed current cathodic protection systems shall be designed to allow
   determination of current operating status as required by § 5901.6.

   5704.4. Each cathodic protection system shall be operated and maintained in
   accordance with § 5901.

   5704.5. Except as provided in § 5704.7, underground piping for hazardous
   substance USTs, and pressurized underground piping and non-safe suction piping
   for all petroleum USTs, shall be equipped with secondary containment features
   that are designed and constructed in compliance with the requirements of §
   5701.4 of this chapter.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Suction piping that does not comply with the requirements of § 6004.8 (a)
   through (e), shall be considered non-safe suction piping.

   5704.6. For the purposes of this section, &#8220;pressurized underground
   piping&#8221; includes pressurized supply lines, return lines, and remote fill
   lines.

   5704.7. Secondary containment shall not be required for vent pipes, Stage II
   vapor recovery pipes, vertical fill pipes, or piping for hazardous substance
   USTs used for industrial use.

   5704.8. Other materials and construction techniques may be used for UST piping
   if the piping construction and corrosion protection are determined by the
   Director to be designed to prevent the release or threatened release of any
   stored regulated substance in a manner that is no less protective of human
   health and the environment than the other provisions of this section.
