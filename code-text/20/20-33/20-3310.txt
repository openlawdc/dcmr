                                  DC REGULATIONS

RENOVATION REQUIREMENTS (§ 20-3310)

3310.1. Except as provided in § 3310.3, an individual, firm, or business
   entity that performs renovation of a residential property or a child-occupied
   facility built prior to 1978 and that is compensated for those services shall
   obtain a renovation permit from DDOE, if:
   
   
   
   (a)	The activities contracted for include the removal, repair, or paint
   stripping  	of surfaces or building components coated with presumed or
   identified 	lead-based paint, including weatherization projects that disturb
   surfaces or 	building components coated with presumed or identified lead-based
   paint, 	the sum total of which activities disturbs more than five hundred
   square 	feet (500 sq. ft.) of painted surface; or
   
   
   
   (b)	The contract for the renovation work contains a total charged cost of
   	twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) or more for the specific activities
   	enumerated in § 3310.1(a).

   3310.2. The raze or demolition of a building, which is subject to § 3316.4,
   shall not trigger a requirement for a DDOE-issued renovation permit.

   3310.3. A renovation permit shall not be required for renovations in
   residential housing or child-occupied facilities built prior to 1978, in
   which:
   
   
   
   (a)	A written determination has been made by a certified lead-based paint
   	inspector or a certified risk assessor that the components affected by the
   	renovation are free of paint or other surface coatings that contain lead
   	equal to or in excess of one milligram per square centimeter (1.0 mg/ cm2)
   	or one half percent (0.5%) by weight, where the firm performing the
   	renovation has obtained a copy of the determination;
   
   
   
   (b)	A certified renovator, using an EPA-recognized test kit as defined in 40
   	CFR § 745.83 and following the kit manufacturer’s instructions, has tested
   	each component affected by the renovation and determined that the 	components
   are free of paint or other surface coatings that contain lead 	equal to or in
   excess of one milligram per square centimeter (1.0 mg/ cm2) 	or one half
   percent (0.5%) by weight, with the understanding that if the 	components make
   up an integrated whole, such as the individual stair 	treads and risers of a
   single staircase, the renovator is required to test only 	one of the
   individual components, unless the individual components 	appear to have been
   repainted or refinished separately; or
   
   
   
   (c)	A certified renovator has collected a paint chip sample from each painted
   	component affected by the renovation and a laboratory recognized by EPA
   	pursuant to Section 405(b) of the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976,
   	effective October 11, 1976, as amended (Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003; 15
   	USC 2685(b)), as being capable of performing analyses for lead 	compounds in
   paint chip samples has determined that the samples are free 	of paint or other
   surface coatings that contain lead equal to or in excess of 	one milligram per
   square centimeter (1.0 mg/ cm2) or one half percent 	(0.5%) by weight, with
   the understanding that if the components make up 	an integrated whole, such as
   the individual stair treads and risers of a 	single staircase, the renovator
   is required to test only one of the individual 	components, unless the
   individual components appear to have been 	repainted or refinished separately.

   3310.4. A clearance examination shall be performed after the work has been
   done that required a renovation permit, which in the case of work in a vacant
   unit shall be at any point prior to re-occupancy of the unit:
   
   
   
   (a)	A clearance examination triggered pursuant to this section
   or § 3316.2(a), 	or pursuant to any provision under 40 CFR § 745.85, shall
   consist of dust 	sampling in each room that contains a work area, on the
   following 	surfaces in each sampled room:
   
   
   
   (1)	One (1) floor sample; and
   
   
   
   (2)	For rooms that contain a window, one (1) window sill or one (1) 	window
   well sample;
   
   
   
   (b)	For work that involves door replacement in accordance with § 3316.2(a),
   	the floor samples shall be taken within two feet (2 ft.) of any such door,
   	but no window sample shall be required;
   
   
   
   (c)	Whenever a work area is located on the exterior of a property, and
   	whenever a work area involves a window or a door that opens to the 	exterior
   of a property, a dust sample shall be taken on any concrete or 	other rough
   exterior horizontal surface within the work area(s);
   
   
   
   (d)	A clearance examination performed after covering of soil pursuant to
   	§ 3316.2(b) shall consist of a determination by the lead-based paint
   	inspector or risk assessor conducting the clearance examination as to
   	whether the lead-contaminated soil was uniformly covered by at least six
   	inches (6 in.) of clean soil or other appropriate ground cover, and a
   	description in the clearance report of the methodology used by said
   	inspector or risk assessor to make this determination; and
   
   
   
   (e)	A clearance examination shall be performed no sooner than one (1) hour
   	and no later than three (3) business days after the completion of the
   	activities conducted pursuant to the permit or other activities listed in
   §§ 	3316.2(a) and (b), or in the case of work in a vacant unit, at any point
   prior 	to re-occupancy of the unit.

   3310.5. Each environmental sample taken pursuant to this section shall be
   submitted for analysis to an appropriately accredited lab.

   3310.8. Each clearance report shall contain a copy of the current DDOE-issued
   certification card belonging to the individual that conducted the clearance

   3310.9. Except as provided in § 3310.10, all work that constitutes renovation
   work pursuant to 40 CFR § 745.80 et seq. and that does not trigger a permit
   requirement under these regulations shall be conducted in accordance with the
   rules promulgated by EPA under 40 CFR § 745.85(a) and shall be followed by
   cleaning verification or a clearance examination in accordance with the rules
   promulgated by EPA under 40 CFR § 745.85(b).

   (a)	Renovation activities that were not planned but result from a sudden,
   	unexpected event, such as non-routine failures of equipment, that, if not
   	immediately attended to, presents a safety or public health hazard, or
   	threatens equipment and/or property with significant damage; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Interim controls performed in response to an elevated blood lead level in
   a 	resident child.

   3310.13. Renovation firms shall comply with all recordkeeping and reporting
