                                  DC REGULATIONS

NOTICE OF VIOLATION OR NOTICE OF INFRACTION, AND ORDER TO ELIMINATE LEAD-BASED
PAINT HAZARDS (§ 20-3318)

3318.1. DDOE may take steps to determine the existence of a lead-based paint
   hazard whenever DDOE has reason to believe that there is a risk that a
   lead-based paint hazard is present in a dwelling unit, an accessible common
   area of a multifamily property, or a child-occupied facility such as a day
   care center or kindergarten program that is regularly attended by children
   under the age of six (6) years constructed prior to 1978.

   3318.2. To determine whether a lead-based paint hazard is present, DDOE’s
   investigation of a dwelling unit, accessible common area, or a child-occupied
   facility pursuant to § 3318.1 shall be followed by a report to the owner and
   the tenant, and may include:
   
   
   
   (a)	A visual inspection; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Any other form of lead hazard evaluation.

   3318.3. If a lead-based paint hazard is identified, DDOE may issue a written
   Notice of Violation or Notice of Infraction, and an Order to Eliminate
   Lead-Based Paint Hazards (collectively “Notice and Order”), to the
   property owner or to any other person. A Notice and Order shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	Identify the violation;
   
   
   
   (b)	Specify the measures needed to correct the violation, including the time
   	for compliance;
   
   
   
   (c)	Order any other action necessary to protect the health and safety of the
   	occupants, including relocation pursuant to § 3319, if necessary;
   
   
   
   (d)	Include an invoice charging the recipient of the Notice and Order for the
   	costs associated with the risk assessment that resulted in the identification
   	of lead-based paint hazards; and
   
   
   
   (e)	In the case of a Notice of Infraction, include an assessment of a fine for
   	each violation being cited.

   3318.4. An owner, individual, firm, or business entity may object to a notice
   or order by requesting a hearing within fifteen (15) calendar days of service.
    If service is by first class mail, a request for a hearing may be filed
   within twenty (20) days of service.  If specific instructions are not on the
   notice or order, the owner, individual, firm, or entity shall file a written
   request for a hearing, including the grounds for the objection, in accordance
   with Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Office of Administrative Hearings
   set forth in Title 1 DCMR Chapter 28.

   3318.5. If DDOE orders the owner to eliminate a hazard by lead-based paint
   hazard abatement, the owner shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	Comply with the DDOE Order within thirty (30) calendar days of its
   	receipt, in conformance with D.C. Official Code § 8-231.15(a) unless
   	extended for good cause pursuant to § 3318.9;
   
   
   
   (b)	Obtain a permit pursuant to § 3316 before beginning abatement work;
   
   
   
   (c)	Ensure that each person performing an abatement activity:
   
   
   
   (1)	Is certified as required by this chapter; and
   
   
   
   (2)	Adheres to the lead-safe work practice requirements under § 3302 	while
   performing the work; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Submit a copy of the clearance report to DDOE and, in the case of rental
   	housing, a copy to the tenant, that:
   
   
   
   (1)	Has been prepared by a risk assessor, subject to the conditions in 	D.C.
   Official Code § 8-231.11(f)(1);
   
   
   
   (2)	Is submitted to DDOE and to the tenant within seven (7) business 	days of
   its issuance by said risk assessor; and
   
   
   
   (3)	Complies with the clearance report requirements established under 	§
   3318.7.

   3318.6. If DDOE allows the owner to apply interim controls because abatement
   is not deemed essential to eliminate a hazard given the particular
   circumstances, the owner shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	Comply with the DDOE Order within thirty (30) calendar days of its
   	receipt, in conformance with D.C. Official Code § 8-231.15(a), unless
   	extended for good cause pursuant to § 3318.9;
   
   
   
   (b)	Ensure that each person working to eliminate the lead-based paint hazard:
   
   
   
   (1)	Is certified as required by this chapter; or
   
   
   
   (2)	Has been trained in the lead-safe work practices established under 	§
   3302; and
   
   
   
   (3)	Adheres to those lead-safe work practices while performing the 	work;
   
   
   
   (c)	Comply with the rules for application of interim controls under § 3315;
   	and
   
   
   
   (d)	Submit a clearance report to DDOE, and in the case of rental housing, to
   	the tenant, that:
   
   
   
   (1)	Has been prepared by a risk assessor, subject to the conditions in 	D.C.
   Official Code § 8-231.11(f)(1), except as otherwise provided 	in § 3315.5;

   days of its issuance by the individual who signed the 	report; and
   
   
   
   (3)	Complies with the clearance report requirements under § 3318.7 	and, if
   applicable, under § 3315.4.

   3318.7. If DDOE has issued an Order to Eliminate Lead-Based Paint Hazards, the
   clearance examination shall be performed no sooner than one (1) hour after the
   completion of lead-based paint hazard control activities, and no later than
   three (3) business days after completion, and shall be performed as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	The clearance examination shall include the following:

   (2)	Photos to document that each work area where non-intact paint 	conditions
   had been identified in the Notice and Order has been 	made intact;
   
   
   
   (3)	A visual inspection of each work area to ensure there is no visible 	dust
   or debris;
   
   
   
   (4)	Dust sampling in each room that contains a work area, and if fewer 	than
   four (4) rooms contain a work area, in additional rooms until 	at least four
   (4) rooms are sampled, that shall include either a 	child’s bedroom, a
   children’s play room, a living room, the 	bathroom used by the child, or the

   two feet (2 ft.) of the rear door of each unit where 	lead-based paint hazard
   elimination work occurred, provided the 	rear door does not open up to the
   property exterior; and
   
   
   
   (8)	Soil sampling if lead-contaminated bare soil was identified, or if
   	exterior work to eliminate a lead-based paint hazard was 	performed within
