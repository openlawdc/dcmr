LEAD-SAFE WORK PRACTICES[COLON] GENERAL (§ 20-3302)

3302.1. Except as provided in § 3303, or if a dwelling unit qualifies as a
   “lead-free unit” in accordance with either § 3314.5, § 3314.6 or §
   3314.7, any individual, firm or entity engaged in an activity that disturbs a
   painted surface and that by so doing may generate a lead-based paint hazard,
   such as paint chips, dust, or debris, shall use lead-safe work practices as

   exterior surfaces of a dwelling unit or a child-occupied facility, if there is
   a danger of lead-based paint hazards being generated.

   them with plastic whose seams and edges are taped or otherwise 	sealed;
   
   
   
   (c)	Post signs that clearly define each work area, warn occupants and others
   	who are not involved in the work to remain outside of the work area, to the
   	extent practicable are in the primary language of the occupants, are posted

   (h)	Close all windows and doors in the work area;
   
   
   
   (i)	For interior work, the secure covering shall extend at least six feet (6
   ft.) 	beyond the perimeter of surfaces where work that disturbs painted
   surfaces 	is taking place;
   
   
   
   (j)	For exterior work, cover the soil, grass, or concrete with a taped-down or
   	otherwise secured plastic sheeting or other disposable impermeable 	material
   that will not tear easily, and extend the covering to at least ten 	feet (10
   ft.) beyond the perimeter of surfaces where work that disturbs 	painted
   surfaces is taking place;
   
   
   
   (k)	For work that will affect surfaces within ten feet (10 ft.) of the
   property 	line, erect vertical containment or equivalent extra precautions in
   	containing the work area to ensure that dust and debris from the work does
   	not contaminate adjacent buildings or migrate to adjacent properties;
   
   
   
   (l)	Isolate interior work areas so that no dust or debris leaves the work
   areas 	while work is being performed, while ensuring that such containment
   does 	not interfere with occupant and worker egress in case of an emergency;
   
   
   
   (m)	Maintain the integrity of the containment by ensuring that any plastic
   	sheeting or other impermeable materials are not torn or displaced;
   
   
   
   (n)	For exterior work, close all doors and windows within twenty feet (20 ft.)
   	of any area where work that disturbs painted surfaces is taking place, and
   	on multi-story buildings, close all doors and windows within twenty feet 	(20
   ft.) of such work area on the same floor as the work area, and close all
   	doors and windows on all floors below that are the same horizontal 	distance
   from the work area;
   
   
   
   (o)	Take reasonable measures to ensure all work clothes, shoes, tools, and

   	and debris before workers exit or items are removed from the work area;
   
   
   
   (p)	Cover doors located within the area of containment with plastic so that
   	workers can pass through, while confining dust and debris to the work 	area;
   
   
   
   (q)	Take the necessary precautions in containing the work area to ensure no
   	dust or debris leaves the work area while work is being performed or
   	contaminates other buildings or other areas of the property or migrates 	over
   to neighboring properties or structures;
   
   
   
   (r)	Use a spray bottle to mist any painted surfaces with water prior to

   (v)	At the end of each work day and at the conclusion of all work, store all
   	waste that has been collected under containment in an enclosure or behind 	a
   barrier that prevents release of dust and debris out of the work area and
   	that prevents access to dust and debris;
   
   
   
   (w)	Cover any chute, if one is used to remove waste from the work area, to
   	prevent any of the waste from escaping and dispersing;
