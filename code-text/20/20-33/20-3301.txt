                                  DC REGULATIONS

PRESUMPTION OF LEAD-BASED PAINT AND LEAD-BASED PAINT HAZARDS (ยง 20-3301)

3301.1. The interior and exterior of dwelling units and child-occupied
   facilities are presumed to contain lead-based paint if constructed prior to
   1978, and any paint that is deteriorated, chipping, peeling, or otherwise not
   in intact condition is considered to be a lead-based paint hazard and is
   prohibited.

   3301.2. This presumption may be rebutted by a lead-based paint inspection
   report, prepared by a lead-based paint inspector or a risk assessor, which
   documents that the paint in question is not lead-based paint.

   3301.3. The presence of deteriorated paint in residential premises and
   child-occupied facilities constructed prior to 1978, which constitutes a
   lead-based paint hazard if no documentation is produced proving it is not
   lead-based paint, shall trigger enforcement action.
