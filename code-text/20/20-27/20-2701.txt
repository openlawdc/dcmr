   restrictive noise limitation than that from which the noise emanates, the
   sound level measurement at the zone line shall not exceed that established for
   the more restrictive zone.

   2701.5. If the sound emanates from a source within an area for which the
   maximum permissible sound level has not been established, the maximum level
   shall be sixty (60) dB (A).

   2701.6. Unless restricted by another section of Chapters 27 and 28 of this
   subtitle, sounds emanating from a street or highway shall not exceed the most
