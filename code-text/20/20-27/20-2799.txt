   in the Act.
   
   
   
   Noise disturbance &#8211; any sound which is loud and raucous or loud and
   unseemly and unreasonably disturbs the peace and quiet of a reasonable person
   of ordinary sensibilities in the vicinity thereof, unless the making and
   continuing of the noise is necessary for the protection or preservation of the
   health, safety, life, or limb of some person. In making a determination of a
   noise disturbance, the Mayor shall consider the location, the time of day when
   the noise is occurring or will occur, the duration of the noise.  In addition,
   the Mayor may consider the magnitude of the noise relative to the maximum
   sound levels permitted under this act, the possible obstruction or
   interference with vehicular or pedestrian traffic, the number of people that
   are or would be affected, and such other factors as are reasonably related to
   the impact of the noise on the health, safety, welfare, peace, and quiet of
   the community.  A noise shall not be considered a noise disturbance if it is
   made during noncommercial public speaking during the daytime and does not
   exceed 80 decibels inside the nearest occupied residence in districts zoned
   R-1A, R-1B, R-2, R-3, or R-4. Except as it may otherwise conflict with
   provisions of this act, all measurements of noise levels shall be performed
   and verified by qualified inspectors of the Department of Consumer and
   Regulatory Affairs in accordance with the requirements specified in Chapter 29
   of Title 20 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations. If the noise is
   made at night or does not involve noncommercial public speaking, the Mayor
   shall not be required to measure the decibel level of the noise to find a
   noise disturbance.
