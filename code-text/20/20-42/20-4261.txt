   (a)	Where the Director, in carrying out his or her responsibilities under § 8

   Facility Permit Amendment Act of 1998, D.C. Official Code § 8-1055(c)(12)

   4261.7. The provisions of 40 CFR § 261.5 (special requirements for hazardous

   small quantity generator waste and used oil shall be regulated as hazardous

   (1)	Any measures taken during the previous year to reduce the volume and
   toxicity of hazardous waste generated; and,
   
   
   
   (2)	To the extent such information is available, any changes in the volume and
   toxicity actually achieved during the year in comparison to previous years.

   4261.8. Except for 40 CFR § 261.20(c), in which the term
   &#8220;Director&#8221; shall supplant the term &#8220;Administrator,&#8221;
