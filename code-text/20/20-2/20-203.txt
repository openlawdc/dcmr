                                  DC REGULATIONS

STACK HEIGHT AND DISPERSION TECHNIQUES (§ 20-203)

203.1. The emission limitation for any pollutant required of any source shall
   not be affected by the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Any source&#8217;s stack height that exceeds GEP stack height, with GEP
   stack height meaning the greater of the following:
   
   
   
   (1)	Sixty-five (65) meters (two hundred thirteen feet (213 ft.));
   
   
   
   (2)	Hg = H + 1.5L, with the equation parameters described in the definition of
   &#8220;dispersion technique&#8221; in § 199.1 of this subtitle; or
   
   
   
   (3)	The height demonstrated by a fluid model or a field study approved by the
   Director, which ensures that the emissions from the stack do not result in
   excessive concentrations of any air pollutant as a result of atmospheric
   downwash, wakes, or eddy effects created by the source itself, nearby
   structures or nearby terrain features; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Any other dispersion technique, except as provided in § 203.4.

   203.2. For purposes of modeling to establish emission limitations, the lesser
   of the physical stack height and the following measurements shall be used:
   
   
   
   (a)	Sixty-five (65) meters (two hundred thirteen feet (213 ft.));
   
   
   
   (b)	Hg = H + 1.5L, with the equation parameters described in the definition of
   &#8220;dispersion technique&#8221; in § 199.1 of this subtitle; or
   
   
   
   (c)	The height demonstrated by a fluid model or a field study approved by the
   Director, which ensures that the emissions from the stack do not result in
   excessive concentrations of any air pollutant as a result of atmospheric
   downwash, wakes, or eddy effects created by the source itself, nearby
   structures or nearby terrain features.

   203.3. In determining whether a demonstration is performed satisfactorily, the
   Mayor shall take into consideration, among other factors, the methods,
   documents, and practices used in performing the demonstration.

   203.4. The provisions of §§ 203.1 and 203.2 shall not apply to stack heights
   in existence, or dispersion techniques implemented prior to December 31, 1970,
   except when a source proposes to connect to a stack built prior to December
   31, 1970.

   203.5. Before the Mayor issues a permit to a source based on a GEP stack
   height that exceeds the height allowed by § 203.1(a)(1) or 203.1(a)(2), the
   Mayor shall notify the public of the availability of the demonstration study
   and shall hold a public hearing on the study if a hearing is requested within
   thirty (30) days of the date on which the Mayor gives notice of the study.

   203.6. Section 203 shall not restrict, in any manner, the actual stack height
   of any source; however, the actual stack height of a source may be regulated
   under this chapter.
