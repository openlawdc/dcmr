PERMIT REQUIREMENTS FOR SOURCES AFFECTINGNON-ATTAINMENT AREAS (§ 20-204)

204.1. This section shall apply to theconstruction of any new major stationary
   source or any majormodification at an existing major stationary source in an
   areadesignated as nonattainment under Â§ 107(d)(1)(A)(i) ofthe Clean Air
   Act.

   204.2. Permit applications submitted pursuant tothis section shall include a
   control technology evaluation todemonstrate that any new major stationary
   source or majormodification will meet the lowest achievable emission rate
   (LAER)for all new or modified emissions units, unless otherwise providedin
   this section.

   204.3. Any permit application submitted pursuantto this section shall provide
   for creditable emission reductionoffsets pursuant to this section. The
   application shall providedocumentation adequate for the Department to assess
   the validity ofthe proposed offsets.

   204.4. Any new major stationary source or majormodification to be constructed
   in an area designated asnonattainment shall comply with LAER as determined by
   theDepartment and set forth in a preconstruction permit issuedpursuant to this
   section.

   204.5. Any new major stationary source or majormodification to be constructed
   in a nonattainment area shall notbegin actual construction without a permit
   issued by the Departmentthat incorporates the applicable control technology
   and offsetrequirements as specified in Â§ 204.18 and204.19.

   204.6. Before applying for a permit to construct,the owner or operator shall
   determine applicability pursuant to theprovisions below and submit this
   determination with the permitapplication: (a) A project is a major
   modification for a regulatedNSR pollutant as defined in Â§ 299; (b)
   Determine whetherthe emissions increases from the project are significant as
   definedin Â§ 299 by summing the potential to emit from each newemissions
   unit and the difference between the potential to emit foreach existing unit
   affected by the project after the change and theactual emissions prior to the
   change; (c) Determine whether theproject results in a significant net
   emissions increase as definedin Â§ 299; (d) An emissions unit is considered
   affectedby the project if an emissions increase from the unit would occuras a
   result of the project, regardless of whether a physical changeor change in the
   method of operation will occur at the particularemissions unit; and (e)
   Subsection 204.17 pertains to projects thatresult in a significant increase in
   a regulated NSR pollutant, butdo not result in a significant net emissions
   increase.

   204.7. Any major stationary source subject to aPlantwide Applicability Limit
   (PAL) for a regulated NSR pollutantshall comply with the requirements set
   forth in Â§208.

   204.8. For sources and modifications subject toany preconstruction review
   program, the baseline for determiningcredit for emissions reductions is the
   emissions limit under theState Implementation Plan in effect at the time the
   application toconstruct is filed, except that the offset baseline shall be
   theactual emissions of the source from which offset credit is obtainedwhere:
   (a) The demonstration of reasonable further progress andattainment of ambient
   air quality standards is based upon theactual emissions of sources located
   within the designatednonattainment area; or (b) The State Implementation Plan
   does notcontain an emissions limitation for that source or sourcecategory.

   204.9. In determining offset credits, thefollowing provisions shall also
   apply: (a) Where the emissionslimit under the State Implementation Plan
   provides for greateremissions than the potential to emit of the source, offset
   creditswill be granted only for control below the potential to emit; (b)For an
   existing fuel combustion source, credit shall be based onthe allowable
   emissions under the applicable State ImplementationPlan for the type of fuel
   being burned at the time the applicationto construct is filed: (1) If the
   existing source commits to switchto a cleaner fuel at some future date,
   emissions offset creditbased on the allowable (or actual) emissions for the
   fuels involvedis not acceptable, unless the permit is conditioned to require
   theuse of a specified alternative control measure which would achievethe same
   degree of emissions reduction should the source switchback to a dirtier fuel
   at some later date; and (2) The Departmentshould ensure that adequate
   long-term supplies of the new fuel areavailable before granting emissions
   offset credit for fuelswitches; and (c) Emissions reductions achieved by
   shutting down anexisting source or curtailing production or operating hours
   belowbaseline levels may be generally credited if such reductions aresurplus,
   permanent, quantifiable, and federally enforceable: (1)The shutdown or
   curtailment is creditable only if it occurred on orafter the date of the most
   recent emissions inventory used in theplan&#8217;s demonstration of
   attainment, unless an earlier cutoff datehas been specified in the plan; (2)
   In no event may credit be givenfor shutdowns that occurred prior to August 7,
   1977; and (3) Forpurposes of this subsection, the Department may choose to
   considera prior shutdown or curtailment to have occurred after the date ofits
   most recent emissions inventory, if the inventory explicitlyincludes as
   current existing emissions the emissions from suchpreviously shutdown or
   curtailed sources.

   204.10. No emissions credit may be allowed forreplacing one (1) hydrocarbon
   compound with another of lesserreactivity, except for those compounds listed
   in Table 1 of EPA&#8217;s&#8221;Recommended Policy on Control of Volatile
   Organic Compounds,&#8221; 42Fed. Reg. 35314 (July 8, 1977).

   204.11. All emission reductions claimed for offsetcredit shall be federally
   enforceable.

   204.12. Procedures relating to the permissiblelocation of offsetting emissions
   shall be followed which are atleast as stringent as those set out in 40 C.F.R.
   part 51, appendixS, Â§ IV.D.

   204.13. Credit for an emissions reduction can beclaimed to the extent that the
   Department has not relied on it inissuing any permit under regulations
   approved pursuant to 40 C.F.R.part 51, subpart I, or the District has not
   relied on it indemonstrating attainment or reasonable further progress.

   204.14. The total tonnage of increased emissions,in tons per year, resulting
   from a major modification that must beoffset in accordance with Â§ 173 of
   the Clean Air Actshall be determined by summing the difference between the
   allowableemissions after the modification and the actual emissions beforethe
   modification for each emissions unit.

   204.15. The provisions of Â§ 204 do notapply to a source or modification
   that would be a major stationarysource or major modification only if fugitive
   emissions to theextent quantifiable are considered in calculating the
   potential toemit of the stationary source or modification and the source
   doesnot belong to any of the categories listed under the definition ofmajor
   stationary source in Â§ 199.1.

   204.16. The following provisions apply to anyowner or operator subject to the
   air quality regulations of thistitle: (a) Approval to construct shall not
   relieve any owner oroperator of the responsibility to comply fully with
   applicableprovisions of the State Implementation Plan and any
   otherrequirements under local, state or federal law; and (b) At suchtime that
   a particular source or modification becomes a majorstationary source or major
   modification solely by virtue of arelaxation in any enforceable limitation
   which was establishedafter August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or
   modificationotherwise to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours
   ofoperation, then the requirements of this section shall apply to thesource or
   modification as though construction had not yet commencedon the source or
   modification.

   204.17. For any project that would result in asignificant emissions increase,
   but is not considered a majormodification: (a) Before submitting a permit
   application for such aproject, the owner or operator shall document and
   maintain a recordof the following information: (1) A description of the
   project; (2)Identification of the emissions unit(s) whose emissions of
   aregulated NSR pollutant could be affected by the project; and (3)The
   applicability analysis used to determine the project is not amajor
   modification for any regulated NSR pollutant, including theactual emissions,
   the potential to emit after the project, and thenetting analysis; (b) The
   owner or operator shall provide a copy ofthe information set out in paragraph
   (a) to the Department with apermit application submitted pursuant to Â§
   200.1; and(c) The owner or operator of the source shall make the
   informationrequired in paragraph (a) available for review upon
   theDepartmentâ€™s request.

   204.18. The permit shall require that in meetingthe emissions offset
   requirements for ozone nonattainment areas,the ratio of total actual emission
   reductions of VOC or NOX to theemissions increase of VOC or NOX shall be at
   least one and threetenths to one (1.3:1).

   204.19. The permit shall require that in meetingthe emissions offset
   requirements for all other nonattainmentareas, the ratio of total actual
   emission reductions of anypollutant to the emissions increase of that
   pollutant shall be atleast one to one (1:1).

   204.20. Requirements of this chapter applicable tomajor stationary sources and
   major modifications of PM10 shall alsoapply to major stationary sources and
   major modifications of PM10precursors, except where the Administrator
   determines that suchsources do not contribute significantly to PM10 levels
   that exceedthe PM10 ambient standards in the area.

   204.21. In meeting the emissions offsetrequirements of Â§ 204.8 through
   204.14, the emissionsoffsets obtained shall be for the same regulated NSR
   pollutant,except as provided in Â§ 204.22.

   204.22. The Department may allow the offsetrequirements in Â§ 204.8 through
   204.14 for direct PM2.5emissions or precursors of PM2.5 to be satisfied by
   offsettingreductions in direct PM2.5 emissions or emissions of any
   PM2.5precursor, using a ratio approved by the Department followingpublic
   notice and comment and approval by EPA.Â SOURCE:Section 3 of the District of
