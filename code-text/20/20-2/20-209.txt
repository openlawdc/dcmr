                                  DC REGULATIONS

PERMIT REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-MAJOR STATIONARY SOURCES (MINOR NEW SOURCE REVIEW)
(§ 20-209)

209.1. Effective January 1, 2014, except as specified in § 209.2, the
   requirements of this section are applicable to any source required to obtain a
   permit under § 200 to construct a new stationary source, modify an existing
   stationary source, or install or modify an air pollution control device on a
   stationary source that results in collateral emission increases, for a project
   that:
   
   
   
   (a)	Is not required to comply with the requirements of either § 204 or §
   208; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Results in an increase of the potential to emit rate equal to or greater
   than five tons per year (5 Tpy) from an individual unit of any of the
   following:
   
   
   
   (1)	Total volatile organic compounds (VOCs);
   
   
   
   (2)	Nitrogen oxides (NOx);
   
   
   
   (3)	Sulfur dioxide (SO2);
   
   
   
   (4)	Particulate matter less than ten (10) microns in aerodynamic diameter
   (PM10);
   
   
   
   (5)	Fine particulate matter less than two and a half (2.5) microns in
   aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5); and
   
   
   
   (6)	An aggregate of any of the hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) listed in §
   112(b) of the Clean Air Act.

   209.2. Any source applying for a permit under § 200 not meeting the
   applicability requirements specified in § 209.1 shall submit, with their
   application, sufficient documentation to show that the proposed source does
   not meet those applicability requirements.

   209.3. Any source meeting the applicability requirements specified in § 209.1
   shall, relative to each pollutant for which it meets the applicability
   requirement, be controlled by operating emission control technologies or
   pollution prevention methodologies that limit emissions to the atmosphere
   meeting one (1) or more of the following requirements:
   
   
   
   (a)	The lowest achievable emission rate (LAER);
   
   
   
   (b)	The best available control technology (BACT);
   
   
   
   (c)	For an air contaminant that is a HAP, the requirements of a maximum
   achievable control technology (MACT) or other standard resulting from a
   residual risk determination promulgated under 40 C.F.R. part 63 or, where
   applicable, a more stringent standard adopted under this title;
   
   
   
   (d)	An emission control technology or pollution prevention methodology
   approved in advance by the Department for a similar source pursuant to this
   section; or
   
   
   
   (e)	An emission control technology or pollution prevention methodology
   approved by the Department, on a case-by-case basis, pursuant to § 209.4.

   209.4. A case-by-case determination pursuant to § 209.3(e) shall be performed
   by completing the following steps:
   
   
   
   (a)	Identify and evaluate a list of air pollution technologies and pollution
   prevention methodologies that may be applied to the source including, but not
   limited to, technologies and methodologies used for similar sources,
   innovative control technologies, modification of the process or process
   equipment, other pollution prevention measures, and combinations of the above
   measures;
   
   
   
   (b)	Arrange the measures on the list in descending order of air pollution
   control effectiveness; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Chose and propose the top-rated measure on the list not eliminated from
   consideration as a result of one (1) of the following demonstrations:
   
   
   
   (1)	Where a demonstration can be and is made that this measure is technically
   infeasible, based on physical, chemical, or engineering principles, and/or
   technical difficulties that would prevent the successful application of the
   measure;
   
   
   
   (2)	Where a demonstration can be and is made that this measure has adverse
   environmental effects (for example effects on water or land, HAP emissions, or
   increased environmental hazards) when compared with its air contaminant
   emission reduction benefits, which would make use of this measure
   unreasonable;
   
   
   
   (3)	Where a demonstration can be and is made that this measure should be
   eliminated from consideration based on its calculated economic impacts using
   the techniques in the latest edition of EPA’s Control Cost Manual, where the
   total and incremental costs of the top measure are greater than the total and
   incremental costs of the proposed measure(s) and that the extra costs, when
   compared with the air contaminant emission reduction benefits resulting from
   the top measure would make use of the top measure unreasonable; or
   
   
   
   (4)	Where a demonstration can be and is made that this measure should be
   eliminated from consideration based on its energy impacts such as
   establishment that it relies on fuels that are not reliably available; or that
   the energy consumed by the top measure is greater than that consumed by the
   proposed measure(s), and that the extra energy used, when compared with the
   air contaminant emission reduction benefits resulting from the top measure
   would make use of that measure unreasonable.

   209.5. Any application submitted pursuant to the requirements of this section
   shall contain the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The control technology or pollution prevention methodology proposed to be
   installed and operated to meet the requirements of § 209.3;
   
   
   
   (b)	The list, if this method was chosen, generated pursuant to § 209.4;
   
   
   
   (c)	Any demonstration(s) performed pursuant to § 209.4(c); and
   
   
   
   (d)	Any additional information that the Department requests in order to
   complete an evaluation of the proposal.
