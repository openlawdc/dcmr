   UST system shall comply with the requirements of this section.

   6100.3. A heating oil tank shall not be deemed temporarily closed until

   the District of Columbia Fire Chief by submitting an amended notification form
   within seven (7) days of the date the UST system is temporarily closed.

   6100.5. During the period when an UST system is temporarily closed, but still
   contains regulated substance, the owner or operator shall continue the
   operation and maintenance of corrosion protection in accordance with § 5901
   and release detection in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 60.

   (a)	Remove all regulated substances from the UST system and keep the UST
   system empty for the balance of the temporary closure period. The UST system
   shall be deemed to be empty when all substances have been removed using
   commonly employed practices so that either of the following is achieved:
   
   
   
   (1)	No more than two and one-half centimeters (2.5 cm) of residue remains in
   the UST system; or

   (b)	Ensure that all vent lines are open and functioning;
   
   
   
   (c)	Cap and secure all other lines, pumps, manways, and ancillary equipment;

   completed Contractor Certification form:
   
   
   
   (1)	Signed by the independent third-party service provider who performed the
   activities stated in § 6100.7(a) through (c); or
   
   
   
   (2)	Signed by an independent third-party service provider who has inspected
   and verified that the owner or operator performed the activities stated in §
   6100.7(a) through (c).

   6100.8. Except as provided in §§ 6100.9 and 6100.10, the owner or operator

   6100.10. The Director in his or her discretion may approve a request for
   extension of the twelve (12) month temporary closure period for additional
   twelve (12) month periods. In making this determination, the Director may
   consider the reasons for the original temporary closure, the reasons for the
   request for extension, the nature of the site and the surrounding
   neighborhood, the potential for harm to the environment from an extended
   temporary closure and delayed reopening of the UST system, the potential for
   abandonment of the site, and other relevant factors.
