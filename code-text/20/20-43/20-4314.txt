   time period:
   
   
   
   (1)	Judicial action may be instituted;
   
   
   
   (2)	A tax lien on all property belonging to the responsible person, whether
   real or personal, may be issued; and
   
   
   
   (3)	The responsible person shall be liable for the attorney&#8217;s fees and
   costs of the legal action, and interest on the amount due.

   (b)	Take any other appropriate collection measures.

   4314.5. The Director may settle claims for cost recovery and, in doing so, may
   settle a claim, if appropriate, based upon consideration of such factors as
   the cost of the response or corrective action, the likelihood of recovery, the
   solvency of the responsible person, the costs of judicial action, and
   pollution prevention measures undertaken by the responsible person.

   4314.6. When the Director pursues cost recovery pursuant to § 3 of the

   the cost and expense incurred by the District of Columbia for abating the
   nuisance, preventing recurrence of the violation, cleaning and clearing the
   site where the unlawful disposal occurred, and for properly disposing of the
   waste;
   
   
   
   (b)	The Director shall also require the payment of interest on any outstanding
   sums due under paragraph (a) of this subsection, as well as reimbursement for
   private collection services, when used; and
   
   
   
   (c)	When the Director is seeking criminal or civil penalties in court pursuant
   to § 3 of the Illegal Dumping Enforcement Act, D.C. Official Code §
   8-902(b)(3), (b)(4), and (c), the Director may also request the court to order
