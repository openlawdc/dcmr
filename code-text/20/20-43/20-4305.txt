NOTICE OF VIOLATION, THREAT, OR RELEASE (§ 20-4305)

4305.1. Except as provided in §§ 4308, 4311, 4313, and 4314, the Director
   shall commence an enforcement action pursuant to this chapter with a written
   notice of violation, threat, or release issued to the generator, transporter,
   owner or operator of a regulated facility, or any other responsible person
   (the &#8220;respondent&#8221;) deemed appropriate by the Director.

   4305.2. The notice of violation, threat, or release shall identify the alleged
   violation, threat, or release, and may require the respondent to conduct
   monitoring or testing, or to take any response or corrective measures the
   Director determines reasonable and necessary.

   4305.3. A &#8220;Notice of Violation,&#8221; &#8220;Notice of Threat,&#8221;
   or &#8220;Notice of Release&#8221; shall make clear the basis for the notice,
   and that the respondent&#8217;s failure to take the measures directed will
   constitute an additional violation of the pertinent statute or regulation.

   4305.4. A field notice or directive letter issued pursuant to § 4302.6 may
   serve as a notice of violation, threat, or release, provided it meets the
   requirements of this section.

   4305.5. The Director shall serve a notice of violation, threat, or release on
   the respondent or the respondent&#8217;s authorized representative in person
   or by certified mail, return receipt requested. If the responsible person
   fails or refuses to accept certified mail, the Director may serve the notice
   of violation, threat, or release by regular first class mail; provided the
   following requirements are met:
   
   
   
   (a)	The Director shall send the notice to the last known address listed on the
   person&#8217;s application for an EPA identification number, biennial report,
   or other official correspondence submitted to the Department; or
   
   
   
   (b)	The Director shall verify the accuracy of the address.

   4305.6. Where dangerous chemicals, hazardous waste, used oil, or regulated
   medical waste on property pose a threat to human health or the environment, or
   where there is a release of hazardous waste, used oil, or regulated medical
   waste into the environment, and the responsible person, or the address of the
   responsible person, is unknown or cannot be located, the Director may serve
   written notice by conspicuously posting the notice on the property where the
   threat exists or the release occurred and sending a copy to the owner of the
   property at the owner&#8217;s last known address via certified mail.
