915.1. For the duration of the District of Columbia&#8217;s (District)
   participation in the National Low Emission Vehicles Program (NLEV), automobile
   manufacturers may comply with NLEV or equally stringent mandatory federal
   standards in lieu of compliance with any program, including any mandates for
   sales of zero emissions vehicles (ZEV mandate), adopted by the District
   pursuant to the authority provided in section 177 of the Clean Air Act
   (Section 177 Program) applicable to passenger cars, light-duty trucks up
   through six thousand (6,000) pounds GVWR, and/or medium-duty vehicles from six
   thousand and one (6,001) to fourteen thousand (14,000) pounds GVWR if designed
   to operate on gasoline.

   915.2. The District&#8217;s participation in NLEV extends until model year
   2006, except as provided in 40 CFR 86.1707. If, no later than December 15,
   2000, the U.S. EPA does not adopt standards at least as stringent as the NLEV
   standards provided in 40 CFR part 86 subpart R that apply to new motor
   vehicles in model year 2004, 2005, or 2006, the District&#8217;s participation
   in NLEV extends only until model year 2004, except as provided in 40 CFR
   86.1707.

   915.3. If a covered manufacturer, as defined at 40 CFR 86.1702, opts out of
   NLEV pursuant to the NLEV regulations at 40 CFR 86.1707, the transition from
   NLEV requirements to any District section 177 program applicable to passenger
   cars, light-duty trucks up through six thousand (6,000) pounds GVWR, and/or
   medium-duty vehicles from six thousand and one (6,001) to fourteen thousand
   (14,000) pounds GVWR if designed to operate on gasoline will proceed in
   accordance with the EPA NLEV regulations at 40 CFR 86.1707.
