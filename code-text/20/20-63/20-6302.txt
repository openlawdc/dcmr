ENTRY FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION (§ 20-6302)

6302.1. The Director may enter upon property to perform, or cause to be
   performed, release response and corrective actions which are necessary to
   protect human health or the environment in any of the following circumstances,
   upon compliance with the notice requirements of this section:
   
   
   
   (a)	Where no person can be found within ninety (90) days who is an owner or
   operator subject to the requirements of Chapter 62, and capable of proper
   implementation of the required corrective action;
   
   
   
   (b)	Where a situation exists which requires immediate action by the Director
   to protect human health and the environment;
   
   
   
   (c)	Where corrective action costs at a facility exceed the amount of coverage
   required by the Director pursuant to the financial responsibility requirements
   and action by the Director is necessary to ensure an effective corrective
   action; or
   
   
   
   (d)	Where the responsible party has failed or refused to comply with an order
   issued by the Director requiring compliance with the corrective action rules.

   6302.2. Except as provided in § 6302.4, the Director shall provide written
   notice of his or her intention to enter the property to take corrective
   action, at least ten (10) working days prior to commencing work, and shall
   serve the notice in the following manner:
   
   
   
   (a)	By personal delivery to the owner, operator or agent in charge employed by
   the owner or operator, or to a person of suitable age and discretion, over
   sixteen (16) years of age, residing or employed at the address of the owner or
   operator at the premises;
   
   
   
   (b)	By registered mail, return receipt requested to the last known address of
   the owner or operator; or
   
   
   
   (c)	If service cannot be effected as provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this
   subsection, then service shall be effected as follows:
   
   
   
   (1)	By publishing the notice once a week for three (3) weeks in a newspaper of
   general circulation in the District of Columbia, and
   
   
   
   (2)	By conspicuous posting of the notice on the property.

   6302.3. Where the owner or operator is a corporation, any notice to be served,
   if served on the president, treasurer, general manager, or any principal
   officer of such corporation in the manner provided in § 6302.2, shall be
   deemed to have been served on the corporation. If the owner or operator is a
   foreign corporation, service on the registered agent of the corporation shall
   also be deemed service on the corporation.

   6302.4. Where a release of a regulated substance from an underground storage
   tank creates an imminent threat to human health or the environment
   necessitating summary corrective action, and the emergency nature of the
   situation makes it impractical to give prior notice as provided in § 6302.2,
   the Director may provide notice by conspicuous posting on the property at the
   earliest time feasible, prior to commencing work. Even if personal service or
   service by registered mail is effected, notice shall also be provided by
   posting.
   
   
   
   6302.5 	Except as provided in §6302.4, the written notice of intention to
   begin corrective action shall contain the following information:

   (b) 	The name and address of the owner or operator or other responsible party
   to whom the notice is directed;
   
   
   
   (c) 	A statement of the authority pursuant to which the director is taking the
   corrective action;
   
   
   
   (d) 	A brief summary of the corrective actions to be taken and the conditions
   in need of correction;
   
   
   
   (e) 	A description of the location where work will take place, including both
   street address, and lot and square numbers or, where there are no lot and
   square numbers, the parcel number;
   
   
   
   (f) 	Notice of any applicable hearing rights to which the owner or operator is
   entitled under the Act or under Chapter 66, if such a notice has not already
   been served;
   
   
   
   (g) 	A statement that the Director will pursue cost recovery against the
   responsible party for all corrective action costs and related expenses;
   
   
   
   (h) 	The name, position, office address, and phone number of the employee
   issuing the notice and the name and phone number of the appropriate contact
   person within the Department; and
