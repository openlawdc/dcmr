                                  DC REGULATIONS

TANK UPGRADES (§ 20-5801)

5801.1. Steel tanks shall be upgraded in accordance with the requirements of
   this chapter. Owners or operators shall follow the manufacturer&#8217;s
   specifications or established procedures and practices adopted by a nationally
   recognized association or an independent testing laboratory, specified by the
   Director pursuant to §§ 5506.1 and 5506.2.

   5801.2. An underground storage tank may be upgraded by internal lining if the
   following requirements are met:
   
   
   
   (a)	The interior of the tank is inspected and assessed to ensure that the tank
   is structurally sound prior to installing the internal lining in accordance
   with current practice recommended by the American Petroleum Institute
   (&#8220;API&#8221;); and
   
   
   
   (b)	The lining is installed in accordance with the requirements of § 5902 of
   this chapter.

   5801.3. Within ten (10) years after lining, and every five (5) years
   thereafter, the interior of the lined tank shall be inspected to ensure it is
   structurally sound, free of corrosion holes and that the lining is still
   performing in accordance with original design specifications.

   5801.4. Tank linings that have lost adhesion, cracked, or otherwise fail to
   meet original design specifications shall be replaced unless the damaged
   lining may be repaired and restored to a level of performance in accordance
   with original design specifications.

   5801.5. A tank may be upgraded by cathodic protection if the cathodic
   protection system meets the requirements of either § 5701.2 (a) or (b) and §
   5701.3, and the integrity of the tank is ensured using one (1) of the
   following methods:
   
   
   
   (a)	The interior of the tank is inspected and assessed to ensure that the tank
   is structurally sound and free of corrosion holes prior to installing the
   cathodic protection system; or
   
   
   
   (b)	The tank has been installed for less than ten (10) years and is monitored
   monthly for releases in accordance with §§ 6008 through 6012; or
   
   
   
   (c)	The tank has been installed for less than ten (10) years and is assessed
   for corrosion holes by conducting two (2) tank tightness tests that meet the
   requirements of § 6007. The first tank tightness test shall be conducted
   prior to installing the cathodic protection system. The second tank tightness
   test shall be conducted between three (3) and six (6) months following the
   first operation of the cathodic protection system; or
   
   
   
   (d)	The tank is assessed for corrosion holes by a method that is determined by
   the Director to prevent releases in a manner that is no less protective of
   human health and the environment than a system which complies with §§
   5801.5(a) through (c) of this section.

   5801.6. An underground storage tank may be upgraded by both internal lining
   and cathodic protection if the following requirements are met:
   
   
   
   (a)	The lining is installed in accordance with the requirements of § 5902;
   and
   
   
   
   (b)	The cathodic protection system meets the requirements of either § 5701.2
   (a) or (b) and § 5701.4.
