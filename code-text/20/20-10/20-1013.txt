                                  DC REGULATIONS

PROGRAM AUDIT (ยง 20-1013)

1013.1. The Director shall conduct an audit of the NOx Budget Program
   beginning in 2002 and every three (3) years thereafter to ensure that the
   program is providing expected performance regarding emissions monitoring and
   allowance use. The audits shall include, as appropriate, confirmation of
   emissions reporting accuracy through validation of CEMS and data acquisition
   systems at the budget source, and review of allowance transfer and use by
   budget sources measured by geographic distribution and daily emission totals.
   Each periodic audit will examine the extent to which banked allowances have,
   or have not, contributed to emissions in excess of the budget for each year
   preceding the audit. The periodic audit shall further provide an assessment
   that the program is consistent with the requirements for reasonable further
   progress and the attainment demonstration.

   1013.2. The Director may request a third party audit of the program.

   1013.3. If an audit conducted pursuant to this section results in
   recommendations for program revisions, the Director shall consider the audit
   recommendations and, if necessary, propose appropriate program revisions.
