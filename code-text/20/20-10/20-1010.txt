                                  DC REGULATIONS

END-OF-SEASON RECONCILIATION (ยง 20-1010)

1010.1. Compliance with this Chapter shall be determined by combining
   monitored emissions data, as reported by the budget source to the Director and
   as adjusted by the Director to be in accordance with ยง 1007, with allowance
   allocations and transfers recorded in the NATS.

   1010.2. Each year during the period November 1st through December 31st,
   inclusive, the AAR shall request from the Administrator a deduction of the
   current year allowances from the compliance account equivalent to the NOx
   emissions from the budget source in the current control period. The AAR shall
   submit this request to the Administrator by the allowance transfer deadline
   and shall identify the compliance account from which the deductions should be
   made and the serial numbers of the allowances to be deducted.

   1010.3. Regardless of the request for deductions submitted pursuant to ยง
   1010.2, the Administrator shall deduct a number of allowances equal to the
   current control period NOx emissions from the budget source&#8217;s compliance
   account and determine whether sufficient allowances are in the compliance
   account equivalent to emissions.

   1010.4. If the budget source&#8217;s emissions in the current control period
   exceed the allowances in the budget source&#8217;s compliance account for the
   control period, the budget source is responsible for obtaining additional
   allowances so that the total number of allowances in the compliance account,
   including allowance transfers properly submitted to the Administrator by the
   allowance transfer deadline, equals the control period emissions of NOx
   rounded to the nearest whole ton.

   1010.5. A budget source&#8217;s failure to obtain and hold in its compliance
   account, for any control period, as of the allowance transfer deadline,
   sufficient allowances equal to or exceeding emissions for the control period,
   shall result in enforcement action and penalties pursuant to ยง 1012.
