                                  DC REGULATIONS

SAMPLING, TESTS, AND MEASUREMENTS (§ 20-502)

502.1. The Mayor may conduct, or cause to be conducted, or require an owner or
   operator to conduct, tests of emission of air pollutants from any source. The
   Mayor shall not require an owner or operator to conduct tests with
   unreasonable frequency.

   502.2. Upon request by the Mayor, the person responsible for the source to be
   tested shall provide necessary holes in stacks or ducts and any other safe and
   proper sampling and testing facilities that may be necessary for proper
   determination of the emission of air pollutants. The Mayor may take or cause
   to be taken samples of fuel by any appropriate means in the quantities he or
   she feels are necessary.

   502.3. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this subtitle,
   the Mayor may require or approve modifications to testing and measurement
   procedures and methods, calculation methods and performance specifications
   provided in this subtitle, to take into account the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Specific conditions at the site or location;
   
   
   
   (b)	Latest available techniques;
   
   
   
   (c)	Good practices;
   
   
   
   (d)	Equivalency of the modified technique with the specified technique, in
   terms of results;
   
   
   
   (e)	Simplicity of the modified technique in terms of adequacy of the results
   in determining compliance or violation; and
   
   
   
   (f)	Other relevant factors.

   502.4. The Mayor shall require the submission of reports on any tests he or
   she may require. The reports shall do the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Be reasonably comprehensive;
   
   
   
   (b)	Contain all raw data obtained during the tests, including data on
   calibration of equipment;
   
   
   
   (c)	Contain reasonable data on various design and operating parameters of the
   source and associated equipment;
   
   
   
   (d)	Contain reasonable data on the quantities and properties of fuel raw
   materials consumed; and
   
   
   
   (e)	Contain results of the tests in terms that can be compared directly to
   emission and other appropriate limitations in this subtitle.

   502.5. Tests for particulate matter emissions, nitrogen oxide emissions, and
   sulfur oxide emissions shall be undertaken in accordance with the appropriate
   methods in Appendix A to Part 60 of Title 40 CFR, revised as of July 1, 1982.

   502.6. Tests for the sulfur content of fuels shall be undertaken in accordance
   with the methods specified in § 60.45(f)(5) of Title 40 CFR, revised as of
   July 1, 1982.

   502.7. Visible emissions may be read by a qualified observer without the aid
   of any devices, by an observer with the aid of hand-held charts prepared on
   the principle of the Ringelmann Smoke Chart, or by other reasonable devices
   approved by the Mayor.

   502.8. An observer may become qualified to take visible emission readings
   without the aid of any devices by being certified in accordance with the
   appropriate provisions of item 3, Qualifications and Testing of Method 9,
   Appendix A to Part 60 of Title 40 CFR, revised as of July 1, 1982. That
   certification shall be valid for a period of one (1) year.

   502.9. Qualified observers shall take readings in accordance with the
   appropriate provisions of items 2.1 Position, and 2.3 Observations, of Method
   9 referred to in § 502.8. Readings by the qualified observer shall be taken
   momentarily at approximate intervals of fifteen (15) seconds and shall be
   recorded to the nearest five percent (5%) opacity; each momentary observation
   recorded shall represent the opacity of the emissions during the fifteen (15)
   second interval.

   502.10. Continuous monitoring and recording equipment for visible emissions
   shall meet the performance specifications in the appropriate provisions of
   Performance Specification 1 in Appendix B to Part 60 of Title 40 CFR, revised
   as of July 1, 1982, and shall be installed, calibrated, operated, and
   maintained in accordance with the appropriate provisions of items 3.4 Cycling
   Times, 3.5 Monitor Location, 3.7 Zero and Drift, and 3.8 Span, in Appendix P
   to Part 51 of Title 40 CFR revised as of July 1, 1982.

   502.11. [Repealed]

   502.12. [Repealed]

   502.13. Stationary sources other than those specified in §§ 502.14 and
   502.17 shall be tested in accordance with the provisions of this section.

   502.14. Stationary sources of hazardous air pollutants shall be tested in
   accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR, Part 61.

   502.15. Except for sources subject to the standards of performance as set
   forth in 40 CFR Part 60, the Mayor may grant waivers on a case-by-case basis
   from the requirements of § 502.13 if, based upon a technical evaluation of
   the past performance of similar source types, using similar control methods,
   the Mayor reasonably expects the new or modified source to perform in
   compliance with applicable standards of performance.

   502.16. Tests for determining the Reid Vapor Pressure of gasoline and
   gasoline-oxygenate blends shall be undertaken in accordance with appropriate
   methods as set forth in 40 CFR Part 80, Appendix E.

   502.17. Tests for emissions of volatile organic compounds shall be undertaken
   in accordance with the appropriate methods in Appendix 5-1 to this chapter.

   502.18. For the purpose of determining compliance with Subsection 904.1, the
   oxygen content of gasoline shall be determined by:
   
   
   
   (a)	Using the sampling methodologies set forth at 40 CFR Part 80, Appendix D
   (July 1, 1999), relating to sampling procedures for fuel volatility, or other
   methods approved by EPA and the Mayor;
   
   
   
   (b)	Using American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) test method
   D-4815-89, or any method approved by EPA and the Mayor;
   
   
   
   (c)	Using the procedures for calculating the oxygen content of gasoline
   described in the EPA guidance document entitled &#8220;Guidelines for
   Oxygenated Gasoline Credit Programs and Guidelines on Establishment of Control
