                                  DC REGULATIONS

PETROLEUM DRY CLEANERS (§ 20-706)

706.1. Section 706 shall apply to petroleum solvent washers, dryers, solvent
   filters, settling tanks, vacuum stills, and other containers and conveyors of
   petroleum solvent that are used in petroleum solvent dry cleaning facilities.

   706.2. Each owner or operator of a petroleum solvent dry cleaning dryer shall
   do one (1) of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Limit emissions to the atmosphere to an average of three and one-half
   pounds (3.5 lbs.) of volatile organic compounds per one-hundred pounds (100
   lbs.) dry weight of articles dry cleaned; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Install and operate a solvent recovery dryer in a manner such that the
   dryer remains closed and the recovery phase continues until the final
   recovered solvent flow rate of fifty (50) milliliters per minute is attained.

   706.3. Each owner or operator of a petroleum solvent filtration system shall
   do one (1) of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Reduce the volatile organic compound content in all filtration wastes to
   one pound (1.0 lb.) or less per one hundred pounds (100 lbs.) dry weight of
   articles dry cleaned, before disposal and exposure to the atmosphere, or
   
   
   
   (b)	Install and operate a cartridge filtration system, and drain the filter
   cartridges in their sealed housings for eight hours (8 hrs.) or more before
   their removal.

   706.4. Each owner or operator of a petroleum solvent vacuum still shall store
   all vacuum still wastes in a manner that minimizes emission of volatile
   organic compounds to the atmosphere.

   706.5. Each owner or operator of a petroleum solvent dry cleaning facility
   shall repair all petroleum solvent vapor and liquid leaks within three (3)
   working days after identifying the leaks. If necessary repair parts are not on
   hand, the owner or operator shall order these parts within three (3) working
   days, and repair the leaks no later than three (3) working days following the
   arrival of the necessary parts.

   706.6. The Mayor may exempt any facility from any provision of §§ 706.2
   through 706.5 if it is demonstrated that hardships justify such an exemption.

   706.7. Compliance with § 706.2(a) shall be determined by the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Calculating and recording the weight of the volatile organic compounds
   vented from the dryer emission control device calculated by using EPA
   Reference Test (40 CFR, Part 60) Methods 1 and 2, and Method 25A published at
   45 CFR 83126, December 17, 1980, with the following specifications:
   
   
   
   (1)	Field calibration of the flame ionization analyzer with propane standards;
   
   
   
   (2)	Laboratory determination of the flame ionization analyzer response to a
   given part per million by volume concentration of propane to the response to
   the same parts per million concentration of the volatile organic compounds to
   be measured; and
   
   
   
   (3)	Determination of the weight of volatile organic compounds vented to the
   atmosphere by the following:
   
   
   
   (A)	The multiplication of the ratio determined in § 706.7(a)(2) by the
   measured concentration of volatile organic compound gas (as propane) as
   indicated by the flame ionization analyzer response output record;
   
   
   
   (B)	The conversion of the parts per million by volume value calculated in §
   706.7(a)(3)(A) into a mass concentration value for the volatile organic
   compounds present; and
   
   
   
   (C)	Multiplying the mass concentration value calculated in § 706.7(a)(3)(B)
   by the exhaust flow rate determined by using EPA Reference Test Methods 1 and
   2;
   
   
   
   (b)	Calculating and recording the dry weight of articles dry cleaned; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Repeating paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection for normal operating
   conditions that encompass at least thirty (30) dryer loads, which total not
   less than four thousand (4,000) pounds dry weight, and represent a normal
   range of variations in fabrics, solvents, load weights, temperatures, flow
   rates, and process deviations.

   706.8. Compliance with § 706.2(b) shall be determined by the owner or
   operator verifying that the flow rate of recovered solvent from the solvent
   recovery dryer at the termination of the recovery phase is no greater than
   fifty (50) millimeters per minute.

   706.9. The procedure referred to in § 706.8 shall be conducted one (1) time
   for a duration of no less than two (2) weeks during which time no less than
   fifty percent (50%) of the dryer loads shall be monitored for their final
   recovered solvent flow rate. The suggested point for measuring the flow rate
   of recovered solvent is from the solvent-water separator. Near the end of the
   recovery cycle, the flow of recovered solvent should be diverted to a
   graduated cylinder. The cycle should continue until the minimum flow of
   solvent is fifty (50) milliliters per minute. The type of articles cleaned and
   the total length of the cycle should then be recorded.

   706.10. Compliance with § 706.3(a) shall be determined as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	Calculate and record the weight of volatile organic compounds contained in
   at least five (5) two (2) pound samples of filtration waste taken at intervals
   of at least one (1) week, by employing ASTM Method D322-80 (Gasoline Diluent
   in Used Gasoline Engine Oils by Distillation);
   
   
   
   (b)	Calculate and record the total dry weight of articles dry cleaned during
   the intervals between removal of filtration waste samples, as well as the
   total mass of filtration waste produced in the same period; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Calculate and record the weight of volatile organic compounds contained in
   filtration waste material per one-hundred pounds (100 lbs.) dry weight of
   articles dry cleaned.

   706.11. Compliance with §§ 706.4 through 706.5 requires that each owner or
   operator make weekly inspections of washers, dryers, solvent filters, settling
   tanks, vacuum stills, and all containers and conveyors of petroleum solvent to
   identify perceptible volatile organic compounds vapor or liquid leaks.

   706.12. To be in compliance with §§ 706.2 through 706.5 the owner or
   operator may use an equivalent test procedure or method; Provided, that this
   method or procedure has been previously approved by the Mayor.

   706.13. The owner or operator of a petroleum solvent dry cleaning facility
   subject to this subtitle which is in existence on the effective date of the
   District of Columbia Air Pollution Control Act of 1984 shall meet the
   applicable increments of progress contained in the following schedule:
   
   
   
   (a)	Submit to the Mayor final plans for the emission control equipment no
   later than June 1, 1985;
   
   
   
   (b)	Award contracts for the emission control equipment no later than September
   1, 1985;
   
   
   
   (c)	Complete on-site construction or installation of the emission control
   equipment no later than August 1, 1986; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Achieve final compliance with the Regulation no later than September 1,
   1986.
