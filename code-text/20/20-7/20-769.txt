SOLVENT CLEANING â€“ RECORDKEEPING ANDMONITORING (§ 20-769)

769.1. The operator of a solvent cleaning machinesubject to Â§Â§ 764
   through 767 shall conductmonitoring and record keeping as follows: Â (a) If a
   freeboardrefrigeration device is used to comply with these standards, theowner
   or operator shall use a thermometer or thermocouple tomeasure the temperature
   at the center of the air blanket during theidling mode. Measurements and
   recordings shall be made weekly; (b)If a superheated vapor system is used to
   comply with thesestandards, the owner or operator shall use a thermometer
   orthermocouple to measure the temperature at the center of thesuperheated
   solvent vapor zone while the solvent cleaning machineis in the idling mode.
   Measurements and recordings shall be madeweekly; (c) If a cover (working-mode,
   downtime-mode, or idling-modecover) is used to comply with these standards,
   the owner oroperator shall conduct a visual inspection to determine if
   thecover opens and closes properly, completely covers the cleaningmachine
   openings when closed, and is free of cracks, holes, andother defects.
   Observations and recordings shall be made weekly;(d) If dwell is used, the
   owner or operator shall determine theactual dwell time by measuring the period
   of time that parts areheld within the freeboard area of the solvent cleaning
   machineafter cleaning. Observations and recordings shall be made monthly;(e)
   The owner or operator shall determine the hoist speed bymeasuring the time it
   takes for the hoist to travel a measureddistance. The speed is equal to the
   distance in meters divided bythe time in minutes (meters per minute).
   Measurements andrecordings shall be made monthly; (f) The owner or operator of
   abatch vapor or in-line solvent cleaning machine complying usingreduced room
   draft, maintained by controlling room parametersincluding but not limited to
   redirecting fans, and closing doorsand windows, shall conduct monitoring and
   record the results asfollows: (1) Initially measure the wind speed within six
   inches (6in.) above the top of the freeboard area of the solvent
   cleaningmachine in accordance with the following: (A) Determine thedirection
   of the wind current by slowly rotating a velometer orsimilar device until the
   maximum speed is located; (B) Orient avelometer in the direction of the wind
   current at each of the fourcorners of the machine; (C) Record the reading for
   each corner; and(D) Average the values obtained at each corner and record
   theaverage wind speed; (2) Record the room parameters establishedduring the
   initial compliance test to achieve the reduced roomdraft; (3) Quarterly
   monitor the wind speed in accordance withsubparagraph (f)(1) of this section;
   and (4) Weekly monitor theroom parameters as specified in this section; (g) If
   an enclosure,full or partial, is used to achieve reduced room draft, the
   owneror operator shall conduct an initial monitoring test and,thereafter,
   monthly monitoring tests of the wind speed within theenclosure by slowly
   rotating a velometer inside the entrance to theenclosure until the maximum
   speed is located and record the maximumwind speed. The owner or operator shall
   also conduct a monthlyvisual inspection of the enclosure to determine if it is
   free ofcracks, holes, and other defects; and (h) If a carbon adsorber isused
   to comply with these standards, the owner or operator shallmeasure and record
   the concentration of halogenated HAP solvent inthe exhaust of the carbon
   adsorber weekly with a colorimetricdetector tube; (1) This test shall be
   conducted while the solventcleaning machine is in the working mode and is
   venting to thecarbon adsorber; (2) The exhaust concentration shall be
   determinedusing a colorimetric detector tube designed to measure
   aconcentration of one hundred parts per million (100 ppm) by volumeof solvent
   in air to an accuracy of plus or minus twenty-five partsper million (25 ppm)
   by volume; and (3) The concentration shall bedetermined through a sampling
   port for monitoring within theexhaust outlet that is easily accessible and
   located at least eight(8) stack or duct diameters downstream and two (2) stack
   or ductdiameters upstream from any flow disturbance such as a bend,expansion,
   contraction, or outlet; downstream from no other inlet.SOURCE: Notice of Final
