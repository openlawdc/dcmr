   districts.

   747.7. If air pollution control equipment is used to meet the requirements of
   §§ 743 to 749, the owner or operator shall make the following
   determinations:
   
   
   
   (a)	The measurement of capture efficiency shall be conducted and reported in
   accordance with the U.S. EPA Technical Document, “Guidelines for Determining
   Capture Efficiency,” issued January 9, 1995, or a District capture
   efficiency determination method approved by the U.S. EPA; and
