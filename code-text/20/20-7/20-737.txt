CONSUMER PRODUCTS – VARIANCE REQUESTS (§ 20-737)

737.1. Any person who cannot comply with the requirements set forth in §§
   720 and 722 through 731 because of extraordinary reasons beyond the
   person&#8217;s reasonable control may apply in writing to the Department for a
   variance according to the following requirements:
   
   
   
   	   	 (a)		The variance application shall include:
   
   
   
   (1)	The specific grounds upon which the variance is sought;
   
   
   
   (2)	The proposed date(s) by which compliance with the provisions of §§ 720
   and 722 through 731 will be achieved; and
   
   
   
   (3)	A compliance report reasonably detailing the methods by which compliance
   will be achieved;
   
   
   
   		(b)	Upon receipt of a variance application containing the information
   required in paragraph (a), the Department shall hold a public hearing to
   determine whether, under what conditions, and to what extent, a variance from
   the requirements in §§ 720 and 722 through 731 is necessary and will be
   permitted according to the following requirements:
   
   
   
   	(1)	A hearing shall be initiated no later than seventy-five (75) days after
   receipt of a variance application;
   
   
   
   	(2)	Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall:
   
   
   
   		(A)		Be sent to the applicant by certified mail not less than thirty (30)
   days before the hearing;
   
   
   
   (B)	Be submitted for publication in the District of Columbia Register and sent
   to every person who requests such notice, not less than thirty (30) days
   before the hearing; and
   
   
   
   (C)	State that the parties may, but need not be, represented by counsel at the
   hearing;
   
   
   
   				(3)	At least thirty (30) days before the hearing, the variance application
   shall be made available to the public for inspection; and
   
   
   
   			(4)	Interested members of the public shall be allowed a reasonable
   opportunity to testify at the hearing and their testimony shall be considered;
   
   
   
   (c) 	Information submitted to the Department by a variance applicant may be
   claimed as confidential, and such information shall be handled in accordance
   with the District of Columbia confidentiality requirements in 20 DCMR § 106.
   The Department may consider such confidential information in reaching a
   decision on a variance application;
   
   
   
   		(d)	No variance shall be granted unless all of the following findings are
   made:
   
   
   
   		(1)	Because of reasons beyond the reasonable control of the applicant,
   requiring compliance with §§ 720 and 722 through 731 would result in
   extraordinary economic hardship;
   
   
   
   		(2)	The public interest in mitigating the extraordinary hardship to the
   applicant by issuing the variance outweighs the public interest in avoiding
   any increased emissions of air contaminants which would result from issuing
   the variance; and
   
   
   
   		(3)	The compliance report proposed by the applicant can reasonably be
   implemented, and will achieve compliance as expeditiously as possible;
   
   
   
   (e)	Any variance order issued by the Department shall specify a final
   compliance date by which the requirements of §§ 720 and 722 through 731 will
   be achieved. Any variance order shall contain a condition that specifies
   increments of progress necessary to ensure timely compliance, and such other
   conditions that the Department, in consideration of the testimony received at
   the hearing, finds necessary to carry out the purposes of applicable District
   of Columbia health and safety laws and regulations;
   
   
   
   		(f)	A variance shall cease to be effective upon failure of the party to whom
   the variance was granted to comply with any term or condition of the variance;
   and
   
   
   
   (g)	Upon the application of any person, the Department may review, and for
   good cause, modify or revoke a variance from requirements of §§ 720 and 722
   through 731 after holding a public hearing in accordance with the District of
   Columbia Administrative Procedures Act, D.C. Official Code §§ 2-501, et seq.
