709.1. Except for purposes of roofing, the manufacture, mixing, storage, use,
   or application of cutback asphalt during the months of April, May, June, July,
   August, and September shall be prohibited; except, that in specific
   circumstances, when it is shown to the satisfaction of the Mayor that the
   prohibition cited in this subsection is unreasonable, liquefied asphalts
   containing volatile organic compounds may be manufactured, mixed, stored,
   used, or applied during these months, subject to any conditions which the
   Mayor may impose to minimize the emissions of volatile organic compounds into
   the atmosphere.

   709.2. In the determination of the unreasonableness of the prohibitions of
   cutback asphalt, and in the determination of the conditions that the Mayor may
   impose to minimize the emissions of volatile organic compounds, the Mayor
   shall take into consideration, among other factors, the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The need for long-life storage of the asphalt;
   
   
   
   (b)	The lack of significant evaporation of volatile organic compounds from the
   asphalt;
   
   
   
   (c)	The need to use any particular type of aggregate; and
   
   
   
   (d)	The weather conditions during the application of the asphalt.
