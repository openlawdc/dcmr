INTAGLIO, FLEXOGRAPHIC, AND ROTOGRAVURE PRINTING (§ 20-710)

710.1 	Except as provided in § 710.2, it shall be prohibited to operate:
   
   
   
   	(a)	Any intaglio printing unit or perform any intaglio printing operation,
   except in compliance with the requirements of this section; or
   
   
   
   	(b)	After January 1, 2012, any individual flexographic or rotogravure package
   printing press with the theoretical potential to emit from the dryer before
   controls of at least twenty-five tons per year (25 tpy) of VOC from inks,
   coatings and adhesives combined, except in compliance with the applicable
   requirements of this section, where any flexographic or rotogravure package
   printing press that becomes or is currently subject to § 710.1(b) will remain
   subject to the applicable requirements of this section even if its theoretical
   potential to emit has fallen or later falls below the applicability threshold.
   
   
   
   710.2 	If part or all of any printing operation involving VOC emissions is not
   specifically controlled by the requirements of this section, then the
   VOC-related emission operation or part of the operation shall be governed by
   the other requirements of this subtitle.
   
   
   
   710.3 	This section shall apply only to the emissions of VOCs; all provisions
   of this subtitle other than those restricting the emissions of VOCs apply to
   the operations regulated by this section.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
    	The use of inks, wiping solutions, and fountain solutions in
   
   connection with printing units shall comply with the limits on the percentage
   content of VOCs of the inks, wiping solutions and fountain solutions for the
   respective types of printing units and be subject to § 710.5 through 710.8.

   710.5. The VOC content of ink shall not exceed the following percentages after

   Flexography, sixty-five percent (65%), except for any individual flexographic
   package printing press with the theoretical potential to emit from the dryer
   prior to controls of at least twenty-five tons per year (25 tpy) of VOC
   (petroleum ink oil) from inks, coatings, and adhesives combined, which are
   subject to the following:
   
   
   
   (1) 	Sixty-five percent (65%) overall control for a press that was first
   installed before March 14, 1995, and that is controlled by an add-on air

   Gravure, twelve percent (12%), except for any individual rotogravure package
   printing press with the theoretical potential to emit from the dryer before
   controls of at least twenty-five tons per year (25 tpy) of VOC (petroleum ink
   oil) from inks, coatings, and adhesives combined, which are subject to the
   following:
   
   
   
   (1) 	Sixty-five percent (65%) overall control for a press that was first
   installed before March 14, 1995, and that is controlled by an add-on APCD
   whose first installation was before January 1, 2012;
   
   
   
   (2)	Seventy percent (70%) overall control for a press that was first installed

   The percentage VOC content shall be determined in accordance with Procedure B
   of test method ASTM D-2369-81; where, in lieu of testing the formulated inks
   and solutions, the individual components of the formulations may be tested and
   the VOC content of the formulations may be calculated there from; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The percentage water content shall be determined in accordance with test
   method ASTM D-3792-79.

   710.10. Ink usage in connection with all forms of intaglio printing shall be
   minimized to the extent feasible by routing the inking cylinders or other
   techniques.
   
   
   
   710.11 	Alternate VOC emission reduction systems may be used to attain
   compliance with § 710.5 through 710.8 in place of the specific requirements
   stated in those sections provided that:
   
   
   
   (a) 	The alternate VOC reduction system(s) is demonstrated to have at least
   equivalent results in limiting emissions of VOCs as would the application of
   the requirements of those sections; and
   
   
   
   (b) 	The alternate system(s) shall be approved by the Department.

   710.12. All containers holding or conveying VOC-containing materials shall be
   open only when necessary and openings shall be restricted to the extent
   feasible.

   710.13. The leaking of any solvent or solvent-containing materials from any
   printing unit or associated equipment shall be prohibited.

   710.14. The storage or disposal of any solvent or solvent-containing material,
   including waste material, in a manner that will cause or allow its evaporation
   into the atmosphere shall be prohibited.

   710.15. To the greatest extent feasible, persons operating printing units and
   associated equipment shall minimize their use of VOC-containing materials by
   restricting wasteful usage and by replacing the material with emulsions or
   other materials.

   710.16. For establishments to which § 710.5 through 710.8 apply, but within
   which one (1) or more printing units is demonstrated to be unable to comply or
   cannot feasibly comply, any person owning or operating the establishment may
   bring it into compliance by reducing VOC emissions from other printing units
   within the establishment as follows:
   
   
   
   (a) 	In a ratio of five (5) units of reduced emissions for each one (1) unit
   of excess emissions for operations during the months of April, May, June,
   July, August, and September;
   
   
   
   (b) 	In a ratio of one (1) unit of reduced emissions for each one (1) unit of
   excess emissions for operations during the months of October, November,
   December, January, February and March; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Provided, that:
   
   
   
   (1) 	The owner or operator demonstrates to the Department that the reduction
   ratio is met by the proposed trade;
   
   
   
   (2) 	The Department approves the proposed trade; and
   
   
   
   (3) 	The proposed trade is legally enforceable against the owner and operator
   of the establishment.
