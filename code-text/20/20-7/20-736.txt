                                  DC REGULATIONS

CONSUMER PRODUCTS – INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS EXEMPTION (§ 20-736)

736.1. Any manufacturer claiming an exemption from the Table of Standards in
   § 720.1 based on a CARB Innovative Products exemption under the Innovative
   Products provisions in Subchapter 8.5, Article 2, § 94511, or Subchapter 8.5,
   Article 1, § 94503.5 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations, must
   submit to the Department a copy of the CARB Innovative Product exemption
   decision including the executive order and all conditions established by CARB
   applicable to the exemption.

   736.2. Manufacturers of consumer products that have been granted an Innovative
   Products exemption under the Innovative Products provisions in Subchapter 8.5,
   Article 2, § 94511, or Subchapter 8.5, Article 1, § 94503.5 of Title 17 of
   the California Code of Regulations based on California specific data, or that
   have not been granted an exemption by CARB, may apply for an Innovative
   Products exemption from the District of Columbia if the product meets the
   following criteria:
   
   
   
   	(a)	The manufacturer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that due
   to some characteristic of the product formulation, design, delivery systems or
   other factors, the use of the product will result in less VOC emissions as
   compared to:
   
   
   
   		(1)	The VOC emissions from a representative consumer product which complies
   with the VOC limits specified in the Table of Standards in § 720.1; or
   
   
   
   		(2)	The calculated VOC emissions from a non-complying representative
   product, if the product had been reformulated to comply with the VOC limits
   specified in the Table of Standards in § 720.1; and
   
   
   
   (3)	VOC emissions shall be calculated using the following equation:
   
   
   
   		ER  =  ENC  x  VOCSTD ¸ VOCNC
   
   
   
   				where:
   
   
   
   			ER  	= 	The VOC emissions from the non-complying representative product,
   had it been reformulated;
   
   
   
   			ENC  	=	The VOC emissions from the non-complying representative product in
   its current formulation;
   
   
   
   			VOCSTD  =	The VOC limit specified in the Table of Standards in § 720.1;
   and
   
   
   
   		VOCNC   =	The VOC content of the non-complying product in its current
   formulation;
   
   
   
   				(b)	If a manufacturer demonstrates that the equation in paragraph (a) of
   this section yields inaccurate results due to some characteristic of the
   product formulation or other factors, an alternative method that accurately
   calculates emissions may be used upon approval of the Department;
   
   
   
   		(c)	For the purposes of this section, representative consumer product means
   a consumer product that meets all of the following criteria:
   
   
   
   		(1)	The representative product shall be subject to the same VOC limit in the
   Table of Standards in § 720.1 as the innovative product;
   
   
   
   		(2)	The representative product shall be of the same product form as the
   innovative product, unless the innovative product uses a new form that does
   not exist in the product category at the time the application is made; and
   
   
   
   		(3) 	The representative product shall have at least similar efficacy as
   other consumer products in the same product category based on tests generally
   accepted for that product category by the consumer products industry;
   
   
   
   (d)	To apply for an innovative products exemption under this section, a
   manufacturer shall submit a written application to the Department, which
   includes:
   
   
   
   (1)	The supporting documentation that demonstrates the emissions from the
   innovative product, including the actual physical test methods used to
   generate the data and, if necessary, the consumer testing undertaken to
   document product usage; and
   
   
   
   				(2)	Any information necessary to enable the Department to establish
   enforceable conditions for granting the exemption including the VOC content
   for the innovative product and test methods for determining the VOC content;
   
   
   
   (e)	The Department shall comply with the following process in responding to
   applications for exemptions:
   
   
   
   	(1)	All information submitted by a manufacturer pursuant to paragraph (d)
   shall be handled in accordance with the District of Columbia confidentiality
   requirements in 20 DCMR § 106;
   
   
   
   			(2)	Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the exemption application the
   Department shall determine whether an application is complete;
   
   
   
   				(3)	Within ninety (90) days after an application has been deemed complete,
   the Department shall determine whether, under what conditions, and to what
   extent, an exemption from the requirements of §720 will be permitted;
   
   
   
   (A)	The applicant and the Department may mutually agree to a longer time
   period for reaching a decision; and
   
   
   
   (B)	Additional supporting documentation may be submitted by the applicant
   before a decision is reached;
   
   
   
   				(4)	The Department shall notify the applicant of the decision in writing
   and specify such terms and conditions that are necessary to ensure that
   emissions from the product will meet the emissions reductions specified in
   subparagraph (a)(1), and that such emissions reductions can be enforced; and
   
   
   
   			(5)	In granting an exemption for a product, the Department shall establish
   conditions that are enforceable:
   
   
   
   (A)	These conditions shall include the VOC content of the innovative product,
   dispensing rates, application rates, and any other parameters determined by
   the Department to be necessary;
   
   
   
   (B)	The Department shall also specify the test methods for determining
   conformance to the conditions established; and
   
   
   
   (C)	The test methods shall include criteria for reproducibility, accuracy,
   sampling, and laboratory procedures;
   
   
   
   (f)	For any product for which an exemption has been granted pursuant to this
   section, the manufacturer shall notify the Department in writing within thirty
   (30) days of any change in the product formulation or recommended product
   usage directions, and shall also notify the Department within thirty (30) days
   if the manufacturer learns of any information which would alter the emissions
   estimates submitted to the Department in support of the exemption application;
   
   
   
   	(g) 	If the VOC limits specified in the Table of Standards in § 720.1 are
   lowered for a product category through any subsequent rulemaking, all
   innovative product exemptions granted for products in the product category
   shall have no effect as of the effective date of the modified VOC standard,
   except for those innovative products that have VOC emissions less than the
   applicable lowered VOC limit and for which a written notification of the
   product&#8217;s emissions status versus the lowered VOC limit has been
   submitted to and approved by the Department at least sixty (60) days before
   the effective date of such limits; and
   
   
   
   	(h) 	If the Department believes that a consumer product for which an
   exemption has been granted no longer meets the criteria for an innovative
   product specified in this section, the Department may modify or revoke the
   exemption as necessary to ensure that the product will meet these criteria.
   The Department shall not modify or revoke an exemption without first affording
   the applicant an opportunity for a public hearing held in accordance with the
   District of Columbia Administrative Procedures Act, D.C. Official Code §§
   2-501, et seq.(2006 Repl.).
