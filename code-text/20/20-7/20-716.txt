OFFSET LITHOGRAPHY AND LETTERPRESS PRINTING (§ 20-716)

716.1 	Any person who owns, operates, or leases:
   
   
   
   (a)	An offset lithography printing operation that is part of any stationary
   source which emits, or has ever had the theoretical potential to emit,
   twenty-five (25) or more tons per year of VOCs shall be prohibited from
   operating the printing operation unless it is in compliance with the
   requirements of this section, where calculation of the stationary source’s
   theoretical potential to emit shall be pursuant to § 715.1;
   
   
   
   (b)	After January 1, 2012, any offset lithography or letterpress printing
   operation which emits VOCs at a rate equal to or greater than fifteen pounds
   per day (15 lb/day) actual emissions of VOC on a monthly average basis before
   consideration of controls shall comply with the requirements of this section
   through § 716.25(a); and
   
   
   
   (c)	After January 1, 2012, any offset lithography or letterpress printing

   716.2. Any printing operation or press that becomes or is currently subject to
   the provisions of this section by exceeding the applicability threshold in §
   716.1(a), 716.1(b), and 716.16 shall remain subject to these provisions even
   if its throughput or emissions or its theoretical potential to emit has fallen
   or later falls below the applicability threshold.
   
   
   
   716.3 	If part or all of any offset lithography or letterpress printing
   operation involving VOC emissions is not specifically controlled by the
   requirements of this section, then the VOC-related emission operation or part
   of the operation shall be governed by the other requirements of this subtitle
   on air quality.

   complying with § 716.16(a) or (c) shall be prohibited.

   716.18. To avoid the applicability of the limits in §716.16(b), the
   Department may grant a person a federally enforceable limitation on the
   theoretical potential to emit for any heatset web offset lithography or
   heatset web letterpress printing operation if the following conditions are
   met:
   
   
   
   (a)	The Department shall assume that twenty percent (20%) of the VOC in the
