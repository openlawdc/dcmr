SOLVENT CLEANING â€“ COLDCLEANING (§ 20-764)

764.1. This section applies to all cold cleaningmachines that process metal
   parts and contain more than one liter(1 L) of VOC. The provisions of this
   section shall not apply if theowner and operator of the cold cleaning machine
   demonstrates, andthe District approves in writing, that compliance with this
   sectionwill result in unsafe operating conditions.

   764.2. Immersion cold cleaning machines shall havea freeboard ratio of
   seventy-five one hundredths (0.75) or greater,unless the machines are equipped
   with covers that are kept closedexcept when parts are being placed into or are
   being removed fromthe machine. Â

   764.3. Immersion cold cleaning machines and remotereservoir cold cleaning
   machines shall: Â (a) Have apermanent, conspicuous label summarizing the
   operating requirementsin Â§ 764.4; and Â (b) Be equipped with a cover
   thatshall be closed at all times except during cleaning of parts or
   theaddition or removal of solvent. For remote reservoir cold cleaningmachines
   that drain directly into the solvent storage reservoir, aperforated drain with
   a diameter of not more than six inches (6in.) shall constitute an acceptable
   cover. Â 764.4 Coldcleaning machines shall be operated in accordance with
   thefollowing procedures: Â (a) Waste solvent shall be collectedand stored in
   closed containers. The closed containers may containa device that allows
   pressure relief, but does not allow liquidsolvent to drain from the container;
   Â (b) Cleaned parts shallbe drained at least fifteen (15) seconds or until
   dripping ceases,whichever is longer; (1) Parts having cavities or blind holes
   shallbe tipped or rotated while the part is draining; and (2) During
   thedraining, tipping or rotating, the parts shall be positioned sothat solvent
   drains directly back to the cold cleaning machine;Â (c) Flushing of parts
   using a flexible hose or otherflushing device shall be performed only within
   the freeboard areaof the cold cleaning machine. The solvent spray shall be a
   solidfluid stream, not an atomized or shower spray, at a pressure thatdoes not
   exceed ten pounds (10 lb.) per square inch gauge (psig);Â (d) The owner or
   operator shall ensure that when the coveris open, the cold cleaning machine is
   not exposed to drafts greaterthan forty meters (40 m.) per minute (one hundred
   thirty-two feet(132 ft.) per minute), as measured between one meter (1 m.) and
   twometers (2 m.) (three and three tenths feet (3.3 ft.) and six andsix tenths
   feet (6.6 ft.) upwind, and at the same elevation as thetank lip; Â (e)
   Sponges, fabric, wood, leather, paperproducts, and other absorbent materials
   shall not be cleaned in thecold cleaning machine; Â (f) When a pumpagitated
   solvent bathis used, the agitator shall be operated to produce a rolling
   motionof the solvent with no observable splashing of the solvent againstthe
   tank walls or the parts being cleaned. Air-agitated solventbaths may not be
   used; Â (g) Spills during solvent transferand use of the cold cleaning
   machine shall be cleaned upimmediately, and the wipe rags or other absorbent
   materials shallbe immediately stored in covered containers for disposal
   orrecycling; Â (h) Work area fans shall be located andpositioned so that they
   do not blow across the opening of thedegreaser unit; and Â (i) The owner or
   operator shall ensurethat the solvent level does not exceed the fill line.
   764.5 Anysolvent for use in a cold cleaning machine shall not have a
   vaporpressure of one millimeter of mercury (1.0 mm. Hg) or greater,measured at
   twenty degrees Celsius (20o C) or sixty-eight degreesFahrenheit (68Â° F)
   containing VOCs; 764.6 A person whosells or offers for sale any solvent
   containing VOCs for use in acold cleaning machine shall provide the following
   writteninformation to the purchaser: (a) The name and address of thesolvent
   supplier; Â (b) The type of solvent, including theproduct or vendor
   identification number; and Â (c) The vaporpressure of the solvent, measured
   in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg)at twenty degrees Celsius (20o C) or
   sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit(68Â° F); and Â 764.7 A person who operates a
   coldcleaning machine shall maintain for not less than two (2) years andshall
   provide to the Department, on request, the informationspecified in Â§ 764.6.
   An invoice, bill of sale,certificate that corresponds to a number of sales,
   Material SafetyData Sheet (MSDS), or other appropriate documentation
   acceptable tothe Department may be used to comply with this section.
