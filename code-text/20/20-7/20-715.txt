                                  DC REGULATIONS

MAJOR SOURCE AND CASE-BY-CASE REASONABLY AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY (RACT) (§
20-715)

Calculation of source emissions of VOCs to determine applicability of a
   regulation of this section shall be based on the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The theoretical potential to emit (design capacity or maximum production
   and maximum potential operating hours) before add-on controls; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The sum of all emissions from individual emission sources within the same
   control techniques guideline (CTG) category, except for petroleum/gasoline
   marketing, in which emissions from storage tanks, terminals, and loading racks
   within the same plant or site shall be summed.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Major Source and Case-by-Case Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT)
   shall be applied if the theoretical potential plant-wide emissions are, or
   have ever been, greater than or equal to twenty-five tons per year (25 tpy).
   
   
   
   715.3 	For sources for which there is no control technique guideline (CTG),
   the requirements of this section shall apply in addition to the following:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Theoretical potential emissions from all processes within a plant shall be
   summed to determine applicability of RACT;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   RACT shall be evaluated for all processes in the plant if theoretical
   potential emissions as determined by this section are greater than or equal to
   twenty-five tons per year (25 tpy); and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   RACT is not applicable if physical or operational limitations on the capacity
   of the source to emit are federally enforceable.

   715.4. Any person to which § 715.1 through 715.3 applies shall propose RACT
   based on a source-specific RACT analysis, in accordance with § 715.5 through
   715.7.

   715.5. To propose source-specific RACT, any person shall:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Notify the Department of their request for a source-specific RACT
   determination with the application for a permit;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Provide associated monitoring, testing, certification, recordkeeping, and
   reporting procedures in accordance with 20 DCMR chapter 5;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Provide a schedule for achieving compliance with the proposed RACT as
   expeditiously as practicable; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Submit the proposed RACT to the Department for approval.

   715.6. Any person who prepares and submits a source-specific RACT analysis
   shall include and provide the Department:
   
   (a)	A ranking of the available control options for the affected source in
   descending order of control effectiveness;
   
   (b) 	An evaluation of the technical feasibility of the available control
   options identified in § 715.6(a) based on physical, chemical, and engineering
   principles, where a determination of technical infeasibility shall identify
   technical difficulties which would preclude the successful use of the control
   option on the affected source;
   
   (c) 	A ranking list of the technically feasible control options in order of
   overall control effectiveness for VOC emissions that presents the array of
   control options and shall include, at a minimum, the following information:
   
   (1) 	The baseline emissions of VOCs before implementation of each control
   option;
   
   (2) 	The estimated emission reduction potential or the estimated control
   efficiency of each control option;
   
   (3) 	The estimated emissions after the application of each control option; and
   
   (4) 	The economic impacts of each control option, including both overall cost
   effectiveness and incremental cost effectiveness;
   
   (d) 	An evaluation of cost effectiveness of each control option consistent
   with the “OAQPS Control Cost Manual” (Sixth Edition), EPA/452/B-02-001,
   January 2002, and subsequent revisions, conducted in accordance with the
   following requirements:
   
   (1) 	The cost effectiveness shall be evaluated in terms of dollars per ton of
   VOC emissions reduction;
   
   (2) 	The cost effectiveness shall be calculated on average and incremental
   bases for each option, with average cost effectiveness calculated as the
   annualized cost of the control option divided by the baseline emissions rate
   minus the control option emission rate, as shown by the following formula:
   
   Average cost effectiveness ($/ton removed) =Control option total annualized
   cost ($/yr) / [Baseline emission rate – Control option rate (tons/yr)]
   
   (3) 	For purposes of this paragraph, baseline emission rate represents the
   maximum emissions before the implementation of the control option, and the
   baseline emissions rate shall be established using either test results or
   approved emission factors and historic operating data;
   
   (4) 	For purposes of this paragraph, the incremental cost effectiveness
   calculation compares the costs and emission level of a control option to those
   of the next most stringent option, as shown by the following formula:
   
   Incremental Cost (dollars) per incremental ton removed = [Control option total
   annualized cost ($/yr) – Total annualized cost of next most stringent
   control option ($/yr)] / [Next most stringent control option emission rate
   (ton/yr) – control option emission rate (ton/yr)];
   
   
   
   
   
   A recommendation of a RACT emission limitation, equipment standard, or control
   technology for each affected emission source or unit; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Additional information requested by the Department that is necessary for the
   evaluation of the RACT proposal.

   715.7. The Department will:
   
   
   
   (a)	Approve, deny, or modify each RACT proposal and will approve each
   source-specific RACT determination; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Incorporate each approved RACT determination in a permit and submit the
   RACT determination to the EPA for approval as a revision to the SIP.
