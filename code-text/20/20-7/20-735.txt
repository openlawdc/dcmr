                                  DC REGULATIONS

CONSUMER PRODUCTS – ALTERNATIVE CONTROL PLANS (§ 20-735)

735.1 	This section provides an alternate method to comply with the Table of
   Standards specified in § 720.1. This alternative is provided by allowing
   responsible parties the option of voluntarily entering into separate
   Alternative Control Plan (ACP) Agreements for consumer products, identified in
   §§ 719 through 737. Only responsible ACP parties for consumer products may
   enter into an ACP.
   
   
   
   735.2 	Any manufacturer of consumer products which has been granted an ACP
   Agreement by CARB under the provisions in Subchapter 8.5, Article 4, §§
   94540-94555, of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations, shall be
   exempt from the Table of Standards in § 720.1 for the period of time that the
   CARB ACP Agreement remains in effect, provided that all ACP Products used for
   emissions credits within the CARB ACP Agreement are contained in the Table of
   Standards in § 720.1 of this chapter. Any manufacturer claiming such an ACP
   Agreement must submit to the Department a copy of the CARB ACP decision
   including the executive order and all conditions established by CARB
   applicable to the exemption.

   735.3. Manufacturers that have been granted an ACP Agreement under the ACP
   provision in Subchapter 8.5, Article 4, §§ 94540-94555, of Title 17 of the
   California Code of Regulations based on California specific data, or that have
   not been granted an exemption by the CARB, may apply to the Department for an
   ACP Agreement in accordance with §§ 735.4 to 735.23.
   
   
   
   735.4 	An application for an ACP shall be submitted in writing to the
   Department by the responsible ACP party and shall contain all of the following
   information:
   
   
   
   (a)	An identification of the contact persons, phone numbers, names, and
   addresses of the responsible ACP party that is submitting the ACP application
   and will be implementing the ACP requirements specified in the ACP Agreement;
   
   
   
   (b)	A statement of whether the responsible ACP party is a small business or a
   one-product business, as defined in § 799;
   
   
   
   (c)	A listing of the exact product brand name, form, available variations
   including but not limited to flavors, scents, colors, and sizes, and
   applicable product categories for each distinct product that is proposed for
   inclusion in the ACP;
   
   
   
   (d)	A demonstration to the satisfaction of the Department that the enforceable
   sales records used by the responsible ACP party to track product sales for
   each proposed ACP product identified in paragraph (c) of this subsection meet
   the minimum criteria of seventy-five percent (75%) of the District of Columbia
   gross sales as specified in subparagraph (d)(5) of this subsection. To provide
   this demonstration, the responsible ACP party shall meet all of the following
   requirements:
   
   
   
   			(1)	Provide the contact persons, phone numbers, names, street and mailing
   addresses of all persons and businesses who will provide information that will
   be used to determine the enforceable sales;
   
   
   
   			(2)	Determine the enforceable sales of each product using enforceable sales
   records as defined in § 799;
   
   
   
   			(3)	Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department the validity of the
   enforceable sales based on enforceable sales records provided by the contact
   persons or the responsible ACP party;
   
   
   
   			(4)	Calculate the percentage of the District of Columbia gross sales, as
   defined in § 799, that is comprised of enforceable sales; and
   
   
   
   			(5)	Determine which ACP products have enforceable sales that are
   seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the District of Columbia gross sales.
   Only ACP products meeting these criteria shall be allowed to be sold in the
   District of Columbia under an ACP;
   
   
   
   (e)	For each of the ACP products identified in subparagraph (d)(5) of this
   subsection:

   	(2)		The VOC content and LVP content for each product for the following time
   periods:
   
   
   
   			(A)		At the time the application for an ACP is submitted; and
   
   
   
   			(B)		At any time within the four (4) years before the date of submittal of
   the application for an ACP, if either the VOC or LVP contents have varied by
   more than plus or minus ten percent (+/- 10%) of the VOC or LVP contents
   reported in § 735.4(e)(2)(A);

   after the date an approved ACP is signed by the Department;
   
   
   
   (g)	An operational plan covering all the products identified under
   subparagraph (d)(5) of this subsection for each compliance period that the ACP
   will be in effect. The operational plan shall contain all of the following:
   
   
   
   (1)	An identification of the compliance periods and dates for the responsible
   ACP party to report the information required by the Department in the ACP
   Agreement approving an ACP:
   
   
   
   (A)		The length of the compliance period shall be chosen by the responsible
   ACP party provided, however, that no compliance period shall be longer than
   three hundred sixty-five (365) days; and
   
   
   
   (B)		The responsible ACP party shall also choose the dates for reporting
   information such that all required VOC content and enforceable sales data for
   ACP products shall be reported to the Department at the same time and at the
   same frequency;

   reductions to the small business or one-product business upon approval of the
   ACP;
   
   
   
   (4)	For each ACP product, all VOC content levels which will be applicable for
   the ACP product during each compliance period;
   
   
   
   (5)	The plan shall also identify the specific method(s) by which the VOC
   content will be determined and the statistical accuracy and precision,
   including repeatability and reproducibility, calculated for each specified
   method;
   
   
   
   (6)	The projected enforceable sales for each ACP product and the different VOC
   contents for each compliance period that the ACP will be in effect;
   
   
   
   (7)	A detailed demonstration showing the combination of specific ACP

   that the ACP emissions will not exceed the ACP limit for each compliance
   period that the ACP will be in effect, the approximate date within each
   compliance period that such reformulations or surplus trading are expected to
   occur, and the extent to which the VOC contents of the ACP products will be
   reduced (such as, by ACP reformulation);
   
   
   
   (A)	This demonstration shall use the equations specified in § 799 for
   projecting the ACP emissions and ACP limits during each compliance period; and

   (11)	A plan for reconciling shortfalls that commits the responsible ACP party
   to completely reconcile any shortfalls in all cases, even, to the extent
   permitted by law, if the responsible ACP party files for bankruptcy
   protection. The plan for reconciliation of shortfalls shall contain:
   
   
   
   (A)	A clear and convincing demonstration of how shortfalls of up to five, ten,
   fifteen, twenty-five, fifty, seventy-five, and one hundred percent (5%, 10%,
   15%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) of the applicable ACP Limit will be completely
   reconciled within ninety (90) days from the date the shortfall is determined;
   
   
   
   (B)	A listing of the specific records and other information that will be
   necessary to verify that the shortfalls were reconciled as specified in this
   paragraph; and
   
   
   
   (C)	A commitment to provide any record or information requested by the
   Department to verify that the shortfalls have been completely reconciled; and

   ACP application are true and correct.
   
   
   
   735.5 		In accordance with the time periods specified in § 735.7, the
   Department shall issue an ACP Agreement approving an ACP application that
   meets the requirements of §§ 719 through 737. The Department shall specify
   such terms and conditions as are necessary to ensure that the emissions from
   the ACP products do not exceed the emissions that would have occurred if the
   ACP products subject to the ACP had met the VOC standards specified in the
   Table of Standards in § 720.1. The ACP Agreement shall also include:
   
   
   
   (a)	Only those ACP products for which the enforceable sales are at least
   seventy-five percent (75%) of the District of Columbia gross sales, as
   determined in § 735.4(d);
   
   
   
   (b)	A reconciliation of shortfalls plan meeting the requirements of §
   735.4(g)(11); and
   
   
   
   (c)	Operational terms, conditions, and data to be reported to the Department
   to ensure that all requirements of §§ 719 through 736 are met.

   735.6. The Department shall not approve an ACP submitted by a responsible ACP
   party if the Department determines, upon review of the responsible ACP
   party&#8217;s compliance history with past or current ACPs or the requirements
   for consumer products in §§ 719 through 731, that the responsible ACP party
   has a recurring pattern of violations and has consistently refused to take the
   necessary steps to correct those violations.
   
   
   
   735.7   	Unless the Department and the responsible party mutually agree to a
   different period of action, the Department shall take appropriate action on an
   ACP application within the following time periods:
   
   
   
   (a)	Within thirty (30) days of receipt of an ACP application, the Department
   shall inform the applicant in writing that either:
   
   
   
   (1)	The application is complete and accepted for filing; or
   
   
   
   (2)	The application is deficient, and the Department shall identify the
   specific information required to make the application complete;
   
   
   
   	 	 (b)	Within thirty (30) days of receipt of additional information provided
   in response to a determination that an ACP application is deficient, the
   Department shall inform the applicant in writing that either:
   
   
   
     	(1)		The additional information is sufficient to make the application
   complete, and the application is accepted for filing; or
   
   
   
     	(2)		The application is deficient, and the Department shall identify the
   specific information required to make the application complete;
   
   
   
   (c)	The Department shall act to approve or disapprove a complete application
   within ninety (90) days after the application is deemed complete.

   735.8. All information specified in the ACP Agreement shall be maintained by
   the responsible ACP party for a minimum of three (3) years after such records
   are generated and shall meet the following requirements:
   
   
   
   		(a)	Such records shall be clearly legible and maintained in good condition
   during this period; and
   
   
   
   	(b)	The records specified in § 735.4 shall be made available to the
   Department:
   
   
   
   		(1)		Immediately upon request, during an on-site visit to a responsible ACP
   party;
   
   
   
   		(2)		Within five (5) working days after receipt of a written request from
   the Department; or
   
   
   
   		(3)		Within a time period mutually agreed upon by both the Department and
   the responsible ACP party.
   
   
   
   735.9 		Any person who commits a violation of this chapter is subject to the
   penalties specified in 20 DCMR § 105. Failure to meet any condition of an
   applicable ACP Agreement shall constitute a single, separate violation for
   each day until such requirement or condition is satisfied, unless otherwise
   provided in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this subsection:
   
   
   
   (a) 	False reporting of any information contained in an ACP application, or
   any supporting documentation or amendments thereto shall constitute a single,
   separate violation for each day that the approved ACP is in effect;
   
   
   
   (b) 	Any exceedance during the applicable compliance period of the VOC content
   specified for an ACP product and which is included in the ACP Agreement
   approving an ACP shall constitute a single, separate violation for each ACP
   product which exceeds the specified VOC content that is sold, supplied,
   offered for sale, or manufactured for use in the District of Columbia;
   
   
   
   (c) 	Any of the following actions shall each constitute a single, separate
   violation for each day after the applicable deadline until the requirement is
   satisfied:
   
   
   
   (1) 		Failure to report data to the Department, including but not limited to
   missing data, or failure to report data accurately in writing regarding the
   VOC content, LVP content, enforceable sales, or any other information required
   by any deadline specified in the applicable ACP Agreement;
   
   
   
   		(2) 		False reporting of any information submitted to the Department for
   determining compliance with the ACP requirements;
   
   
   
   		(3)		Failure to completely implement the reconciliation of shortfalls plan
   that is set forth in the ACP Agreement, within thirty (30) days from the date
   of written notification of a shortfall by the Department; and
   
   
   
   		(4)		Failure to completely reconcile the shortfall as specified in the ACP
   Agreement, within ninety (90) days from the date of written notification of a
   shortfall by the Department;
   
   
   
   	(d) 	False reporting or failure to report any of the information specified in
   § 735.10, or the sale or transfer of invalid surplus reductions, shall
   constitute a single, separate violation for each day during the time period
   for which the surplus reductions are claimed to be valid;
   
   
   
   	(e) 	Except as provided in § 735.9(f), any exceedance of the ACP limit for
   any compliance period that the ACP is in effect shall constitute a single,
   separate violation for each day of the applicable compliance period. The
   Department shall determine whether an exceedance of the ACP limit has occurred
   as follows:
   
   
   
   (1) 	If the responsible ACP party has provided all required information for
   the applicable compliance period specified in the ACP Agreement approving an
   ACP, then the Department shall determine whether an exceedance has occurred
   using the enforceable sales records and VOC content for each ACP product, as
   reported by the responsible ACP party for the applicable compliance period;
   and
   
   
   
   		(2) 		If the responsible ACP party has failed to provide all the required
   information specified in the ACP Agreement for an applicable compliance
   period, the Department shall determine whether an exceedance of the ACP limit
   has occurred as follows:
   
   
   
   		(A) 	For the missing data days, the Department shall calculate the total
   maximum historical emissions, as specified in § 799;
   
   
   
   		(B)		For the remaining portion of the compliance period which are not
   missing data days, the Department shall calculate the emissions for each ACP
   product using the enforceable sales records and VOC content that were reported
   for that portion of the applicable compliance period;
   
   
   
   		(C) 	The ACP emissions for the entire compliance period shall be the sum of
   the total maximum historical emissions, determined pursuant to subparagraph
   (e)(2)(A) of this subsection, and the emissions determined pursuant to
   subparagraph (e)(2)(B) of this subsection;
   
   
   
   				(D) 	The Department shall calculate the ACP limit for the entire
   compliance period using the ACP standards applicable to each ACP product and
   the enforceable sales records specified in subparagraph (e)(2)(B) of this
   subsection. The enforceable sales for each ACP product during missing data
   days, as specified in subparagraph (e)(2)(A) of this subsection, shall be zero
   (0); and
   
   
   
   		(E) 	An exceedance of the ACP limit has occurred when the ACP emissions,
   determined pursuant to subparagraph (e)(2)(C) of this subsection exceeds the
   ACP limit, determined pursuant to subparagraph (e)(2)(D) of this subsection;
   
   
   
   	(f) 		If a violation specified in paragraph (e) of this section occurs, the
   responsible ACP party may, pursuant to this paragraph, establish the number of
   violations as calculated according to the following equation:
   
   
   
   		NEV = (ACP Emissions &#8211; ACP Limit) x 1 Violation/40 Pounds
   
   
   
   		where:
   
   
   
   NEV	= number of ACP Limit violations;
   
   
   
   ACP Emissions	= the ACP Emissions for the compliance period;
   
   
   
   ACP Limit	= the ACP Limit for the compliance period; and
   
   
   
   	   		 		The responsible ACP party may determine the number of ACP Limit
   violations pursuant to this paragraph only if it has provided all required
   information for the applicable compliance period, as specified in the ACP
   Agreement approving the ACP. By choosing this option, the responsible ACP
   party waives all legal objections to the calculation of the ACP Limit
   violations pursuant to this subsection;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   In assessing the amount of penalties for any violation occurring pursuant to
   paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, the circumstances identified in
   applicable District of Columbia health and safety laws and regulations shall
   be taken into consideration;
   
   
   
   (h)	A cause of action against a responsible party under this section shall be
   deemed to accrue on the date(s) when the records establishing the violation
   are received by the Department or when documents are not received as requested
   by the Department; and
   
   
   
   (i) 	The responsible ACP party is fully liable for compliance with the
   requirements of this subsection, even if the responsible ACP party contracts
   with or otherwise relies on another person to carry out some or all of the
   requirements of this subsection.

   735.10. The Department shall issue surplus reduction certificates, which
   establish and quantify, to the nearest pound of VOC reduced, any surplus
   reductions achieved by a responsible ACP party operating under an ACP. All
   surplus reductions shall be calculated by the Department at the end of each
   compliance period within the time specified in the approved ACP. Surplus
   reductions can be bought from, sold to, or transferred to a responsible ACP
   party operating under an ACP, according to the following provisions:
   
   
   
   (a)	Surplus reduction certificates shall not constitute instruments,
   securities, or any other form of property;
   
   
   
   (b)	For the purposes of this regulation, VOC reductions from sources of VOCs
   other than consumer products subject to the VOC standards specified in the
   Table of Standards in § 720.1 may not be used to generate surplus reductions;
   
   
   
   		(c)	Surplus reductions are valid only when generated by a responsible ACP
   party and only while that responsible ACP party is operating under an approved
   ACP;
   
   
   
   		(d) 	Surplus reductions are valid only after the Department has issued an
   ACP Agreement pursuant to § 735;
   
   
   
   		(e) 	Surplus reductions issued by the Department may be used by the
   responsible ACP party who generated the surplus until, pursuant to § 735.17:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The reductions expire;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The reductions are traded; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The ACP is canceled;
   
   
   
   		(f) 	Surplus reductions cannot be applied retroactively to any compliance
   period before the compliance period in which the reductions were generated;
   
   
   
   		(g) 	Only small or one-product businesses selling products under an approved
   ACP may purchase surplus reductions, except as provided in § 735.10(h)(2). An
   increase in the size of a small business or one-product business shall have no
   effect on surplus reductions purchased by that business before the date of the
   increase;
   
   
   
   		(h)	While valid, surplus reductions may be used only for the following
   purposes:
   
   
   
   (1) 	To adjust the ACP emissions of either the responsible ACP party who
   generated the reductions or the responsible ACP party to which the reductions
   were traded, provided the surplus reductions are not to be used by any
   responsible ACP party to further lower its ACP emissions when its ACP
   emissions are equal to or less than the ACP limit during the applicable
   compliance period; or
   
   
   
   (2) 	To be traded for the purpose of reconciling another responsible ACP
   party&#8217;s shortfalls, provided such reconciliation is part of the
   reconciliation of shortfalls plan approved by the Department pursuant to §
   735.4(g)(11);
   
   
   
   		(i) 	A valid surplus reduction shall be in effect starting five (5) days
   after the date of issuance by the Department, for a continuous period equal to
   the number of days in the compliance period during which the surplus reduction
   was generated. The surplus reduction shall then expire at the end of its
   effective period;
   
   
   
   		(j) 	At least five (5) working days before the effective date of transfer of
   surplus reductions, both the responsible ACP party that is selling surplus
   reductions and the responsible ACP party that is buying the surplus reductions
   shall, either together or separately, notify the Department in writing of the
   transfer. The notification shall include all of the following:
   
   
   
   (1) 	The date the transfer is to become effective;
   
   
   
   (2) 	The date the surplus reductions being traded are due to expire;
   
   
   
   (3) 	The amount in pounds of VOCs of surplus reductions that are being
   transferred;
   
   
   
   (4) 	The total purchase price paid by the buyer for the surplus reductions;
   
   
   
   (5) 	The contact persons, names of the companies, street and mail addresses,
   and telephone numbers of the responsible ACP parties involved in the trading
   of the surplus reductions; and
   
   
   
   (6) 	A copy of the District of Columbia-issued surplus reductions certificate,
   signed by both the seller and buyer of the certificate, showing transfer of
   all or a specified portion of the surplus reductions;
   
   
   
   (A)	The copy shall show the amount of any remaining non-traded surplus
   reductions, if applicable, and their expiration date; and
   
   
   
   (B)	The copy shall indicate that both the buyer and seller of the surplus
   reductions fully understand the conditions and limitations placed upon the
   transfer of the surplus reductions and accept full responsibility for the
   appropriate use of such surplus reductions as provided in this section; and
   
   
   
   		(k)	Surplus reduction credits shall only be traded between ACP parties for
   consumer products.

   735.11. The use of limited-use surplus reduction credits for early
   reformulations of ACP products shall comply with the following provisions:
   
   
   
   		(a) 	For the purposes of this section, early reformulation means an ACP
   product that is reformulated to result in a reduction in the product&#8217;s
   VOC content, and which is sold, supplied, or offered for sale in the District
   of Columbia for the first time during the three hundred sixty-five (365) day
   period immediately before the date wherein the application for a proposed ACP
   is submitted to the District. Early reformulation does not include any
   reformulated ACP product that is sold, supplied, or offered for sale in the
   District of Columbia more than one (1) year before the date on which the ACP
   application is submitted to the Department;
   
   
   
   		(b)	If requested in the application for an ACP, the Department shall, upon
   approval of the ACP, issue surplus reduction credits for early reformulations
   of ACP products, provided that all of the following documentation has been
   submitted by the responsible ACP party to the satisfaction of the Department:
   
   
   
   	(1) 	Accurate documentation showing that the early reformulation reduced the
   VOC content of the ACP product to a level that is below the pre-ACP VOC
   content of the product, or below the applicable VOC standard specified in the
   Table of Standards in § 720.1, whichever is the lesser of the two;
   
   
   
   	(2) 	Accurate documentation demonstrating that the early reformulated ACP
   product was sold in District of Columbia retail outlets within the time period
   specified in paragraph (a) of this section;
   
   
   
   	(3) 	Accurate sales records for the early reformulated ACP product that meet
   the definition of enforceable sales records as defined in § 799, and which
   demonstrate that the enforceable sales for the ACP product are at least
   seventy-five percent (75%) of the District of Columbia gross sales for the
   product, as specified in § 735.4(d); and
   
   
   
   	(4) 	Accurate documentation for the early reformulated ACP product that meets
   the requirements specified in § 735.4(c)-(d), § 735.4(g)(8)-(9), and which
   identifies the specific test methods for verifying the claimed early
   reformulation(s) and the statistical accuracy and precision of the test
   methods as specified in § 735.4(g)(4)-(5);
   
   
   
   (c) 	Surplus reduction credits issued pursuant to this section shall be
   calculated separately for each early reformulated ACP product by the
   Department according to the following equation:
   
   
   
   					SR = Enforceable Sales x ((VOC Content)initial (VOC Content)final) 100
   
   					where:
   
   
   
   SR		= Surplus Reductions for the ACP product, expressed to the nearest pound;
   
   		Enforceable
   
   			Sales		= the Enforceable Sales for the early reformulated ACP product,
   expressed to the nearest pound of ACP product;
   
   			VOC
   
   			Contentinitial	= the Pre-ACP VOC content of the ACP product, or the
   applicable VOC standard specified in §720, whichever is the lesser of the
   two, expressed to the nearest one tenth of a pound (0.1 lb.) of VOC per one
   hundred pounds (100 lb.) of ACP product;
   
   		VOC
   
   			Contentfinal	= the VOC Content of the early reformulated ACP product after
   the early reformulation is achieved, expressed to the nearest one tenth of a
   pound (0.1 lb.) of VOC per one hundred pounds (100 lb.) of ACP product; and
   
   
   
   		(d) 	The use of surplus reduction credits issued pursuant to this section
   shall be subject to all of the following provisions:
   
   
   
   	(1) 		Surplus reduction credits shall be used solely to reconcile the
   responsible ACP party&#8217;s shortfalls, if any, generated during the first
   compliance period occurring immediately after the issuance of the ACP
   Agreement approving an ACP, and shall not be used for any other purpose;

   other responsible ACP party; and
   
   
   
   	(3) 		Except as provided in this section, surplus reduction credits shall be
   subject to all requirements applicable to surplus reductions and surplus
   trading, as specified in § 735.10.

   735.12. At the end of each compliance period, the responsible ACP party shall
   make an initial calculation of any shortfalls occurring in that compliance
   period, as specified in the ACP Agreement approving the ACP. Upon receipt of
   this information, the Department shall determine the amount of any shortfall
   that has occurred during the compliance period, and shall notify the
   responsible ACP party of this determination:

   any change in an ACP product&#8217;s name, formulation, form, function,
   applicable product categories, VOC content, LVP content, date-codes, or
   recommended product usage directions, no later than fifteen (15) days from the
   date such a change occurs. These modifications do not need Department
