                                  DC REGULATIONS

ARCHITECTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL MAINTENANCE COATING – STANDARDS (§ 20-774)

774.1. No person shall manufacture, blend, supply, sell, offer for sale,
   apply, or solicit the application of any architectural coating with a VOC
   content in excess of the corresponding limit specified in the Table of
   Standards in § 774.10, except as provided in §§ 774.2, 774.3, 774.8, and
   774.10.
   
   
   
   774.2 	The most restrictive VOC content limit shall apply if anywhere on the
   container of any architectural coating, or any label or sticker affixed to the
   container, or in any sales, advertising, or technical literature supplied by a
   manufacturer or anyone acting on their behalf, any representation is made that
   indicates that the coating meets the definition of or is recommended for use
   for more than one (1) of the coating categories listed in the Table of
   Standards in § 774.10. This provision does not apply to the following coating
   categories:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Lacquer coatings (including lacquer sanding sealers);
   
   
   
   (b)	Metallic pigmented coatings;
   
   
   
   (c)	Shellacs;
   
   
   
   (d)	Fireretardant coatings;
   
   
   
   (e)	Pretreatment wash primers;
   
   
   
   (f)	Industrial maintenance coatings;
   
   
   
   (g)	Lowsolids coatings;
   
   
   
   (h)	Wood preservatives;
   
   
   
   (i)	Hightemperature coatings;
   
   
   
   (j)	Temperatureindicator safety coatings;
   
   
   
   (k)	Antenna coatings;
   
   
   
   (l)	Antifouling coatings;
   
   
   
   (m)	Flow coatings;
   
   
   
   (n)	Bituminous roof primers;
   
   
   
   (o)	Specialty primers, sealers, and undercoaters;
   
   
   
   (p)	Thermoplastic rubber coating and mastic;
   
   
   
   (q)	Calcimine recoaters;
   
   
   
   (r)	Impacted immersion coatings;
   
   
   
   (s)	Nuclear coatings; and
   
   
   
   (t)	Concrete surface retarders.

   774.3. A coating manufactured before the effective date specified for that
   coating in the Table of Standards in § 774.10, may be sold, supplied, or
   offered for sale after the specified effective date. In addition, a coating
   manufactured before the effective date specified for that coating in the Table
   of Standards in § 774.10 may be applied at any time, both before and after
   the specified effective date, so long as the coating complied with the
   standards in effect at the time the coating was manufactured. This subsection
   does not apply to any coating that does not display the date or date code
   required by § 776.1(a).

   774.4. All architectural coating containers used to apply the contents therein
   to a surface directly from the container by pouring, siphoning, brushing,
   rolling, padding, ragging, or other means shall be closed when not in use.
   These architectural coatings containers include, but are not limited to:
   
   
   
   (a) 	Drums, buckets, cans, pails, trays, or other application containers; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Containers of any VOCcontaining materials used for thinning and cleanup
   shall also be closed when not in use.

   774.5. No person who applies or solicits the application of any architectural
   coating shall apply a coating that is thinned to exceed the applicable VOC
   limit specified in the Table of Standards in § 774.10.

   774.6. No person shall apply or solicit the application of any rust preventive
   coating for industrial use, unless such a rust preventive coating complies
   with the industrial maintenance coating VOC limit specified in the Table of
   Standards in § 774.10.

   774.7. For any coating that does not meet any of the definitions for the
   specialty coatings categories listed in the Table of Standards in § 774.10,
   the VOC content limit shall be determined by classifying the coating as a flat
   coating or a nonflat coating, based on its gloss, as defined in § 799, and
   the corresponding flat or nonflat coating limit shall apply.

   774.8. A manufacturer, seller, or user of an industrial maintenance coating
   may petition the Department to apply an industrial maintenance coating with a
   VOC content greater than three hundred forty gallons per liter (340 g./L) if
   all of the following conditions are met:
   
   
   
   (a)	The industrial maintenance coating is applied outside the ozone season,
   normally May through September every year;
   
   
   
   (b)	The petition submitted to the Department shall contain the following
   information, as applicable: job requirements and descriptions, volume of
   coating, maximum VOC content, and a certification that a complying coating
   meeting the job performance requirements is not available; and
   
   
   
   (c)	If the Department grants written approval, such approval shall contain
   volume and VOC limit conditions. Until written approval is granted by the
   Department and received by the petitioner, all provisions of this section
   shall apply.

   774.9. The Department shall not approve any petition under § 774.8 if the
   approvals previously granted by the Department during the calendar year, when
   combined with the petition under consideration, would result in excess VOC
   emissions for that calendar year that would exceed five percent (5%) of the
   annual emission reduction achieved within the District of Columbia from
   implementing the January 1, 2005, VOC limit for industrial maintenance
   coatings. Coatings subject to this provision shall be sold only if an approved
   petition (or a copy of it) is provided before the sale. Coatings subject to
   this provision shall not be available to the general public.

   774.10. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 774.1, a person or facility may
   add up to ten percent (10%) by volume of VOC to a lacquer to avoid blushing of
   the finish during days with relative humidity greater than seventy percent
   (70%) and temperature below sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit (65° F) or eighteen
   degrees Celsius (18º C) at the time of application, provided that the coating
   contains acetone and no more than five hundred fifty grams (550 g.) of VOC per
   liter of coating, less water and exempt compounds, before the addition of VOC.

    Limits are expressed in grams of VOC per liter of coating thinned to the
   manufacturer&#8217;s maximum recommendation, excluding the volume of any
   water, exempt compounds, or colorant added to tint bases.  Manufacturer’s
   maximum recommendation means the maximum recommendation for thinning that is
   indicated on the label or lid of the coating container.
   
   
   
    Conversion factor: one pound VOC per gallon (U.S.) is equivalent to one
   hundred nineteen and ninety-five one hundredths grams per liter (119.95 g/L).
   
    Units for this coating are grams of VOC per liter (pounds of VOC/gallon) of
   coating, including water and exempt compounds
