   * The VOC content is determined as the weight of VOCs,
   
    less water and exempt compounds as specified in §747.

   744.3. The VOC content limits in the Table of Standards in § 744.2 for
   adhesives applied to particular substrates (such as, Category 5), shall apply
   as follows:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   If an operator uses an adhesive or sealant subject to a specific VOC content
   limit for such adhesive or sealant in the Table of Standards in § 744.2, such
   specific limit applies rather than an adhesive-to-substrate limit; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   If an adhesive is used to bond dissimilar substrates together, the applicable
   substrate category with the highest VOC content shall be the limit for such
   use.
   
   
   
   744.4 	Except as provided in §§ 744.5 and 745, any person subject to §§
   743 to 749 using a surface preparation or cleanup solvent shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section for single-ply
   roofing, not use materials containing VOCs for surface preparation, unless the
   VOC content of the surface preparation solvent is less than seventy grams per
   liter (70 g./L);
   
   
   
   (b)	If a surface preparation solvent is used in applying single-ply roofing,
   not use materials for surface preparation containing VOCs, unless the
   composite vapor pressure of the surface preparation solvent, excluding water
   and exempt compounds, does not exceed forty-five millimeters of mercury (45
   mm. Hg) at twenty degrees Celsius (20º C) or sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit
   (68° F);
   
   
   
   (c)	Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, not use materials
   containing VOCs for the removal of adhesives, sealants, or adhesive or sealant
   primers from surfaces, other than spray application equipment, unless the
   composite vapor pressure of the solvent used, excluding water and exempt
   compounds, is less than forty-five millimeters of mercury (45 mm. Hg) at
   twenty degrees Celsius (20º C) or sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit (68° F);
   and
   
   
   
   (d)	Remove an adhesive, sealant, adhesive primer, or sealant primer from the
   parts of spray application equipment by:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   An enclosed cleaning system, or an equivalent cleaning system as determined by
   the SCAQMD’s “General Test Method for Determining Solvent Losses from
   Spray Gun Cleaning Systems,” dated October 3, 1989;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Using a solvent with a VOC content of seventy grams (70 g) of VOC per liter of
   material, or less; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Soaking parts containing dried adhesive in a solvent as long as the composite
   vapor pressure, excluding water and exempt compounds, of the solvent is nine
   and one half millimeters of mercury (9.5 mm. Hg) at twenty degrees Celsius
   (20º C) or sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit (68° F) or less and is kept in a
   closed container, which shall be closed except when depositing or removing
   parts of materials from the container.

   744.5. A person using an adhesive, sealant, adhesive primer, or sealant primer
   subject to §§ 743 to 749 may comply with § 744.2 and 744.4 using add-on air
   pollution control equipment if such equipment meets the following
   requirements:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The VOC emissions from the use of all adhesives, sealants, adhesive primers,
   or sealant primers subject to §§ 743 to 749 are reduced by an overall
   capture and control efficiency of at least eighty-five percent (85%) by
   weight;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The combustion temperature is continuously monitored if a thermal incinerator
   is operated;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Inlet and exhaust gas temperatures are continuously monitored if a catalytic
   incinerator is operated;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Control device efficiency is continuously monitored when a carbon absorber or
   control device other than a thermal or catalytic incinerator is operated; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Operation records sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the requirements
   of this section are maintained as required by § 746.
   
   
   
   744.6 	Any person using adhesives, sealants, adhesive primers, sealant
   primers, or surface preparation or cleanup solvents subject to §§ 743 to 749
   shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	Store or dispose of all absorbent materials, such as cloth or paper, which
   are moistened with adhesives, sealants, primers, or solvents subject to §§
   743 to 749, in non-absorbent containers that shall be closed except when
   placing materials in or removing materials from the container;
   
   
   
   (b)	Store all VOC-containing adhesives, sealants, adhesive primers, sealant
   primers, surface preparation and cleanup solvents, and related waste materials
   in closed containers;
   
   
   
   (c)	Ensure that mixing and storage containers used for VOC-containing
   adhesives, sealants, adhesive primers, sealant primers, surface preparation
   and cleanup solvents, and related waste materials are kept closed at all times
   except when depositing or removing these materials;
   
   
   
   (d)	Minimize spills of VOC-containing adhesives, sealants, adhesive primers,
   sealant primers, surface preparation and cleanup solvents, and related waste
   materials;
   
   
   
   (e) 	Convey VOC-containing adhesives, sealants, adhesive primers, sealant
   primers, surface preparation and cleanup solvents, and related waste materials
   from one location to another in closed containers or pipes; and
   
   
   
   (f)	Minimize VOC emission from cleaning of application, storage, mixing, and
   conveying equipment by ensuring that equipment cleaning is performed without
   atomizing the cleaning solvent and all spent solvent is captured in closed
   containers.

   744.7. No person shall solicit, require the use or specify the application of
   any adhesive, sealant, adhesive primer, sealant primer, surface preparation or
   cleanup solvent if such use or application results in a violation of the
   provisions of 20 DCMR chapter 7. The prohibition of this subdivision shall
   apply to all written or oral contracts under which any adhesive, sealant,
   adhesive primer, sealant primer, and surface preparation or cleanup solvent
   subject to §§ 743 to 749 is to be used at any location in the District of
   Columbia.
