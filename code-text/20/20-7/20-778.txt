                                  DC REGULATIONS

ARCHITECTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL MAINTENANCE COATING – TESTING REQUIREMENTS (§
20-778)

778.1. For the purpose of determining compliance with the VOC content limits
   in the Table of Standards in § 774.10, the VOC content of a coating shall be
   determined by using the procedures described below in paragraphs (a) or (b),
   as appropriate. The VOC content of a tint base shall be determined without
   colorant that is added after the tint base is manufactured as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	With the exception of low solids coatings, determine the VOC content in
   grams of VOC per liter of coating thinned to the manufacturer&#8217;s maximum
   recommendation, excluding the volume of any water and exempt compounds.
   Determine the VOC content using the following equation:
   
   
   
   VOC Content 	= 	(Ws  Ww  Wec)
   
    				(Vm  Vw  Vec)
   
   
   
   where:
   
   
   
   VOC content 	= grams of VOC per liter of coating;
   
   
   
   Ws		= weight of volatiles, in grams;
   
   
   
   Ww		= weight of water, in grams;
   
   
   
   Wec		= weight of exempt compounds, in grams;
   
   
   
   Vm		= volume of coating, in liters;
   
   
   
   Vw		= volume of water, in liters; and
   
   
   
   Vec		= volume of exempt compounds, in liters; or
   
   
   
   (b)	For low solids coatings, determine the VOC content in units of grams of
   VOC per liter of coating thinned to the manufacturer&#8217;s maximum
   recommendation, including the volume of any water and exempt compounds.
   Determine the VOC content using the following equation:
   
   
   
   VOC Content (ls) =	(Ws  Ww  Wec)
   
   (Vm)
   
   
   
   where:
   
   
   
   VOC Content (ls) 	= the VOC content of a low solids coating in grams per liter
   of coating;
   
   
   
   Ws		= weight of volatile, in grams;
   
   
   
   Ww		= weight of water, in grams;
   
   
   
   Wec		= weight of exempt compounds, in grams; and
   
   
   
   Vm		= volume of coating, in liters.
   
   
   
   778.2 	To determine the physical properties of a coating in order to perform
   the calculations in §778.1, the reference method for VOC content is U.S. EPA
   Method 24, except as provided in § 778.3 and 778.4. An alternative method to
   determine the VOC content of coatings is SCAQMD Method 30491 (Revised February
   1996), adopted by reference in § 778.5(j). The exempt compounds content shall
   be determined by SCAQMD Method 30391 (Revised August 1996), adopted by
   reference in § 778.5(h)(3). To determine the VOC content of a coating, the
   manufacturer may use U.S. EPA Method 24, or an alternative method, as provided
   in § 778.3, formulation data, or any other reasonable means for predicting
   that the coating has been formulated as intended including but not limited to
   quality assurance checks and record keeping. However, if there are any
   inconsistencies between the results of a Method 24 test and any other means
   for determining VOC content, the Method 24 results will govern, except when an
   alternative method is approved as specified in § 778.3. The Department may
   require the manufacturer to conduct a Method 24 analysis.

   778.3. Alternative test methods may be used if they are demonstrated to
   provide results that are acceptable for purposes of determining compliance
   with § 778.2, and have been reviewed and approved in writing by the
   Department and the U.S. EPA.
   
   
   
   778.4 	Analysis of methacrylate multicomponent coatings used as traffic
   marking coatings shall be conducted according to a modification of U.S. EPA
   Method 24 in 40 C.F.R. Part 59, Subpart D, Appendix A. This method has not
   been approved for methacrylate multi-component coatings used for purposes
   other than traffic marking coatings or other classes of multi-component
   coatings.
   
   
   
   778.5 	The following test methods are incorporated by reference herein, and
   shall be used to test coatings subject to the provisions of §§ 773 through
   778:

   Curing, or Film Formation of Organic Coatings at Room Temperature, (see §
   799, quick dry enamel and quickdry primer, sealer, and undercoater). The tack
   free time of a quickdry enamel coating shall be determined by the Mechanical
   Test Method of ASTM Designation D 164095;
   
   
   
   (g)	The chalkiness of a surface shall be determined using ASTM Designation D
