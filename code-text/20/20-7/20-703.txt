TERMINAL VAPOR RECOVERY &#8211; GASOLINE OR VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND (ยง
20-703)

703.1. The loading of volatile organic compounds or gasoline into any tank
   truck, trailer, or railroad tank car from any loading facility shall be
   prohibited unless the loading facility is equipped with a vapor collection and
   disposal system or its equivalent designed to collect the total organic
   compound vapors displaced during loading and in good working order and in
   operation.

   703.2. A loading procedure effected through the hatches of a tank truck,
   trailer, or railroad tank car with a loading arm equipped with a vapor
   collecting adaptor, a pneumatic hydraulic, or other mechanical means shall be
   provided to force a vapor-tight seal between the adaptor and the hatch. A
   procedure shall be provided to prevent liquid drainage from the loading device
   when it is removed from the hatch of any tank truck, trailer, or railroad tank
   car, or to accomplish complete drainage before removal.

   703.3. When loading is effected through means other than hatches, all loading
   and vapor lines shall be equipped with fittings which make vapor-tight
   connections and which close automatically when disconnected.

   703.4. The vapor disposal portion of the system shall limit the emissions to
   the atmosphere to no more than eighty (80) milligrams of total organic
   compounds per liter of product loaded and shall consist of one (1) of the
   following:
   
   
   
   (a)	A vapor-liquid absorber system with a minimum recovery efficiency of
   ninety percent (90%) by weight of all the-hydrocarbon vapors and gases
   entering the disposal system;
   
   
   
   (b)	A variable space tank, compressor, and fuel gas system of sufficient
   capacity to receive all hydrocarbon vapors and gases displaced from tank
   trucks, trailers and railroad tank cars being loaded; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Other equipment of at least ninety percent (90%) efficiency; Provided,
   that the equipment is submitted to and approved by the Mayor.

   703.5. Compliance with or violation of the emission standards in ยง 703 shall
   be determined in accordance with the procedures prescribed in Appendix A of
   &#8220;Control of Hydrocarbons from Tank Truck Gasoline Loading
   Terminals,&#8221; published by EPA, October 1977, publication numbers
   EPA-450/2-77-026 and OAQPS No. 1.2-082.

   703.6. The vapor collection and liquid loading equipment shall be designed and
   operated to prevent gauge pressure in the delivery tank from exceeding
   eighteen inches (18 in.) of water column during product loading.

   703.7. No pressure-vacuum vent in the vapor collection and disposal system
   shall begin to open at a system pressure less than eighteen inches (18 in.) of
   water column.
