                                  DC REGULATIONS

CONSUMER PRODUCTS – TEST METHODS (§ 20-734)

734.1. Testing to determine compliance with the requirements of §§ 720
   through 737 shall be performed using CARB Method 310, Determination of
   Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in Consumer Products, adopted September 25,
   1997, and as last amended on May 5, 2005, including any subsequent amendments,
   incorporated herein by reference. The requirements of Sections 3.5, 3.6, and
   3.7 of CARB Method 310 define a process for the initial determination of VOC
   content, the determination of LVP VOC status of compounds and mixtures, and
   the final determination of VOC content, and are incorporated in paragraphs (a)
   through (c) of this subsection as follows:
   
   
   
     	(a)	Pursuant to Section 3.5 of CARB Method 310, Initial Determination of
   VOC Content, the Department shall determine the VOC content pursuant to
   Sections 3.2 and 3.3 of CARB Method 310. Only those components with
   concentrations equal to or greater than one tenth of a percent (0.1%) by
   weight shall be reported:
   
   
   
   (1)	Pursuant to Section 3.5.1 of CARB Method 310, using the appropriate
   formula specified in Section 4 of CARB Method 310, the Department shall make
   an initial determination of whether the product meets the applicable VOC
   standards specified in CARB regulations. If initial results show that the
   product does not meet the applicable VOC standards, the Department may require
   additional testing to confirm the initial results;
   
   
   
   (2)	Pursuant to Section 3.5.2 of CARB Method 310, if the results obtained
   under Section 3.5.1 of CARB Method 310 show that the product does not meet the
   applicable VOC standards, the Department shall request that the product
   manufacturer or responsible party supply product formulation data:
   
   
   
   (A)	The manufacturer or responsible party shall supply the requested
   information; and
   
   
   
   (B)	Information submitted to the Department may be claimed as confidential in
   accordance with the District of Columbia confidentiality requirements in 20
   DCMR § 106;
   
   
   
   (3)	Pursuant to Section 3.5.3 of CARB Method 310, if the information supplied
   by the manufacturer or responsible party shows that the product does not meet
   the applicable VOC standards, then the Department will take appropriate
   enforcement action; and
   
   
   
   (4)	Pursuant to Section 3.5.4 of CARB Method 310, if the manufacturer or
   responsible party fails to provide formulation data as specified in Section
   3.5.2 of CARB Method 310, the initial determination of VOC content under
   Section 3.5 of CARB Method 310 shall determine if the product is in compliance
   with the applicable VOC standards. This determination may be used to establish
   a violation of District of Columbia regulations;
   
   
   
   (b)	Pursuant to Section 3.6 of CARB Method 310, Determination of the LVP-VOC
   Status of Compounds and Mixtures, Section 3.6 of CARB Method 310 does not
   apply to antiperspirants and deodorants or aerosol coating products because
   there is no LVP-VOC exemption for these products;
   
   
   
   (1)	Pursuant to Section 3.6.1 of CARB Method 310, Formulation Data, if the
   vapor pressure is unknown, the following ASTM methods may be used to determine
   the LVP-VOC status of compounds and mixtures: ASTM D 86-04b, ASTM D 850-00,
   ASTM D 1078-01, ASTM D 2879-97), as modified in Appendix B to Method 310, ASTM
   D 2887-01 and ASTM E 1719-97, including any subsequent amendments;
   
   
   
   (2)	Pursuant to Section 3.6.2 of CARB Method 310, LVP-VOC Status of Compounds
   or Mixtures, the Department will test a sample of the LVP-VOC used in the
   product formulation to determine the boiling point for a compound or for a
   mixture;
   
   
   
   (A)	If the boiling point exceeds two hundred sixteen degrees Celsius (216o C)
   or four hundred twenty-one degrees Fahrenheit (421o F), the compound or
   mixture is an LVP-VOC;
   
   
   
   (B)	If the boiling point is less than two hundred sixteen degrees Celsius
   (216o C) or four hundred twenty-one degrees Fahrenheit (421o F), then the
   weight percent of the mixture that boils above two hundred sixteen degrees
   Celsius (216o C) or four hundred twenty-one degrees Fahrenheit (421o F) is an
   LVP-VOC; and
   
   
   
   (C)	The Department will use the nearest five percent (5%) distillation cut
   that is greater than two hundred sixteen degrees Celsius (216o C) or four
   hundred twenty-one degrees Fahrenheit (421o F) as determined under Section
   3.6.1 of CARB Method 310 to determine the percentage of the mixture qualifying
   as an LVP-VOC; and
   
   
   
   (3)	Pursuant to Section 3.6.3 of CARB Method 310, Reference Method for
   Identification of LVP-VOC Compounds and Mixtures, if a product does not
   qualify as an LVP-VOC under Section 3.6.2 of CARB Method 310, the Department
   will test a sample of the compound or mixture used in a products formulation
   utilizing one or both of the following: ASTM D 2879-97, as modified in
   Appendix B to Method 310, and ASTM E 1719-97, to determine if the compound or
   mixture meets the CARB requirements in § 94508(91)(A) of Title 17 of the
   California Code of Regulations including any subsequent amendments; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Pursuant to Section 3.7 of CARB Method 310, Final Determination of VOC
   Content, if a product’s compliance status is not satisfactorily resolved
   under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 of CARB Method 310, the Department will conduct
   further analyses and testing as necessary to verify the formulation data:
   
   
   
     		(1)	Pursuant to Section 3.7.1 of CARB Method 310, if the accuracy of the
   supplied formulation data is verified and the product sample is determined to
   meet the applicable VOC standards, then no enforcement action for a violation
   of the VOC standards will be taken;
   
   
   
    		(2)	Pursuant to Section 3.7.2 of CARB Method 310, if the Department is
   unable to verify the accuracy of the supplied formulation data, then the
   Department will request that the product manufacturer or responsible party
   supply information to explain the discrepancy; and
   
   
   
   		(3)	Pursuant to Section 3.7.3 of CARB Method 310, if a discrepancy exists
   that cannot be resolved between the results of CARB Method 310 and the
   supplied formulation data, then the results of CARB Method 310 shall take
   precedence over the supplied formulation data. The results of CARB Method 310
   shall then determine if the product is in compliance with the applicable VOC
   standards, and may be used to establish a violation of District of Columbia
   regulations.

   734.2. Alternative methods that are shown to accurately determine the
   concentration of VOCs in a subject product or its emissions may be used upon
   approval of the Department.

   734.3. Testing to determine compliance with the requirements of §§ 734
   through 737 may also be demonstrated through calculation of the VOC content
   from records of the amounts of constituents used to make the product pursuant
   to the following criteria:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Compliance determinations based on these records may not be used unless the
   manufacturer of a consumer product keeps accurate records for each day of
   production of the amount and chemical composition of the individual product
   constituents. These records must be kept for at least three (3) years;
   
   
   
   (b)	For the purposes of this section, the VOC content shall be calculated
   according to the following equation:
   
   
   
   			VOC Content = B &#8211; C x 100
   
                            		 	     A
   
   	where:
   
   
   
   A	=	total net weight of unit, excluding container and packaging;
   
   
   
   	B	=	total weight of all VOCs, as defined in § 799, per unit;
   
   
   
   	C	=	total weight of VOCs exempted under § 721, per unit;
   
   
   
   (c)	If product records appear to demonstrate compliance with the VOC limits,
   but these records are contradicted by product testing performed using CARB
   Method 310, the results of CARB Method 310 shall take precedence over the
   product records and may be used to establish a violation of District of
   Columbia regulations.
   
   
   
   734.4 	Testing to determine whether a product is a liquid or solid shall be
   performed using ASTM D435990(2000)e1, including any subsequent amendments,
   which are incorporated by reference herein.

   734.5. Testing to determine compliance with the certification requirements for
   charcoal lighter material shall be performed using the procedures specified in
   the South Coast Air Quality Management District Rule 1174 Ignition Method
   Compliance Certification Protocol (February 28, 1991), including any
   subsequent amendments, which are incorporated by reference herein.

   734.6. Testing to determine distillation points of petroleum distillate-based
   charcoal lighter materials shall be performed using ASTM D8604b, including any
   subsequent amendments, which are incorporated by reference herein.
   
   
   
   734.7 	No person shall create, alter, falsify, or otherwise modify records in
   such a way that the records do not accurately reflect the constituents used to
   manufacture a product, the chemical composition of the individual product, and
   any other tests, processes, or records used in connection with product
   manufacture.
