                                  DC REGULATIONS

PETROLEUM UST SYSTEM PIPING (§ 20-6004)

6004.1. The owner or operator of a petroleum UST system shall regularly
   monitor all underground piping that contains or conveys regulated substances
   for releases, in accordance with the provisions of this section.

   6004.2. Each method of release detection for petroleum UST system piping,
   excluding heating oil tanks, shall meet the requirements of this section

   6004.3. Underground piping that conveys regulated substances under pressure
   shall be equipped with an automatic line leak detector.

   6004.4. Automatic line leak detectors which alert the operator to the presence
   of a leak by restricting or shutting off the flow of regulated substances
   through piping or triggering an audible or visual alarm may be used only if
   they detect leaks of three gallons per hour (3 gal/hr) at ten pounds per
   square inch (10 lbs/in) line pressure within one (1) hour. The owner or
   operator shall conduct an annual test of the operation of the leak detector,
   in accordance with the manufacturer&#8217;s requirements.
   
   
   
   6004.5 		Underground piping that conveys regulated substances under pressure
   shall have an annual line tightness test conducted in accordance with §6004.7
   or have monthly monitoring conducted in accordance with §6004.9.

   6004.6. Underground piping that conveys regulated substances under suction
   except those covered under 6004.8 shall either have a line tightness test
   conducted at least every three (3) years, in accordance with § 6004.7, or use
   a monthly monitoring method conducted in accordance with § 6004.9

   6004.7. Periodic line tightness testing of piping may be conducted only if it
   can detect a one-tenth gallon per hour (0.1 gal/hr) leak rate at one and
   one-half (1.5) times the operating pressure and includes testing of return
   lines as applicable.

   6004.8. No release detection shall be required for suction piping that is
   designed and constructed to meet the following standards:
   
   
   
   (a)	The below-grade piping operates at less than atmospheric pre sure;
   
   
   
   (b)	The below-grade piping is sloped so that the contents of the pipe will
   drain back into the storage tank if the suction is released;
   
   
   
   (c)	Only one (1) check valve is included in each suction line;
   
   
   
   (d)	The check valve is located directly below and as close as practical to the
   suction pump; and
   
   
   
   (e)	A method, satisfactory to the Director, is provided that allows compliance
   with the provisions of subparagraphs (b) through (d) of this subsection to be
   readily determined.

   6004.9. Any of the methods for release detection for tanks set forth in §§
   6009 through 6011 of this chapter may be used for piping, in accordance with
   the provisions of the applicable section, if the method used is designed to
   detect a release from any portion of the underground piping that contains or
   conveys regulated substances.

   6004.10. Secondary containment systems on underground piping installed or
   replaced after February 8, 2007 shall be checked for evidence of a release at
   least once every thirty (30) days using interstitial monitoring.
