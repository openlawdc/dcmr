                                  DC REGULATIONS

GROUNDWATER MONITORING (§ 20-6010)

6010.1. Testing or monitoring for regulated substances on the ground water or
   in the tank excavation zone shall meet the requirements of this section.

   6010.2. The regulated substance stored shall be immiscible in water and have a
   specific gravity of less than one (1).

   6010.3. If testing or monitoring for regulated substances on ground water, the
   ground water shall never be more than twenty feet (20&#8242;) from the ground
   surface and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil(s) between the UST system
   and the monitoring wells or devices shall not be less than one one-hundredth
   of a centimeter per second (0.01 cm/sec). The soil should consist of gravel,
   coarse to medium sand, coarse silt, or other permeable materials.

   6010.4. The slotted portion of the monitoring well casing shall be designed to
   prevent migration of natural soils or filter pack into the well and to allow
   entry of regulated substance on the water table into the well under both high
   and low ground water conditions.

   6010.5. Monitoring wells shall be sealed from the ground surface to the top of
   the filter pack.

   6010.6. Monitoring wells or devices shall intercept the excavation zone or
   shall be as close to the excavation zone as is technically feasible.

   6010.7. Before using ground-water monitoring, the owner or operator shall
   assess the excavation zone to ensure compliance with §§ 6010.2 through
   6010.6, and to establish the number and position of monitoring wells or
   devices that will detect releases within the excavation zone from any portion
   of the tank that routinely contains product. A minimum of two (2) wells shall
   be required in each excavation zone.

   6010.8. The continuous monitoring devices or manual methods used shall be
   capable of detecting the presence of at least one-eighth inch (1/8&#8243;) of
   free regulated substance on top of the ground water in a monitoring well.

   6010.9. Each monitoring well shall be clearly marked and secured to avoid
   unauthorized access and tampering.
