OTHER METHODS OF RELEASE DETECTION (§ 20-6012)

6012.1. The Director may approve an application for the use of another method
   of release detection if the owner or operator can demonstrate that the method
   is capable of detecting a release as effectively as any of the methods allowed
   in §§ 6007 through 6011 of this chapter, and meets the requirements of this
   section.

   6012.2. The alternative release detection method, or combination of methods,
   shall be capable of detecting either of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	A leak rate of two-tenths gallon per hour (0.2 gal/hour); or
   
   
   
   (b)	A release of one hundred fifty (150) gallons within a month with a
   probability of detection of not less than ninety-five percent (95%) and a
   probability of false alarm not greater than five percent (5%).

   6012.3. In comparing methods, the Director shall consider the size of release
   that the method can detect and the frequency and reliability with which it can
   be detected.

   6012.4. If an alternative method is approved, the owner or operator shall
   comply with any conditions imposed by the Director on its use to ensure the
   protection of human health and the environment.
