PETROLEUM UST SYSTEMS (§ 20-6700)

6700.1. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all owners and operators
   of petroleum underground storage tank (UST) systems, except as otherwise
   provided in this section.

   6700.2. State and federal government entities whose debts and liabilities are
   the debts and liabilities of a state or the United States or the District of
   Columbia government are exempt from the requirements of this section.

   6700.3. The requirements of this chapter do not apply to owners or operators
   of any UST system described in § 5501.3, 5502.1 or 5503.

   6700.4. If the owner and operator of a petroleum underground storage tank are
   separate persons, only the owner shall be required to demonstrate financial
   responsibility; however, both the owner and operator shall be liable for
   noncompliance.

   6700.5. An owner shall not be required to maintain financial responsibility
   under this section for an UST system after the UST system has been properly
   closed, in accordance with Chapter 61.

   6700.6. If corrective action is required before an UST or UST system is
   closed, the corrective action shall be completed in accordance with the
   applicable requirements of Chapter 62. After corrective action has been
   completed and the tank has been properly closed in accordance with Chapter 61,
   the owner shall no longer be required to demonstrate financial responsibility.

   6700.7. The amounts of demonstrated financial responsibility assurance
   required under this section shall not include legal defense costs.

   6700.8. The owner of one or more existing petroleum UST(s), who has not
   previously filed a Certification of Financial Responsibility with the
   Director, shall immediately file such a Certification of Financial
   Responsibility as described in § 6702.7, since all UST owners have been
   required to comply with the federal financial responsibility requirements
   since December 31, 1993, or earlier.

   6700.9. Within thirty (30) days after installation of a new UST, the owner of
   the petroleum UST shall file with the Director a Certification of Financial
   Responsibility as described in § 6702.7.

   6700.10. The owner of a petroleum UST system shall demonstrate financial
   responsibility for taking corrective action and for compensating third parties
   for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising
   from the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks in the
   per-occurrence amount of at least one million dollars ($ 1,000,000):
   
   
   
   (a)	For a petroleum UST that is located at a petroleum marketing facility; and
   
   
   
   (b)	For a petroleum UST that handles an average of more than ten thousand
   (10,000) gallons of petroleum per month based on annual throughput for the
   previous calendar year.

   6700.11. The owner of a petroleum UST system not covered under § 6700.10
   shall demonstrate financial responsibility for taking corrective action and
   compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by
   accidental releases arising from the operation of petroleum UST systems in the
   per-occurrence amount of five hundred thousand dollars ($ 500,000).

   6700.12. The owner of each petroleum UST shall demonstrate financial
   responsibility for taking corrective action and for compensating third parties
   for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising
   from the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks in at least the
   following annual aggregate amounts:
   
   
   
   (a)	The owner of one (1) to one hundred (100) petroleum UST&#8217;s shall
   demonstrate financial responsibility in the amount of one million dollars ($
   1,000,000); and
   
   
   
   (b)	The owner of one-hundred-one (101) or more petroleum UST&#8217;s shall
   demonstrate financial responsibility in the amount of two million dollars ($
   2,000,000).

   6700.13. For the purposes of § 6700.12 and § 6700.16 only, the term
   &#8220;petroleum UST&#8221; means a single containment unit and does not mean
   combinations of single containment units.

   6700.14. Except as provided in § 6700.15 of this section, if an owner uses
   separate mechanisms or separate combinations of mechanisms to demonstrate
   financial responsibility (for example, self-insurance for taking corrective
   action, liability insurance for compensating third parties for bodily injury
   and property damage caused by sudden accidental releases, and a separate
   policy of insurance for compensating third parties for bodily injury and
   property damage caused by non-sudden accidental releases), the amount of
   assurance provided by each separate mechanism or combination of mechanisms
   used for each purpose shall be in the full amount specified in §§ 6700.10,
   6700.11 and 6700.12 of this section.

   6700.15. If an owner uses separate mechanisms or separate combinations of
   mechanisms to demonstrate financial responsibility for different UST&#8217;s,
   the annual aggregate amount required under § 6700.12 shall be based on the
   number of tanks covered by each separate mechanism or separate combination of
   mechanisms.

   6700.16. Owners shall review the amount of aggregate assurance provided
   whenever one (1) or more additional petroleum UST&#8217;s are acquired or
   installed. If, after review, the number of petroleum UST&#8217;s for which
   financial responsibility must be demonstrated exceeds one hundred (100), the
   owner shall comply with the requirements of § 6700.12(b) of this section (at
   least two million dollars ($ 2,000,000) annual aggregate) by the anniversary
   of the date on which the mechanism demonstrating financial responsibility
   became effective. If financial responsibility is being demonstrated by a
   combination of mechanisms, the owner shall demonstrate financial
   responsibility in the amount of at least two million dollars ($ 2,000,000) of
   annual aggregate assurance by the first-occurring effective date anniversary
   of any one of the mechanisms combined (other than a financial test or
   guarantee) to provide assurance.

   6700.17. The per-occurrence and annual aggregate coverage amounts required
   under this section shall not in any way limit the liability of the owner or
   operator.
