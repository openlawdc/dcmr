                                  DC REGULATIONS

EFFECT OF AMNESTY (ยง 9-4005)

4005.1. Once amnesty is granted, all penalties and fifty percent (50%) of the
   interest otherwise due (as defined in ยง 4000.7 of this chapter), except as
   provided in ยง 4000.5, shall be waived and any civil, administrative, or
   criminal proceeding shall be barred relating to the designated tax and
   designated tax period.

   4005.2. The waiver of penalties and prohibition against prosecution shall
   apply only to those amounts of tax, and tax periods, and interest for which
   amnesty was granted.  Penalties shall be imposed and proceedings shall not be
   barred relating to any amount of tax later determined to be due in excess of
   the amnesty payments.

   4005.3. Any criminal prosecution directly relating to the designated tax and
   designated tax period shall be barred once amnesty is granted. This includes
   applicable criminal offenses defined in either the Tax Law or the Criminal
   Laws of the District of Columbia (Title 22, D.C. Code, 1981 Ed.).

   4005.4. A grant of amnesty to an applicant shall also bar any criminal
   prosecution for the designated tax and designated tax period against a
   responsible person, including an officer or employee.
