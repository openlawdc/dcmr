WAIVER OF THE FILING OF A RETURN (ยง 9-606)

606.1. Whenever the Deputy Chief Financial Officer determines that a party to
   a transfer cannot file a return, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer is
   authorized, in his or her discretion, to waive the requirement for the filing
   of a return by that party. In such cases, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer
   may require any affidavits, documents, and statements to be submitted that are
   deemed necessary by the Deputy Chief Financial Officer for a determination
   whether a waiver should be granted.

   606.2. Any waiver granted by the Deputy Chief Financial Officer to a party
   shall not, unless specifically authorized, be deemed to be a waiver as to any
   other party, and that waiver shall not affect the requirement for payment of
   the tax applicable to the transfer at the time the deed evidencing the
   transfer is submitted for recordation.

   606.3. Upon notification in writing from the Deputy Chief Financial Officer
   that a waiver has been granted, the Recorder of Deeds shall be authorized to
   record the deed (if the deed is otherwise recordable) without the filing of a
   return by the party to whom the waiver applies.
