605.1. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer may, in his or her discretion, for
   good cause shown grant to a party to a transfer a reasonable extension of time
   not to exceed six (6) months for the filing of a return by that party.

   605.2. The party seeking an extension shall apply to the Deputy Chief
   Financial Officer for the extension in writing, stating the reason(s) for the
   extension and any other information required by the Deputy Chief Financial
   Officer.

   605.3. If an extension of time for filing a return has been granted by the

   upon receipt of a return from each of the other parties to the deed and
   payment of the applicable tax, shall (if the deed evidencing the transfer is
   otherwise recordable) be authorized to record the deed without the filing of a
   return by the party to whom an extension has been granted.
