                                  DC REGULATIONS

NAKED TITLE DEEDS (ยง 9-609)

609.1. If the grantee named in a recorded deed upon which the applicable tax
   has been paid acted as a nominal grantee for the sole purpose of holding, on
   behalf of another person, naked title to the property described in the deed, a
   deed to that property subsequently executed by the nominal grantee, without
   consideration, naming as grantee the person on whose behalf the nominal
   grantee acted, shall be exempt from tax as a deed which, without additional
   consideration, confirms, corrects, modifies, or supplements a deed previously
   recorded.

   609.2. If the owners of an estate in real property have, for the sole purpose
   of changing their estate (for example, in the case of a change from a tenancy
   in common to a joint tenancy) executed a deed to a nominal grantee holding
   naked title to the property, who, in turn, and without consideration, executes
   a deed to the same owners so as to effect the change of estate desired, the
   deeds so executed shall be exempt from tax as deeds which, without additional
   consideration, confirm, correct, modify, or supplement a deed previously
   recorded.

   609.3. If an exemption is claimed under this section, the right to the
   exemption must be established to the satisfaction of the Deputy Chief
   Financial Officer upon the presentation to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer
   of such returns, documents, and other information that the Deputy Chief
   Financial Officer, in his or her discretion, may require.
