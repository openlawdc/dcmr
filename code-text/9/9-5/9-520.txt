                                  DC REGULATIONS

MERGERS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND LIQUIDATIONS (ยง 9-520)

520.1. The merger or consolidation of an entity that is subject to the
   Recordation of Economic Interests Act with another entity may result in a
   taxable transfer.
   
   
   
   Example (1): Corporation X, wholly owned by A, and which holds as its only
   asset real property in the District, merges with Corporation Y, owned by B and
   C, which holds as its only asset cash. The surviving corporation is owned
   equally by A, B, and C. The merger subjects the surviving corporation to the
   recordation tax, because a controlling interest was transferred within the
   meaning of the Act.
   
   
   
   Example (2): Corporations W, X and Y hold real property located in the
   District as their only assets. There are no identical or related ownership
   interests in any of the corporations. The three (3) corporations consolidated
   forming corporation Z owned equally by the prior shareholders of W, X and Y.
   Corporation Z is required to record the transfers and pay the tax because more
   than fifty percent (50%) of the controlling interest in each of the respective
   corporations was transferred.

   520.2. A transfer to a parent in complete liquidation of a wholly owned
   subsidiary that is subject to the Recordation of Economic Interests Act shall
   not be considered a transfer of an economic interest.
