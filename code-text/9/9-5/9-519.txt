                                  DC REGULATIONS

CONSIDERATION ALLOCABLE TO REAL PROPERTY (§ 9-519)

519.1. The deed recordation tax is imposed upon the portion of the
   consideration from a transfer of an economic interest that is allocable to the
   value of the real property held by the entity subject to the Transfer of
   Economic Interests Act.

   519.2. The allocation between the real property and the other assets of the
   entity shall be based upon the same allocation determined by the Deputy Chief
   Financial Officer to be reasonable under §§ 516.5 and 516.6 of this chapter.

   519.3. Consideration shall include the amount of any mortgage, lien or other
   encumbrance, whether or not the underlying indebtedness is assumed.
   
   
   
   Example: X corporation owns real property located in the District valued one
   million dollars ($ 1,000,000) encumbered with a three hundred thousand dollars
   ($ 300,000) mortgage, and machinery valued at five hundred thousand dollars ($
   500,000). Ninety percent (90%) of X’s gross receipts during the relevant
   period was from the real property. One hundred percent (100%) of the stock of
   X corporation is sold for one million two hundred thousand dollars ($
   1,200,000) in cash. The value of the real property, one million dollars ($
   1,000,000), is two-thirds (2/3) of the value of all of X corporation’s
   assets, one million five hundred thousand dollars ($ 1,500,000). The
   consideration includes the three hundred thousand dollars ($ 300,000) mortgage
   that was assumed. Two-thirds (2/3) of the consideration, one million dollars
   ($ 1,000,000), will be subject to the tax.

   519.4. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall determine the consideration
   allocated to the real property for each separate transaction that is
   aggregated to determine the total consideration subject to the tax.

   519.5. For aggregated transfers, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall use
   the fair market value of the properties at the time of each transfer to
   determine the total consideration subject to the tax.
   
   
   
   Example: X corporation is owned equally by A, B and C. X owns real property
   located in the District with a tax assessed value of nine hundred thousand
   dollars ($ 900,000), and assets other than real property valued at one hundred
   thousand dollars ($ 100,000). On January 15, 1990, A sells her stock to D for
   three hundred thousand dollars ($ 300,000). On June 20, 1990, X renovates the
   real property, which increases the estimated fair market value to one million
   nine hundred thousand dollars ($ 1,900,000). On August 4, 1990, B sells his
   stock to D for five hundred thousand dollars ($ 500,000). The transfer from B
   to D is a transfer of a controlling interest. The portion of the consideration
   of A&#8217;s transfer to D that is subject to the recordation tax is two
   hundred seventy thousand dollars ($ 270,000). One-tenth (1/10) of the value of
   the assets at the time of the sale, thirty thousand dollars ($ 30,000), is
   attributable to non-real property assets, therefore, one-tenth (1/10) of the
   purchase price of the stock is excluded from the tax. The portion of the
   consideration of B&#8217;s sale to D that is subject to the tax is four
   hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($ 475,000). One-twentieth (1/20) of the
   purchase price of the stock at the time of sale, twenty-five thousand dollars
   ($ 25,000), is attributable to assets other than real property and is excluded
   from the tax.
