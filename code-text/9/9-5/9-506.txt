WAIVER OF THE FILING OF A RETURN (ยง 9-506)

506.1. If the Deputy Chief Financial Officer determines that a party to a deed
   cannot file a return, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer, in his or her
   discretion, may waive the filing requirement for that party. The Deputy Chief
   Financial Officer may require any affidavits, documents, and statements to be
   submitted that the Deputy Chief Financial Officer deems necessary for a
   determination whether a waiver should be granted.

   506.2. A waiver granted to one party shall not, unless specifically stated in
   the waiver, be deemed to be a waiver as to any other party. The waiver shall
   not affect the requirement for payment of the tax on the deed at the time the
   deed is submitted for recordation.

   506.3. Upon notification in writing from the Deputy Chief Financial Officer
   that a waiver has been granted, the Recorder of Deeds is authorized to record
   the deed (if the deed is otherwise recordable) without the filing of a return
   by the party to whom the waiver applies.
