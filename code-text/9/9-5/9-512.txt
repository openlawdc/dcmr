RECORDATION OF REVOCABLE TRUST DEEDS (§ 9-512)

512.1. If the settlor of a revocable trust deed who retains a right of
   revocation exercises such right of revocation, and the trustee thereby
   executes a deed which transfers legal title from the trustee back to the
   settlor as beneficial owner, the deed shall be exempt from the deed
   recordation tax pursuant to § 302(6) of the Act (D.C. Code § 45-922(6)), as
   a deed which without additional consideration, confirms, modifies, or
   supplements a deed previously recorded.
