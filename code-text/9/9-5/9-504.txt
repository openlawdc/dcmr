                                  DC REGULATIONS

RECORDATION OF DEEDS WITHOUT FILING A RETURN (§ 9-504)

504.1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the following exempt
   deeds may be accepted for recordation without the filing of a return:
   
   
   
   (a)	A deed to property acquired by the United States or the District of
   Columbia or by an agency or instrumentality of either;
   
   
   
   (b)	A tax deed executed by the District of Columbia government pursuant to the
   provisions of law pertaining to the assessment and collection of District of
   Columbia real property taxes;
   
   
   
   (c)	Any deed, the sole purpose of which is to release property which is
   security for a debt or other obligation; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Tax deeds.

   504.2. The submission of a deed for recordation without a return shall
   constitute a representation by the parties to the deed that the deed, in all
   respects, meets the requirements of the Act and this section.

   504.3. Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 504.1 and 504.2, the Recorder of
   Deeds, in any case where a deed is submitted for recordation without a return,
   may reject the deed for recordation unless a return is filed if, in his or her
   judgment, it appears from the deed or other information in the possession of
   the Recorder of Deeds that the deed does not conform with the provisions of
   this section and that a return is required for the purpose of determining
   whether the deed is, in fact, exempt from tax.

   504.4. If the Recorder of Deeds rejects a deed for recordation under § 504.3,
   he or she shall notify the Deputy Chief Financial Officer of the action and
   the deed shall be reviewed by the Deputy Chief Financial Officer to determine
   its status.

   504.5. If the Deputy Chief Financial Officer concludes that a return is
   required, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall notify the parties to the
   deed at the addresses shown on the statement accompanying the deed, and the
   parties shall file a return.

   504.6. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall then determine whether the
   deed is exempt or taxable, and (if taxable) the amount of tax, and shall
   notify the Recorder of Deeds of the determination.

   504.7. If the deed is otherwise recordable, the Recorder of Deeds shall record
   it upon its presentation and payment of any tax determined by the Deputy Chief
   Financial Officer to be due.
