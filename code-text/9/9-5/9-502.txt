                                  DC REGULATIONS

PAYMENT OF THE RECORDATION TAX (§ 9-502)

502.1. The basis for the tax is the recordation of a deed and, except as
   otherwise provided in the Act or this chapter, the tax must be paid at the
   same time the deed is submitted for recordation.

   502.2. The measure of the tax is the consideration for the property conveyed
   by the deed.

   502.3. In accordance with § 304 of the Act (D.C. Code § 45-924), if there is
   no consideration for the property which is the subject of a deed, or where the
   consideration is nominal, consideration shall be construed to be the fair
   market value of the real property involved.

   502.4. The term &#8220;consideration,&#8221; as defined in § 302 of the Act,
   as amended, (D.C. Code § 45-921(5)), includes consideration actually paid or
   ultimately required to be paid for real property, whether that consideration
   is in the form of cash or is in some other form.

   502.5. The term &#8220;fair market value&#8221; shall have the same meaning as
   defined in D.C. Code § 47-802(4).

   502.6. The term &#8220;nominal consideration&#8217; means any price paid or
   any item exchanged in return for title to real property which bears no
   reasonable resemblance to the fair market value of the real property. Any
   consideration paid which equals less than 30% of the fair market value of the
   property shall be deemed to bear no reasonable resemblance to the fair market
   value of the property and, therefore, shall be deemed to be nominal.

   502.7. The following formula shall be applied for purposes of determining if
   the consideration paid is &#8216;nominal consideration&#8217;:
   
   
   
   The fair market value of the real property shall be multiplied by 30%. If the
   consideration paid is less than 30% of the fair market value of the real
   property for which a deed is submitted for recordation, the consideration paid
   shall be deemed to be nominal. If the consideration paid is deemed nominal,
   the recordation tax shall be based on the fair market value of the property.
   If the consideration paid is equal to or greater than 30% of the fair market
   value of the real property for which a deed is submitted for recordation, the
   consideration paid shall not be deemed to be nominal.

   502.8. Examples:
   
   
   
   1	The consideration paid as stated on the recordation tax return is $ 20,000
   and the fair market value of the property for which a deed is submitted for
   recordation is $ 75,000. 30% of the fair market value of the property is $
   22,500 ($ 75,000 X .30 = $ 22,500). Since the consideration paid is less than
   30% of the fair market value of the property, the consideration paid shall be
   deemed to be nominal. In this case, the recordation tax shall be based upon
   the fair market value of the property. Therefore, the recordation tax shall be
   computed as follows:
   
   
   
   ($ 75,000 X 100%) X .011 = $ 825 (recordation tax due)
   
   
   
   2	The consideration paid as stated on the recordation tax return is $ 40,000
   and the fair market value of the property for which a deed is submitted for
   recordation is $ 100,000. 30% of the fair market value of the property is $
   30,000 ($ 100,000 X .30 = $ 30,000). Since the consideration paid is more than
   30% of the fair market value of the property, the consideration paid shall not
   be deemed to be nominal. In this case, the recordation tax shall be based on
   the consideration paid. Therefore, the recordation tax shall be computed as
   follows:
   
   $ 40,000 X .011 = $ 440 (recordation tax due)
   
   
   
   3	The consideration paid as stated on the recordation tax return is $
   36,000.00 and the fair market value of the property for which a deed is
   submitted for recordation is $ 120,000.00. 30% of the fair market value of the
   property is $ 36,000 ($ 120,000.00 X .30 = $ 36,000.00). Since the
   consideration paid is equal to 30% of the fair market value of the property,
   the consideration paid shall not be deemed to be nominal. In this case, the
   recordation tax shall be based on the consideration paid. Therefore, the
   recordation tax shall be computed as follows:
   
   $ 36,000 X .011 = $ 396 (recordation tax due)

   502.9. If the Recorder of Deeds determines that the consideration paid is
   nominal, the recordation tax shall be determined based on the fair market
   value of the property for which a deed is submitted for recordation. The tax
   determined shall be paid at the time of recordation before the deed shall be
   accepted for recordation.

   502.10. In determining whether consideration paid is nominal, the Recorder of
   Deeds may use his discretion in considering any information available to him
   at the time of recordation from which the market value of the property may be
   determined. Such information may include, but is not limited to:
   
   
   
   a)	the current assessed value of the property;
   
   
   
   b)	a certified appraisal report that is not more than six months old;
   
   
   
   c)	a contract for sale of the property;
   
   
   
   d)	the settlement sheet for the sale of the real property; and
   
   
   
   e)	any other document upon which the fair market value of the property may be
   determined.

   502.11. Any taxpayer aggrieved by a determination made by the Recorder of
   Deeds that the consideration paid is nominal may file a claim for refund in
   accordance with the provisions of D.C. Code §§ 45-935 and 47-3310.

   502.12. Any taxpayer aggrieved by a determination made by the Recorder of
   Deeds of fair market value used to calculate the recordation tax may file a
   claim for refund in accordance with the provisions of D.C. Code §§ 45-935
   and 47-3310. Evidence of market value shall be submitted with the claim for
   refund.

   502.13. The provisions set forth in this section shall apply to all deeds
   submitted to the Recorder of Deeds for recordation, including deeds for
   foreclosure real estate transactions and deeds “in lieu of foreclosure.”
