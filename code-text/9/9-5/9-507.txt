SECURITY FOR PAYMENT OF TAX (ยง 9-507)

507.1. If it is determined that a deed submitted for recordation cannot be
   recorded by reason of failure of the parties to file a proper return or by
   reason of question about the correct amount of tax, the Deputy Chief Financial
   Officer is authorized to accept such security in such form(s) as, in the
   discretion of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer, may be necessary to ensure
   that the tax which is or may be applicable to the transfer is paid.

   507.2. Upon being notified of the acceptance of the security by the Deputy
   Chief Financial Officer, the Recorder of Deeds shall record the deed if it is
   otherwise recordable.

   507.3. After accepting the security and notifying the Recorder of Deeds, the
   Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall determine the applicable tax.

   507.4. Upon payment of the tax due, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall
   return the security to the person or persons from whom it was obtained.

   507.5. If payment of the tax is not made, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer
   shall, so far as is possible, collect the tax out of the security previously
   paid to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer. If there is any excess security,
   the Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall return that excess to the person or
   persons from whom it was obtained.

   507.6. If the security is inadequate for collection of the entire amount of
   tax, the parties to the deed shall be liable jointly and severally for the
   balance of the tax due.
