NAKED TITLE DEEDS (ยง 9-509)

509.1. Where the grantee named in a recorded deed upon which the applicable
   tax has been paid acted as a nominal grantee for the sole purpose of holding,
   on behalf of another person, naked title to the property described in the
   deed, a deed to that property subsequently executed by the nominal grantee,
   without consideration, naming as grantee the person on whose behalf the
   nominal grantee acted, shall be exempt from tax as a deed which, without
   additional consideration, confirms, corrects, modifies, or supplements a deed
   previously recorded.

   509.2. Where the owners of an estate in real property have, for the sole
   purpose of changing their estate (for example, in the case of a change from a
   tenancy in common to a joint tenancy) executed a deed to a nominal grantee
   holding naked title to the property, who, in turn, and without consideration,
   executes a deed to the same owners so as to effect the change of estate
   desired, the deeds so executed shall be exempt from tax as deeds which,
   without additional consideration, confirm, correct, modify, or supplement a
   deed previously recorded.

   509.3. Where exemption is claimed under this section, the right to the
   exemption must be established to the satisfaction of the Deputy Chief
   Financial Officer upon the presentation to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer
   of such returns, documents, and other information as the Deputy Chief
   Financial Officer, in his or her discretion, may require.
