                                  DC REGULATIONS

WAIVER OF PENALTY AND INTEREST FOR FAILURE TO FILE (§ 9-331)

331.1. If an income-expense form, any information sought under the form,
   
   	or records or documents sought to completely and accurately inform the Deputy
   Chief Financial Officer about the income or economic benefits of the
   income-producing property are not submitted in the time provided for by this
   chapter, and it is shown to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer&#8217;s
   satisfaction that the failure to provide the form, information, record, or
   document was due to reasonable cause, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall
   not add the penalty described in § 330 to the affected taxpayer&#8217;s real
   property tax bill for the next ensuing tax year.

   331.2. For the purposes of § 331.1, the phrase &#8220;reasonable cause&#8221;
   shall be construed to mean the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Those situations in which the owner of the affected property is under a
   legal disability at the time due for filing. Persons under legal disability
   are those persons who, at the time due for submission of the forms, did not
   appreciate their obligation to file and were thus unable to care for their
   property by reason of advanced age, mental illness, mental defect or physical
   incapacity;
   
   
   
   (b)	Death of the record-owner of the affected property within six (6) months
   prior to the date due for submission of the forms;
   
   
   
   (c)	Death of the agent who is retained by the taxpayer to prepare the forms,
   within six (6) months prior to the date due for submission of the forms; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Any other situation which the Office, in its discretion, considers
   appropriate for the treatment.

   331.3. A waiver of penalty and interest for failure to submit the required
   income and expense or related information or documents, in accordance with the
   provisions of this chapter, shall not be granted unless the facts and
   circumstances to justify the failure have been set forth in writing by the
   affected taxpayer and approved by the Director, Real Property Tax
   Administration.

   331.4. A request for waiver of penalty and interest under this section shall
   be submitted to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer on or before November 1st
   following the due date for submission of the income and expense form, as
   provided in § 332; provided that the request for waiver of penalty concerning
   the income-expense form due on April 1, 2009 may be submitted to the Deputy
   Chief Financial Officer through April 1, 2009.

   331.5. In addition to the submission of a request for waiver of penalty and
   interest as provided for § 331.4, the filing of an accurately completed
   income-expense form shall be a prerequisite to obtaining a waiver of penalty
   and interest.
