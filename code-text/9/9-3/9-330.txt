330.1. The provisions of §§ 330-339 implement the &#8220;District of
   Columbia Real Property Tax Revision Act of 1974,&#8221; as amended by § 5 of
   the &#8220;Residential Property Tax Relief Act of 1977&#8243; (D.C. Law 2-45;
   D.C. Code § 47-821), and are issued under the authority of § 422(d) of that
   Act and Mayor&#8217;s Order 78-168 (August 28, 1978).

   330.2. The provisions of §§ 330-339 supersede any previous requirements and
   rules regarding the filing of an income-expense form for income-producing
   properties for the 1978 reporting period and the imposition of a ten percent
   (10%) penalty for failure to file such a form under those requirements and
   rules. In addition, these rules are effective for subsequent reporting years
   until and unless superseded.

   330.3. For the purposes of §§ 330-339, the term &#8220;actual gross
   income&#8221; means the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	In the case of an affected taxpayer&#8217;s reporting on a cash basis, all
   of the income actually collected during the reporting period from rentals,
   parking, and miscellaneous sources, but not to include advance or security
   deposits, tenant reimbursements for capital improvements or reimbursements for
   casualty losses; and
   
   
   
   (b)	In the case of an affected taxpayer&#8217;s reporting on an accrual basis,
   all of the income actually accrued, during the reporting period, from rentals,
   parking, and miscellaneous sources, but not to include advance or security
   deposits, tenant reimbursements for capital improvements or reimbursements for
   casualty losses.

   330.4. An affected taxpayer under §§ 330-339 is the owner (or owners) of
   income-producing property or properties in the District who is (are) required
   to file an income-expense form under the Act and in accordance with the
   provisions of this chapter.

   330.5. Separate income-expense forms for separate income-producing properties
   are required, unless otherwise directed by the Office.

   330.6. In the following instances, there shall be added to the real property
   tax levied for the next ensuing tax year a penalty in the amount of ten
   percent (10%) of the tax:
   
   
   
   (a)	If an income-expense form is not delivered to the Office on or before
   April 15th of the year in which the forms are mailed to affected taxpayers;
   
   
   
   (b)	If any income-expense statement is timely delivered on or before April
   15th, but is either inaccurate or incomplete and, after written notice from
   the Deputy Chief Financial Officer and in the opinion of the Deputy Chief
   Financial Officer, remains inaccurate or incomplete; or
   
   
   
   (c)	If an income and expense statement is delivered after the time extended by
   the Deputy Chief Financial Officer.

   330.7. For the purposes of §§ 330-339, the word &#8220;delivered&#8221; also
   includes a timely postmark if mailed.

   330.8. Unless the postmark is illegible, no proof of a different postmark
   shall be accepted other than a registered or certified mail receipt or an
   affidavit from the proper postal representative. If the postmark is illegible,
   an affected taxpayer must submit a duly notarized affidavit which indicates a
   timely postmark.

   330.9. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed in §§ 330-339,
   the day of the act from which the designated period of time begins to run
   shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be
   included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday, in which case
   the period shall run until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday,
   Sunday, or legal holiday.

   330.10. The Office shall notify in writing affected taxpayers of the
   application of the ten percent (10%) penalty described in this section through
   the first-half or second-half real property tax bill or by any other method
   which it consider appropriate.

   330.11. The Office may apply the ten percent (10%) penalty provided for in
   these rules and regulations to either the first-half or second-half real
   property tax bill of the affected taxpayer&#8217;s next ensuing tax year, or
   through a separate billing within that tax year.

   330.12. Any information, form or documents required by §§ 330-339 to be
   submitted (postmarked) by a specified time may be hand-delivered (in place of
   mailing) to the Customer Service Center, Office of Tax and Revenue, 941 North
