                                  DC REGULATIONS

DETERMINATION OF ASSESSED VALUE OF REAL PROPERTY OWNED BY A COOPERATIVE HOUSING
ASSOCIATION (§ 9-346)

346.1. The provision of §§ 346 and 347 are adopted under authority of the
   Cooperative Housing Assessment Procedure and Lower Income Homeownership Tax
   Abatement and Incentives Act of 1983 Amendment Act of 1988 (the
   &#8220;Act&#8221;), effective March 16, 1989 (D.C. Law 7-205; D.C. Code §
   47.820.1) and Mayor&#8217;s Order 89-136.

   346.2. The assessed value of improved residential real property owned by a
   cooperative housing association, for the tax year beginning July 1, 1990, and
   for each subsequent tax year, shall be the aggregate estimated market value of
   the proprietary leases, stocks, or other interests in the cooperative housing
   association as of January 1st preceding the date of assessment, minus the
   value of all nonreal property assets owned by the cooperative housing
   association, multiplied by sixty-five percent (65%), and may be adjusted to
   take into account the factors set forth in § 421a(b) of the District of
   Columbia Real Property Tax Revision Act of 1974.

   346.3. If the Deputy Chief Financial Officer lacks sufficient information upon
   which to determine the assessed value under § 346.2, the assessed value of
   improved residential real property owned by a cooperative housing association
   shall be an amount equal to the estimated market value of the real property
   assessed as if it were a condominium determined by use of the comparable sales
   approach, multiplied by seventy percent (70%), minus all non-real property
   assets owned by the cooperative housing association, multiplied by sixty-five
   percent (65%), and may be adjusted to take into account the factors set forth
   in § 421a(b) of the District of Columbia Real Property Tax Revision Act of
   1974.

   346.4. Adjustments to the assessed value of the cooperative for units leased
   by the cooperative (including bona fide lifetime or long-term leases to
   elderly and low income tenants) shall be made by assessing the value of the
   leased units separately and adding that value to the remaining portion of the
   cooperative housing association.
   
   
   
   Example:
   
   
   
   Value of units leased to low income or
   
   
   
   
   
   elderly tenants
   
    $150,000.00
   
   
   
   Value of other leased units
   
   100,000. 00
   
   
   
   Total value of leased units
   
    $250,000.00
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Value of remaining portion of coop
   
    $10,000,000.00
   
   
   
   Total assessed value of real property
   
    $10,250,000.00

   346.5. The value of units with lifetime or long-term leases to low income and
   elderly tenants shall be determined based on income and expense statements
   submitted by the cooperative housing associations.

   346.6. A cooperative housing association shall submit documentation
   establishing the existence of lifetime or long-term leases to low income and
   elderly tenants in order for such leases to be considered in assessing real
   property owned by the cooperative housing association.

   346.7. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer may conduct exterior and interior
   inspection of the property if in the Deputy Chief Financial Officer&#8217;s
   judgment an inspection is reasonably necessary in order to establish the
   assessed value of improved residential real property owned by a cooperative
   housing association.
