TAXATION OF MIXED USE PROPERTY (§ 9-327)

327.1. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall make every effort to afford
   affected taxpayers the opportunity to apply and qualify for mixed use status,
   but it shall be the affected taxpayer&#8217;s responsibility to inform the
   Deputy Chief Financial Officer of the existence of a mixed use property by
   properly completing and timely filing the mixed use form. The classes of
   property for tax purposes are set forth in D.C. Code § 47-813 and §9903 of
   this title.

   327.2. For the purposes of this chapter, an &#8220;affected taxpayer,&#8221;
   is an owner of real property in the District who is required to file a mixed
   use form in accordance with the provisions of this section.

   327.3. An application properly completed and timely filed in accordance with
   § 3(c) and § 3(d)(3) of the Residential Property Tax Relief Act of 1977, as
   amended, effective February 28, 1978 (D.C. Law 2-45; D.C. Code § 47-850 (1981
   Ed.)), shall be required for purposes of classifying real property as Class
   One Property and imposing the applicable rate of taxation on the property.

   327.4. If any mixed use form is not submitted (postmarked) to the Office on or
   before June 1st of the year in which such forms are mailed to affected
   taxpayers, or within the time extended by the Deputy Chief Financial Officer,
   or any mixed use form is timely submitted (postmarked) on or before June 1st,
   but is either inaccurate or incomplete and, after written notice from the
   Deputy Chief Financial Officer and, in the opinion of the Deputy Chief
   Financial Officer, remains inaccurate or incomplete, the Deputy Chief
   Financial Officer shall classify the affected taxpayer&#8217;s real property
   as Class Four Property for the next taxable year (July 1st-June 30st).

   327.5. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall notify affected taxpayers of
   Class Four Property status which results because of the application of §
   327.3 through the billing process or by any other method which is deemed
   appropriate.

   327.6. Whenever the mixed use form or information sought under the form, or
   records or documents sought to completely and accurately inform the Deputy
   Chief Financial Officer as to the mixed use of the property are not submitted
   in the time provided for by this chapter, and it is shown to the Deputy Chief
   Financial Officer&#8217;s satisfaction that the failure to provide the form,
   information, record, or document was due to reasonable cause and was not due
   to simple neglect, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall apportion the
   mixed uses of the property according to the best information available.

   327.7. In order to receive Class Three classification, the property in
   question shall be subject to the Hotel Occupancy Tax imposed under the
   provisions of D.C. Code §§ 47-3201 et seq.
