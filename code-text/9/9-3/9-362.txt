   362.4. For renovations, additions that are not new structures, and other
   additions, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer may consider the
   taxpayer&#8217;s submitted &#8220;Schedule of Costs&#8221; (FP 315) when
   determining the assessed value of the real property.

   362.5. In determining the assessed value of real property where there is
   construction in progress and sixty-five percent (65%) of the total estimated
   construction is determined to be complete, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer
   may consider the &#8220;Schedule of Costs&#8221; (FP 315).

   362.6. In considering the &#8220;Schedule of Costs,&#8221; the Deputy Chief
   Financial Officer shall rely primarily on the Percentage of Completion Guides
   in §§ 362.2 and 362.3.
