                                  DC REGULATIONS

SUBDIVISION OR COMBINATION OF LOTS (ยง 9-352)

352.1. The creation of tax lots shall not, in and of itself, result in a
   reclassification of the real property.
   
   
   
   Example: An individual owns one lot that is Class 5 unimproved. The owner
   requests the property be divided into two (2) tax lots for taxation purposes.
   Both lots will continue to be treated as Class 5 unimproved property. The
   owner may be able to obtain a reclassification if the owner can show, for
   instance, that the property has been subdivided into record lots under the
   zoning regulations such that the lots are no longer buildable lots and are
   therefore exempt from Class 5.

   352.2. If the Deputy Chief Financial Officer determines that a combination of
   lots results in the use of the property falling into more than one class, he
   or she shall apportion the property into the appropriate classes of real
   property.
   
   
   
   Example: An individual owns a commercial building that abuts an unimproved
   lot. The commercial building is Class 3 property and the unimproved lot is
   Class 5. If the owner combines the two (2) lots, and the unimproved portion of
   the new lot continues to meet the requirements for Class 5, the property will
   be treated as mixed use property, with the portion of the lot on which. the
   building is located placed in Class 3, and the remainder of the lot placed in
   Class 5.
