                                  DC REGULATIONS

COMPUTATION OF TAX (§ 9-3702)

3702.1. The amount of the federal credit shall be construed to take full
   advantage of the maximum state death tax credit allowable under the laws of
   the United States.

   3702.2. In determining the maximum amount of the allowable federal credit, it
   shall be presumed that the maximum allowable federal credit determined in
   accordance with §2011(b) of the Internal Revenue Code subject to the
   limitations of §§ 2011(e) and (f) was claimed and that all other
   requirements of § 2011 were satisfied. Failure to claim the maximum amount of
   the federal credit on the federal estate tax return shall not affect the
   amount of the District estate tax due.

   3702.3. For resident decedents owning no real or tangible personal property
   located outside the District, the District estate tax shall equal the federal
   credit (determined in accordance with the Act and §§ 3702.1 and 3702.2 of
   this chapter.
   
   
   
   Example: The decedent was domiciled in the District with all of the
   decedent&#8217;s property located in the District. The value of the
   decedent&#8217;s total gross estate is nine hundred twenty thousand dollars
   ($920,000) and the allowable deductions are one hundred seventy thousand
   dollars ($170,000). The allowable credit for state death taxes (&#8220;federal
   credit&#8217;) is twenty thousand and four hundred dollars ($20,400).
   Consequently, the District estate tax due is twenty thousand and four hundred
   dollars ($20,400).

   District estate tax due
   
   
   
   20,400

   3702.4. For resident decedents owning property located outside the District,
   the District estate tax shall equal the federal credit (determined in
   accordance with the Act and §§ 3702.1 and 3702.2) reduced by the lessor of
   one of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The amount of death tax paid to any other state that qualifies for the
   credit; or
   
   
   
   (b)	An amount computed under the following formula:
   
   
   
   Federal credit
   
   X
   
   Value of the gross estate subject to death tax in the other state (applying
   District law)
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The value of the decedent&#8217;s gross estate
   
   
   
   
   
   Example: The decedent resided in the District but owned a summer beach house
   in Maryland. The value of her gross estate is one million four hundred fifteen
   thousand dollars ($1,415,000) and the allowable deductions are four hundred
   fifteen thousand dollars ($415,000). The allowable credit for state death
   taxes (&#8220;federal credit&#8221;) is thirty-three thousand two hundred
   dollars ($ 33,200). The District estate tax will be thirty-three thousand two
   hundred dollars ($33,200) reduced by the lesser of the tax actually paid by
   the estate to Maryland or the amount allowed by statute. In this case, the
   thirty-three thousand two hundred dollars ($33,200) is reduced by the
   statutory amount of eleven thousand six hundred fourteen dollars ($11,614).
   The District estate tax is twenty-one thousand five hundred eighty-six dollars
   ($21,586).

   3702.5. The District estate tax shall be imposed on the estate of a
   nonresident decedent to the extent that the decedent&#8217;s property has a
   taxable situs in the District. The tax is computed under the following
   formula:
   
   
   
   Federal credit
   
   X
   
    Value of that part of decedent&#8217;s gross estate subject to tax by the
   District
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
    The value of the decedent&#8217;s gross estate
   
   
   
   
   
   Example: The decedent was domiciled in the State of Maryland and conducted
   business as a sole proprietor in the District of Columbia. The decedent gross
   estate totals three million four hundred thirty-five thousand dollars
   ($3,435,000) and allowable deductions total seven hundred thirty-five thousand
