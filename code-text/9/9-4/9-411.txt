TAXABLE SERVICES UNDER CONTRACT PRIOR TO JULY 1, 1989 (ยง 9-411)

411.1. Each vendor who sells tangible personal property or provides services
   pursuant to a lump sum contract entered into prior to July 1, 1989, in which
   the taxable sales of property or services are included in the price of the
   contract with nontaxable sales or services, may allocate the taxable and
   nontaxable values in the contract according to the market value of the
   services or property provided.

   411.2. This permission to allocate is not intended to limit the property or
   services subject to taxation; nor is it intended to authorize any expense
   deductions that may be part of the selling price of the property or services.
   This permission to allocate shall only apply to services that became subject
   to sales and use tax pursuant to the Revenue Amendment Act of 1989.

   411.3. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer may request copies of contracts and
   other documentation to support an allocation made pursuant to ยง 411.1.

   411.4. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer is authorized to disallow an
   allocation made under ยง 411.1, if it appears that the allocation does not
   fairly reflect the market value of the services or property provided.

   411.5. If a vendor does not submit documentation in response to a request by
   the Deputy Chief Financial Officer, or if the Deputy Chief Financial Officer
   determines the allocation to be improper, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer
   may presume the full value of the contract is subject to the sales tax.

   411.6. Service contracts entered into prior to July 1, 1989, and paid in full
   before July 1, 1989, shall not be subject to the tax.

   411.7. Contracts for services performed and completed prior to July 1, 1989,
   but billed according to the terms of the contract on or after July 1, 1989,
   shall not be subject to the tax.

   411.8. Service contracts entered into prior to July 1, 1989, where no services
   were performed before July 1, 1989, and where services were paid for when the
   contract was completed after July 1, 1989, shall be subject to the tax.

   411.9. Service contracts entered into prior to July 1, 1989, where services
   were performed both before and after July 1, 1989, and where services were
   paid for when the contract was completed after July 1, 1989, shall be subject
   to the tax on the entire charge.
