                                  DC REGULATIONS

BOOKBINDING AND RELATED SERVICES (ยง 9-435)

435.1. Bookbinding and finishing services rendered in connection with the
   printing of tangible personal property shall be considered an inseparable part
   of the fabrication or production of a finished article, and as such are
   subject to tax. However, if the intention of the purchaser is to resell the
   subject of these services, the purchaser is entitled to issue a resale
   certificate to the bookbinder and purchase the bookbinding and related
   services without paying the tax.

   435.2. Services performed by bookbinders on tangible personal property owned
   by the consumer, which is not a complete or finished article of tangible
   personal property prior to the rendition of any services by the bookbinder,
   are considered an integral part of the production or fabrication of tangible
   personal property, and as such, subject to the tax. These services include all
   steps in the process of bringing the property to its final completed form,
   such as collating, folding and stitching, padding and trimming, plastic
   binding, Acco fastening, tabbing, and paper ruling.

   435.3. Services which are taxable when performed in combination with or as a
   part of any printing of tangible personal property include folding,
   perforating, cornering, hole punching, scoring, and flat cutting.

   435.4. Folding, perforating, cornering, hole punching, scoring, and flat
   cutting are nontaxable services only when performed alone, or in combination
   only with each other. Separation of charges for these services on the bill to
   the customer (if the services are performed with a taxable function) does not
   make the charges non-taxable.
