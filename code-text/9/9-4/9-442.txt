FOOD OR DRINK PREPARED FOR IMMEDIATE CONSUMPTION (ยง 9-442)

442.1. In addition to the definition set forth in the Act [which is codified
   at D.C. Code ยง 47-2001(n)(1)(a)], the term &#8220;food or drink prepared for
   immediate consumption&#8221; includes sales made by a street or sidewalk
   vendor who has no fixed place of business, even though the vendor does not
   sell from a vehicle.

   442.2. For the purposes this section, the term &#8220;food or drink prepared
   for immediate consumption&#8221; does not include food or drink sold or
   intended to be sold by grocery stores, supermarkets, delicatessens, or other
   grocery-type food stores for home preparation or consumption.

   442.3. If a business combines the sale of food or drink for home preparation
   or consumption with the sale of food or drink for immediate consumption, those
   sales of food or drink for home preparation or consumption shall be exempt
   only when sold in the same form, quantities, and packaging as is commonly sold
   in grocery type food stores.

   442.4. The owner or operator of any hotel, inn, tourist camp, tourist cabin,
   boardinghouse, or any other place furnishing meals or food together with
   rooms, lodgings, or accommodations to the public shall segregate and charge
   separately the sale price of such meals or food from any other charges to
   their customers.
