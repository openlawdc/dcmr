                                  DC REGULATIONS

FABRICATION OR PRODUCTION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY (ยง 9-440)

440.1. The tax shall be charged on the full sales price for the production or
   fabrication of tangible personal property on special order, even if charges
   for labor are segregated from the cost of the materials.

   440.2. If a new item is being produced, the tax shall be collected on the full
   sales price. For example, if a manufacturer orders a repair part for machinery
   from a machine shop, the tax must be collected on the full sales price of the
   part, including labor.

   440.3. The tax applies to instances where materials are furnished by the
   customer and the fabrication of a new item consists of labor only. The
   following are examples of labor subject to the tax:
   
   
   
   (a)	A steel fabricator or machine shop rolling, bending, cutting, boring or
   punching holes in materials furnished by a customer;
   
   
   
   (b)	A tailor making a suit from materials furnished by a customer;
   
   
   
   (c)	Drapes or slipcovers made from materials furnished by a customer;
   
   
   
   (d)	Printing of tangible personal property from materials furnished by the
   customer.
