   consumption in maintaining, operating, and conducting the activities of the
   company which are subject to the gross receipts tax under An Act Making
   appropriations to provide for the expenses of the government of the District

   Add the results of all Step Two applicable sales and use tax rates. Remit to
   the District total Use tax payable to the District,&#8221; as computed in Step
   Two for all applicable tax rates.
   
   
   
   The following are examples of the application of § 471.3.
   
   
   
   (1)	The taxpayer has gross receipts charges from the sale of toll
   telecommunication service everywhere for the calendar month of one million
   dollars ($ 1,000,000), with one hundred thousand dollars ($ 100,000) of those
   gross charges and/or gross receipts in the District. Purchases of tangible
   personal property subject to use tax are five hundred thousand dollars ($
   500,000), with fifty thousand dollars ($ 50,000) in the District. For purposes
   of this example, a six percent (6%) District sales tax rate applies to forty
   thousand dollars ($ 40,000) of the fifty thousand ($ 50,000) in District
   purchases. The remaining ten thousand dollars ($ 10,000) in District purchases
   are subject to an eight percent (8%) rate. The use tax exemption, and use tax
   payable to the District, is computed as follows:
   
   
   
   Step One
   
   
   
   Column (1)
   
   
   
   Column (2)
   
   
   
   Column (3)
   
   
   
   Column (4)

   =
   
   $ 50,000 exemption
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   $ 1,000,000
   
   
   
   $ 50,000
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Step Two and Step Three
   
   
   
   These steps need not be completed because the exemption equals taxable
   purchases resulting in no District use tax payable. However, a tax return
   prescribed by the Mayor shall be filed in this instance, nonetheless.
   
   
   
   (2)	Same facts as (1) above except that gross receipts or gross charges
   subject to a District gross receipts tax or toll telecommunication service tax
   are fifty thousand dollars ($ 50,000). The exemption is computed as follows:

   payable to the District)

   471.4. A public-service company exempt from the sales tax under this section
   shall pay a use tax on all purchases subject to the sales tax under the act
   and subject to the compensating use tax under the District of Columbia Use Tax
   Act in an amount determined by applying the following three-step formula:

   Add the results of all Step Two applicable sales and use tax rates. Remit to

   in Step Two for all applicable tax rates.
   
   
   
   The following are examples of the application of § 471.4:
   
   
   
   (1)	The taxpayer has public-service miles traveled everywhere for the calendar
   month of one million miles (1,000,000), with one hundred thousand miles
   (100,000) traveled in the District. Purchases of tangible personal property
   subject to use tax are five hundred thousand dollars ($ 500,000), with fifty
   thousand dollars 50,000) in the District. For purposes of this example, a six
   percent (6%) District sales tax rate applies to forty thousand dollars ($
   40,000) of the fifty thousand dollars ($ 50,000) in District purchases. The
   remaining ten thousand dollars ($ 10,000) in. District purchases are subject
   to an eight percent (8%) rate. The use tax exemption, and use tax payable to
   the District, is computed as follows:
   
   
   
   Step One
   
   
   
   Column (1)

   and the tax paid by the twentieth (20th) day of the month following the
   calendar month for which the tax is due.

   471.4 shall include rental payments subject to sales and use taxes under the
   act and the District of Columbia Use Tax Act without regard for any exemption
   from these taxes.

   derived from operation of the formulas in §§ 471.3 and 471.4.

   taxpayer may petition for, or the Mayor may require, the employment of any
   other method to effectuate an equitable allocation of the taxpayer&#8217;s
   sales tax exemption.
