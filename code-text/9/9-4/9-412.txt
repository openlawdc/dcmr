COLLECTION OF SALES TAX BY VENDORS (ยง 9-412)

412.1. The reimbursement for the tax to be collected by the vendor from the
   purchaser shall be stated separately from the sales price of the property sold
   or services rendered.

   412.2. In the case of a vendor not engaged in business in the District who
   makes sales at retail and who has been expressly authorized to pay the tax
   imposed by this title, that vendor shall, at the time of making such sales,
   collect reimbursement for the tax from the purchaser and give to the purchaser
   a receipt which shows separately the sales price of the property sold or
   service rendered and the reimbursement for the tax.

   412.3. If a vendor collects reimbursement for the tax from the purchaser in
   excess of the amounts prescribed in ยง 413, or if the vendor collects
   reimbursement for the tax on any exempt or non-taxable sale or charge, the
   vendor shall make a refund or credit to the purchaser for the amount of the
   overcharge.

   412.4. To the extent that each overcharge has not been refunded or credited to
   the purchaser, it shall be paid to the District in the same manner and at the
   same time as the tax required to be paid by the provisions of the Act (D.C.
   Code ยง 47-2016).

   412.5. The gross receipts from any sales covered by ยง 414 shall be excluded
   from the total gross receipts of the seller making such sales and the seller
   shall neither collect nor add any reimbursement for tax to the consideration
   charged for such retail sales.
