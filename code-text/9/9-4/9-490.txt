   490.3. Any sale of or charge for the service of procuring, offering or

   seeker shall be subject to the tax if the service is performed in the
   District.
   
   
   
   Example: An employment agency provides employment counseling to Customer C at
   its office located in the District. The service is performed in the District
   and the charge for the service shall be subject to the tax.

   490.4. The sales and use tax shall be imposed on the total amount of any sale
   of or charge for the service of procuring, offering, or attempting to procure
   in the District a job seeker for an employer or employment for a job seeker.
   
   
   
   Example: An employment agency administers an employment test for customer C.
   The employment agency bills Customer C twenty-five dollars ($ 25) for
   administering the employment test. At the time the employment agency bills
   Customer C for the employment test, the employment agency shall also bill for
   the sales tax on the twenty-five dollars ($ 25) charge for the employment
   test. The employment agency shall then remit the tax to the Deputy Chief
   Financial Officer in accordance with §§ 412 and 413 of this chapter and §§
   135 and 136 of the Sales Tax Act, approved May 27, 1949 (63 Stat. 118; D.C.
   Code §§ 47-2015 and 47-2016).

   490.5. The vendor shall separately state on the bill the charge for any
   service performed in the District and indicate the amount of sales tax on the
   charge.
   
   
   
   Example: An employment agency provides employment counseling, and employment
   advice and administers an employment test for Customer C. The counseling and
   advice are provided at the employment agency’s office Located in the
   District. The employment test is administered at the employment agency’s
   office located in Pennsylvania. The employment agency bills Customer C
   seventy-five dollars ($ 75) for all services: (1) twenty-five dollars ($ 25)
   for the counseling; (2) Twenty-five dollars ($ 25) for the advice; and (3)
   twenty-five dollars ($ 25) for the testing. The administration of the
   employment test was performed outside of the District and shall not be subject
   to the tax. However, the employment agency shall separately state on the bill
   the charge for the counseling and advice performed in the District and
   indicate the amount of the sales tax on those charges. At the time the
   employment agency bills for the counseling and advice, it shall also bill for
   the sales tax on the fifty dollars ($ 50) charge for the services performed in
   the District. The employment agency shall then remit the sales tax to the
   Deputy Chief Financial Officer in accordance with §§ 412 and 413 of this
   chapter and §§ 135 and 136 of the Sales Tax Act, approved May 27, 1949 (63
   Stat. 118; D.C. Code §§ 47-2015 and 47-2016).

   490.6. Failure to separately state the charges for any taxable service
   performed in the District shall result in the taxation of the total charge for
   all services provided by the vendor which include any services subject to the
   tax pursuant to § 490.1.
   
   
   
   Example: A vendor provides employment counseling for a customer at its office
   located in the District and administers an employment test at its office
   located in Virginia. The vendor bills the customer sixty dollars ($ 60) for
   the services of providing the employment counseling and administering the
   test. Twenty dollars ($ 20) represents the fee for the employment counseling
   and forty dollars ($ 40) represents the fee for administering the employment
   testing. The bill only shows the total sixty dollars ($ 60) charge for the
   counseling and testing services. Although only the charge for the employment
   counseling would be subject to the tax under this section, the tax shall be
   imposed on the total sixty dollars ($ 60) charge since the bill does not
   separately state the fee for the taxable service.

   490.7. Any vendor, as defined in § 493.5 of this chapter, that performs in
   the District the service of procuring, offering or attempting to procure in
   the District a job seeker for an employer or employment for a job seeker shall

   the typing test, the employment agency shall also bill for the sales tax on
   the twenty dollars ($ 20) charge for the typing test. The employment agency
   shall remit the tax to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer in accordance with
   §§ 412 and 413 of this chapter and §§ 135 and 136 of the Sales Tax Act,
   approved May 27, 1949 (63 Stat. 118; D.C. Code §§ 47-2015 and 47-2016).
