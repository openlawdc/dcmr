   have a license for the full three (3) months preceding the month in which a

   his or her payment in place of collecting and remitting sales tax based upon
   the number of months, or fraction of a month, in the three (3) preceding
   months the individual held his or her license.
   
   
   
   Example 1: An individual is granted a Class A license on December 15, 1993.
   The next payment is due January 20, 1994. The individual had a license for one
   (1) of the three (3) months preceding a month in which a payment is due.
   Consequently, the individual shall pay one third (1/3) of the quarterly

   twenty-five dollars ($ 125) ($ 375÷3).
   
   
   
   Example 2: An individual who has a Class A license decides to terminate his or
   her license on January 21, 1994. The individual had a license for a fraction
   of one (1) month preceding the next month in which a payment was to be made
   (April 20, 1994). Consequently, the individual shall pay one-third (1/3) of
   the quarterly payment in place of collecting and remitting sales tax, one
   hundred and twenty-five dollars ($ 125) ($ 375÷3).

   478.11. A corporation that remits sales tax on sales made by certain street
   vendors shall not collect and remit sales tax on sales made by street vendors
   after September 30, 1993, but shall collect and remit sales tax on its other

   making all payments in place of collecting and remitting sales tax.
   
   
   
   Example: A restaurant located in the District of Columbia employs a street
   vendor to sell its hot dogs from a cart on a District sidewalk. The restaurant
   is not required to report the sales of hot dogs from the cart after September
   30, 1993, but is still required to report taxable sales made at its restaurant
   location.

   478.12. Every payment in place of collecting and remitting sales tax shall be
   made in cash or by cashier&#8217;s check, certified check or money order.

   478.13. A street vendor may continue to purchase tangible personal property
   for resale exempt from District sales tax by completing a District of Columbia
   Certificate of Resale and presenting it to the seller at the time of purchase.

   478.14. After September 30, 1993, a street vendor shall not be required to
   file a cash bond or prepayment with surety with the Deputy Chief Financial
   Officer.

   478.15. After September 30, 1993, a street vendor who has filed a bond or
   prepayment with surety with the Deputy Chief Financial Officer for any period
   of time may file for a refund of his or her vendor bond or release of his or
   her prepayment with surety by filing with the Deputy Chief Financial Officer a
   Claim for Refund Form (FR-331). A street vendor seeking a refund of a bond
   shall attach to his or her Claim for Refund Form an original cashier&#8217;s
   receipt that indicates the amount of the bond and the date the bond was paid.

   478.16. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall review all requests for
   refunds of cash bonds or releases of prepayments with surety made pursuant to
   § 478.15 of this chapter. If the Deputy Chief Financial Officer determines
   that the street vendor is in compliance with all District tax laws, the Deputy
   Chief Financial Officer shall refund the street vendor&#8217;s cash bond plus
   accrued interest or release the street vendor&#8217;s prepayment with surety.

   478.17. In accordance with D.C. Code § 47-3310(c)(2), as amended, the Deputy
   Chief Financial Officer shall pay six percent (6%) per annum interest on the
   amount of a street vendor&#8217;s cash bond from the date the vendor filed the
   bond with the Deputy Chief Financial Officer until the date of refund, except,
   no interest shall accrue after December 31, 1993, and no more than six (6)
   years of interest in total shall accrue.

   478.18. If a street vendor fails to make a payment in place of collecting and
   remitting sales tax on or before the payment date, any amount of unpaid
   payment shall be assessed and collected as unpaid sales tax.

   478.19. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer may impose interest on an unpaid
   payment in place of collecting and remitting sales tax or unpaid portion of a
   payment in place of collecting and remitting sales tax at the rate of one and
   five tenths percent (1.5%) per month, or fraction of a month, from the
   prescribed payment due date until the full payment is made.

   478.20. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer may impose a penalty on an unpaid
   payment in place of collecting and remitting sales tax or unpaid portion of a
   payment in place of collecting and remitting sales tax at the rate of five
   percent (5%) per month, or fraction of a month, from the prescribed payment
   due date until the full payment is made. The total amount of penalty may not
   exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of the unpaid payment.

   478.21. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall not issue a
   &#8220;Certificate of Good Standing&#8221; to a street vendor who fails to do
   the following:

   and pay any associated interest and penalties; and
