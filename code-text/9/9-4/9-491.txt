                                  DC REGULATIONS

SALES AND USE TAXES IMPOSED ON THE SALE OF OR CHARGE FOR PLACING A JOB SEEKER
WITH AN EMPLOYER IN THE DISTRICT (§ 9-491)

491.1. The sale of or charge for placing a job seeker with an employer in the
   District which is provided after May 31, 1994, shall be subject to the sales
   and use taxes imposed in accordance with § 125 of the District of Columbia
   Sales Tax Act and § 212 of the District of Columbia Use Tax Act, approved May
   27, 1949 (63 Stat. 115 and 126; D.C. Code §§ 47-2002 and 47-2202).

   491.2. The sales and use tax shall be imposed on the total amount of the sale
   of or charge for placing a job seeker with an employer in the District.
   
   
   
   Example: A vendor located in Virginia seeks and locates a secretarial position
   in the District for a customer. The vendor places the customer in the
   secretarial position in the District. The placement of the customer occurs in
   the District and the fee charged for the placement of the customer in the
   secretarial position in the District shall be subject to the tax.

   491.3. The vendor, as defined in § 493.5 of this chapter, shall separately
   state on the bill the charge for any placement in the District and indicate
   the amount of sales tax on the charge.
   
   
   
   Example: An employment agency located in Wisconsin provides Customer C:
   employment testing, employment counseling and employment advice and places
   Customer C in a position located in the District. The testing, counseling, and
   advice are provided at the employment agency&#8217;s office located in
   Wisconsin. Customer C is placed with an employer in the District. The
   employment agency bills Customer C two hundred dollars ($ 200) for all
   services: (1) twenty-five dollars ($ 25) for the testing; (2) twenty-five
   dollars ($ 25) for the counseling; (3) twenty-five dollars ($ 25) for the
   advice; and (4) one hundred twenty-five dollars ($ 125) for the placement fee.
   The employment agency shall separately state on the bill the charge for the
   placement in the District and indicate the sales tax amount on that charge. At
   the time the employment agency bills for the one hundred twenty-five dollars
   ($ 125) charged for the placement, it shall also bill for the sales tax on the
   one hundred twenty-five dollars ($ 125) charge for the placement. The sales
   tax shall be remitted to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer in accordance with
   §§ 412 and 413 of this chapter and §§ 135 and 136 of the Sales Tax Act,
   approved May 27, 1949 (63 Stat. 118; D.C. Code §§ 47-2015 and 47-2016).

   491.4. Failure to separately state the charges for any service subject to the
   tax pursuant to § 491.1 of this chapter shall result in the taxation of the
   total charge for all services provided by the vendor which include any
   services subject to the tax pursuant to § 491.1.
   
   
   
   Example: An employment agency administers an employment test to a customer at
   its office located in Virginia. Later the agency searches for and locates in
   the District a management position for the customer. The customer is placed in
   the management position in the District and the employment agency bills the
   customer three hundred seventy-five dollars ($ 375) for the services provided
   in the District. Seventy five dollars ($ 75) represents the fee for
   administering the employment test and three hundred dollars ($ 300) represents
   the fee for the placement. The bill only shows the total three hundred
   seventy-five dollars ($ 375) fee for all services rendered. Although only the
   charge for the placement fee would be subject to the tax, the tax shall be
   imposed on the total three hundred seventy-five dollars ($ 375) fee for the
   employment testing and placement since the bill does not separately state the
   charge for the taxable service.

   491.5. Any vendor, as defined in § 493.5 of this chapter, engaged in business
   in the District shall collect and remit to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer
   the sales tax on any sale of or charge for the placement of a job seeker with
   an employer in the District.

   491.6. Any purchaser that pays for the service of placing a job seeker with an
   employer in the District for which the sales tax was not collected and
   remitted to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall be subject to the use tax
   and shall remit the tax in accordance with § 215 of the Use Tax Act, approved
   May 27, 1949 (63 Stat. 127; D.C. Code § 47-2205).
   
   
   
   Example A: An employment agency located in Texas places a job seeker also
   located in Texas with its client employer located in the District. The
   employment agency bills the client employer two hundred dollars ($ 200) for
   the placement. The placement occurred in the District and shall be subject to
   the sales tax. If at the time the employment agency bills the client employer
   for the two hundred dollars ($ 200) placement charge, the employment agency
   fails to bill for the sales tax on the two hundred dollars ($ 200) charge, the
   client employer shall become liable for the use tax and shall remit the tax to
   the Deputy Chief Financial Officer.
   
   
   
   Example B: An employment agency located in Virginia places its client job
   seeker also located in Virginia with an employer located in the District. The
   employment agency bills the client job seeker two hundred dollars ($ 200) for
   the placement. The placement occurs in the District and shall be subject to
   the tax. If at the time the employment agency bills the client job seeker for
   the two hundred dollars ($ 200) placement charge the employment agency fails
   to bill for the sales tax on the charge, the client job seeker shall become
   liable for the use tax and shall remit the tax to the Deputy Chief Financial
   Officer.

   491.7. Any sale of or charge for a placement of a job seeker with an employer
   located outside of the District shall not be subject to the tax.
   
   
   
   Example: All employment agency located in the District places a job seeker
   also located in the District with its client employer located in Virginia. The
   placement occurs outside of the District and shall not be subject to the tax.
