CERTIFICATES OF EXEMPTION (§ 9-417)

417.1. The Act presumes that all receipts from the sale of tangible personal
   property or services subject to sales and use tax are from taxable sales at
   retail and are subject to the tax. The contrary shall be established by the
   vendor or purchaser.

   417.2. If the purchaser is the United States, the District of Columbia, or any

   and date of the sale.

   417.3. A semipublic institution purchasing property at retail for its own
   maintenance and operation must obtain from the Deputy Chief Financial Officer

   exemption. If the semipublic institution does not present the certificate of
   exemption to the vendor, the vendor must collect the reimbursement for the
   tax.

   417.4. If a vendor makes sales to a semipublic institution, the vendor must
   keep a record of the number of the certificate of exemption, the name of the
   purchaser, the date of each sale, and the amount of the sale.

   417.5. If a purchaser of tangible personal property is a member of a foreign
   diplomatic corps and personally presents an identification card issued to that
   purchaser by the State Department, exempting the person from excise taxes, the
   card shall be authority for the vendor not to add reimbursement for the sales
   tax to the sales price of the property; Provided, that the vendor must show on
   the record of each sale the name of the purchaser, the date of sale, the
   amount of the sale, and the State Department identification card number.

   417.6. In order to comply with the provisions of § 128(c) of the Act, as
   amended by the District of Columbia Tax Enforcement Act of 1982 (D.C. Law

   effective date of D.C. Law 4-131 shall be required to reapply for exemption.

   417.7. Exemption certificates issued under the Act and regulations prior to
   the effective date of D.C. Law 4-131 shall not be accepted for sales made
   after December 31, 1982.

   417.8. The tax shall be collected on sales to entities claiming exempt status
   on or after January 1, 1983 unless the vendor is presented with an exemption
   certificate issued under § 128(c) of the Act, as amended, and this chapter.

   417.9. The requirement in the Act that activities be carried on to a
   substantial extent within the District refers to location, operation
   (solicitation of funds) and administrative functions within the District.

   417.10. The following activities shall be considered to determine whether an
   institution is dispensing substantial benefits within the District:

   the District;
   
   
   
   (b)	Expenditures within the District in connection with scientific and
   research studies, conferences, seminars, and similar activities if such
   activities result in identifiable benefits to District residents; or
   
   (c)	Expenditures for payroll, rent, services, and supplies incurred in the
   District in order to provide the benefits for which the institution was
   formed; Provided, that such expenditures shall be considered only if it can

   or businesses. Expenditures (such as payments for social functions, lobbying)
   not incurred to produce benefits shall not be considered.

   and expenditures incurred everywhere the institution conducts its activities:
   
   
   
   (a)	Five percent (5%), if the institution is national in scope (activities
   extend to a majority of the States); or
   
   
   
   (b)	Twenty-five percent (25%), if the institution is not national in scope
   (activities extend to less than a majority of the States).

   417.12. The location requirement of § 128(c) of the Act is not satisfied by a
