                                  DC REGULATIONS

GAS, OIL, SOLID FUEL, AND STEAM (§ 9-444)

444.1. Sales of natural or artificial gas, oil, electricity, solid fuel or
   steam are exempt from the payment of sales tax, except as provided in this
   section.

   444.2. The sales tax applies to the receipts from the sale of natural or
   artificial gas, oil, electricity, solid fuel or steam when made to any
   purchaser for purposes other than resale or for use in manufacturing,
   assembling, processing or refining.

   444.3. Sales for resale include only such sales when made to persons
   registered under § 146 of the Act and only then if that person gives the
   vendor a certificate of resale.

   444.4. Receipts from the sale of natural or artificial gas, oil, electricity,
   solid fuel or steam consumed directly in manufacturing, assembling,
   processing, or refining (e.g., for operating machinery, lighting, and heating
   the factory or shop) are exempt from the tax.
   
   
   
   The following are examples of manufacturing, assembling, processing and
   refining:
   
   
   
   (a)	Manufacturing-production of ice or fabrication of ornamental iron
   railings, furniture, awnings;
   
   
   
   (b)	Assembly-assembly of radios, electric signs, truck bodies;
   
   
   
   (c)	Processing-cooking in a cannery or restaurant, pasteurizing milk; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Refining-production of gasoline or fuel oil in an oil refinery.

   444.5. The use of natural or artificial gas, oil, electricity, solid fuel or
   steam incidental to but closely connected with production, such as lighting
   drafting rooms where products are designed, operating a first-aid room, and
   plant air conditioning, are considered as used in manufacturing, assembling,
   processing, or refining and are not subject to tax.

   444.6. Natural or artificial gas, oil, electricity, solid fuel, or steam are
   subject to tax if consumed in administrative or commercial phases of the
   business activities listed in § 444.5, such as general offices, plant
   cafeterias (other than processing food), sales and display rooms, retail
   outlets, garages where trucks for off-premises sales of products are stored
   and serviced, and similar uses.

   444.7. The tax shall not apply to the receipts from any of the types of sales
   exempted under D.C. Code § 47-2005.

   444.8. If electricity or gas shall be sold through a meter for a single use,
   or if oil, solid fuel, or steam shall be consumed in a single unit for a
   single use, the use determines the taxable status.

   444.9. If electricity or gas is sold through a single meter for two (2) or
   more uses, or if oil, solid fuel, or steam is consumed in a single unit for
   two (2) or more uses, some of which would be subject to the tax and some of
   which would not (such as a manufacturing plant and a retail store supplied
   through one meter or heated by one unit), the larger portion of the use of the
   service supplied through that meter or consumed in that unit shall determine
   the taxability of the service. The larger portion of use shall be measured by
   the relative load for each use or the relative time of operation of each.

   444.10. Except as otherwise provided in this section, each purchaser of
   natural or artificial gas, oil, electricity, solid fuel, or steam for any
   purpose claimed to be exempt from or not subject to the tax, in order to
   qualify for the exemption, must present evidence satisfactory to the Deputy
   Chief Financial Officer that the sale is exempt under the Act and this
   section, and must obtain from the Deputy Chief Financial Officer a specific
   exemption to be presented to the vendor.

   444.11. After an exemption is presented to a vendor, that vendor shall be
   relieved from the further collection of reimbursement for the tax until the
   exemption is canceled by the purchaser, or is revoked by the Deputy Chief
   Financial Officer by notice given to both the purchaser and the vendor.

   444.12. Vendors of natural or artificial gas, oil, electricity, solid fuel, or
   steam in the District are relieved from the collection of the reimbursement of
   the tax on sales to the United States through its Executive Departments and to
   the District of Columbia through its Purchasing Officers, where such purchaser
   of such natural or artificial gas, oil, electricity, solid fuel, or steam,
   claims to be an instrumentality of either the United States or the District of
   Columbia and, therefore, exempt from reimbursing the vendor for the tax. The
   vendor shall keep a record of sales to these government instrumentalities in
   the same manner and to the same extent as required in the case of semipublic
   institutions.

   	EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: While it may appear that the sales tax regulations in 9
   DCMR § 444, conflict with the statutory provisions in both Supp. V of the
   1973, D.C. Code (1978) [Title 47, §§ 2601(14)(a)(4); 2601(14)(a)(7);
   2605(1): and 2701(a)(2)]; and the analogous sections of the 1981 Edition of
   the D.C. Code, [Title 47, §§ 2001(n)(1)(-); 2005(11); and 2201(a)(1)(-)],
   this is due to an error in the codification of the D.C, Code, not an error in
   this DCMR title. The statutory requirement for the application of the sales
   and use taxes to natural and artificial gas, oil, electricity. solid fuel, and
   steam was imposed in §§ 114(a)(4) and § 201(a)(2) of the original D.C.
   Sales Tax Act (P.L. 81-76, 5-27-49). Those provisions were repealed and the §
   128 exemption added by §§ 301 and 302 of D.C, Law 1-23 (&#8220;Revenue Act
   of 1975&#8243;). The changes were reflected in both the 1978 Supp. V and 1981
   Ed. of the D.C. Code However, the changes made by D.C. Law 1-23 (the repeal of
   the sales tax on these items) were later repealed by §§ 401-407 of D.C. Law
   1-70, the &#8220;Revenue Act of 1976.&#8221; The restoration of the original
   provisions was not properly codified by the Congressional staff then
   responsible for the D.C. Code. The errors were not corrected in the 1981
   Edition of the D.C. Code, but will be corrected in the 1982 Supplement.
