                                  DC REGULATIONS

MULTISTATE TAX CREDIT (§ 9-4101)

4101.1. To prevent actual multi-state taxation of the sale of toll
   telecommunication service under the Act, the taxpayer, upon proof that it paid
   a properly due excise, sales, use, or gross receipts tax in another
   jurisdiction on a sale that is subject to taxation under this section, shall
   be allowed a credit for the amount paid against the tax, but in no event shall
   the credit permitted exceed the tax imposed on the sale under the Act.
   
   
   
   Example: The taxpayer is able to show that excise and sales tax is required to
   be paid and has been remitted to four (4) states on gross charges subject to
   the tax imposed under this section as shown in Columns (1) through (5). A
   computation of the maximum allowable credit in this example is shown in Column
   (6).

   4101.2. A taxpayer may be allowed an alternate method for reporting the credit
   upon showing to the satisfaction of the Mayor that it does not have the
   capability through reasonable measures to determine the credit in the manner
   provided in this section.

   4101.3. The showing shall be made by a petition to the Mayor which includes
   the following information:
   
   
   
   (a)	The factual basis for the inability to determine the credit through
   reasonable measures in accordance with this section; and
   
   
   
   (b)	An alternate method of reporting the credit that the taxpayer believes is
   reasonable and equitable.

   4101.4. Until such time as a separate line for reporting the credit appears on
   the monthly return, the credit shall be subtracted from the “Total Tax
   Due” line on the return, and the net amount shall be entered on the line
   designated “Total Amount Due” together with any late charges due as
   computed on net tax.

   4101.5. The taxpayer shall indicate that a credit has been subtracted by
   writing or typing the words “credit claimed” on the line designated
   “Total Tax Due.”
