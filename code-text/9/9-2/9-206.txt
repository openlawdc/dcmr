SUSPENSION OF VALUATION AND IMPOSITION OF TAX (ยง 9-206)

206.1. Under the following circumstances, final valuation of an estate and
   final imposition of tax shall be suspended until such time as, in the opinion
   of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer, sufficient facts are available for
   proper determination of the tax:
   
   
   
   (a)	If part of the decedents estate consists of an interest in an estate which
   has not been settled;
   
   
   
   (b)	If the right to take under a will is in litigation;
   
   
   
   (c)	If the determination of tax based on the return of the beneficiary is
   contingent upon certain information to be disclosed in the return of the
   personal representative;
   
   
   
   (d)	If the value of the decedent&#8217;s interest in a partnership cannot be
   determined at the time of death; or
   
   
   
   (e)	If the determination of the existence, nature, or value of the property or
   interest subject to tax depends upon the outcome of litigation; the happening
   of an event which has not occurred; or the determination of a fact
   undetermined at the time of decedent&#8217;s death.

   206.2. If, in the opinion of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer, circumstances
   other than those listed in ยง 206.1 are such that the tax should be suspended,
   the Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall authorize suspension; Provided, that
   in all cases, the imposition of the tax shall be suspended only with respect
   to that portion of the property which in the opinion of the Deputy Chief
   Financial Officer cannot be properly assessed.

   206.3. If the nature of the property or the interest subject to the tax cannot
   be more certainly ascertained by postponing the valuation, the imposition of
   the tax shall not be postponed.
