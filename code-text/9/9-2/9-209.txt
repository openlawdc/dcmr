   Real estate and tangible personal property situated in the District
   
   $ 50,000.00;
   
   
   
   Assets in the State in which decedent was domiciled
   
   250,000.00
   
   
   
   Total estate
   
   $ 300,000.00
   
   
   
   The federal estate tax, under the 1926 Federal Revenue Act

   The maximum credit of 80% of this tax against which the estate may apply
   inheritance, estate, and succession taxes
   
   3,600.00
   
   
   
   Assume that the estate paid inheritance taxes of $ 300 to the District and
   inheritance taxes of $ 500 in another jurisdiction

   Balance of 80% credit ($ 3,600 โข $ 800)
   
   2,800.00
   
   
   
   One-sixth (ratio of real estate and tangible personal property in the District
   of the total estate) of $ 2,800 is the estate tax assessable by the District
