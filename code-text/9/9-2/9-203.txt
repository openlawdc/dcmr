                                  DC REGULATIONS

TAXABILITY OF FUTURE INTERESTS (ยง 9-203)

203.1. If the donee for life or years has the right, in his or her sole
   discretion, to expend or consume the corpus, or a part of the corpus, for the
   donee&#8217;s own use, the taxable value of the interest of the donee for life
   or years in that corpus, or that part of the corpus, shall be the value of the
   entire corpus or of that part of the corpus as may be so expended or consumed
   without reference to the method of determining the value of the life interest
   or of an estate for years as provided in ยง 202, except insofar as the market
   value of that part of the corpus as may be expended or consumed may be
   computed with reference to a fixed and definite standard, stated in the
   instrument creating the corpus, for the expenditure or consumption.

   203.2. If the corpus may be expended or consumed in whole or in part by any
   person or persons for the benefit of, or on behalf of, a donee for life or
   years (whether or not the donee for life or years shall personally have the
   right of invasion or use), the taxable value of the interest of the donee for
   life or years in that corpus shall be the value of the entire corpus (or of
   that part of the corpus as may be so expended or consumed) without reference
   to the method of determining the value of a life interest or of an estate for
   years as provided in ยง 202, except insofar as the market value of that part
   of the corpus as may be expended or consumed may be computed with reference to
   a fixed and definite standard, stated in the instrument creating the corpus,
   for the expenditure or consumption.

   203.3. To the extent which the corpus may be expended or consumed as set forth
   in this section, the future interest in the corpus shall be presumed to have
   no market value, unless, concurrently with the filing of the tax returns
   required to be filed for assessment purposes (for tax upon the interest of the
   donee for life or years and upon the future interest in the corpus), there is
   filed with the Deputy Chief Financial Officer tangible evidence relating to
   the age, life expectancy, state of health, accustomed scale of living,
   economic circumstances, and other sources of income of the donee for life or
   years.

   203.4. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer may, in his or her discretion,
   require additional evidence prior to assessment for the purpose of determining
   the market value referred to in this section.
