VALUATION (§ 9-202)

202.1. The taxable value of any estate for years shall be determined by
   multiplying five percent (5%) of the market value of the property from which
   the estate accrues by the figure shown in the table in § 202.3 opposite the
   number of years for which the estate is fixed.

   202.2. The taxable value of a fixed annuity shall be determined by multiplying
   the aggregate fixed sum or sums to be received each year by the figure shown
   in the table in § 202.3 opposite the fixed number of years during which the
   annuity is to run.

   202.4. The taxable value of life interest in any property shall be determined
   by multiplying five percent (5%) of the market value of the property (as of
   date of death of decedent) from which the life interest is to accrue, by the
   figure shown opposite the age of the beneficiary in the American Experience
   Table of Mortality in § 202.6.

   202.5. The taxable value of an annuity for life shall be multiplied by the
   appropriate figure in the same table, instead of five percent (5%) of the
   value of the property from which the annuity accrues. If payments under an
   annuity are to be made more often than once each year, the aggregate of those
   payments per year shall be considered the annuity payment for purposes of
   determining the taxable value.

   202.7. The age of the beneficiary to be used is the age on the birthday of the
   beneficiary nearest the date of the death of the decedent.

   202.8. In determining the value of any estate for life limited upon a
   precedent estate for life or a term of years, the value of the precedent life
   interest or a term of years shall be deducted, except where the time for
   payment of the tax is postponed under the provisions of § 7 of Article 1 of
   the Act.

   202.9. Where an estate for life, or for years, can be divested by the act or
   omission of any legatee or devisee, it shall be taxed as if there were no
   possibility of such divesting.

   202.10. In determining the value of the share or interest of a beneficiary in
   any estate where the beneficiary is presently in possession or enjoyment of
   the share or interest, no allowance shall be made on account of any contingent
   encumbrance nor for any contingency upon the happening of which the estate of
   property or some part of it or interest in it might be abridged, defeated, or
   diminished.

   202.11. Income accrued but not collected at the time of the death of the
   decedent is subject to the tax and is to be included in the valuation of the
   property.
