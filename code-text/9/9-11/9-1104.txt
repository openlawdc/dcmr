                                  DC REGULATIONS

TAX CREDITS TO QHTCS[COLON] RETRAINING COSTS FOR QUALIFIED DISADVANTAGED
EMPLOYEES (§ 9-1104)

1104.1. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, a QHTC shall be
   allowed a credit against taxes imposed by D.C. Official Code § 47-1817.6 for
   expenditures paid or incurred by a QHTC during the taxable year for retraining
   of a qualified disadvantaged employee.

   1104.2. The following expenditures for retraining qualified disadvantaged
   employees paid by a QHTC are eligible for the tax credit:
   
   
   
   (a)	Tuition, costs, or fees for credit or noncredit courses leading to
   academic degrees or certification of professional, technical, or
   administrative skills taken at District-based accredited colleges or
   universities;
   
   
   
   (b)	The cost for formal enrollment in training programs offered by nonprofit
   training providers (including community or faith-based organizations certified
   for the provision of training, or job-readiness preparation at skill levels
   suitable for immediate performance of entry-level jobs) that are pre-
   qualified for participation under this section by the Department of Employment
   Services and are in demand among technology companies in general, and among
   information and telecommunications companies in particular;
   
   
   
   (c)	Eligible training programs, other than those at District-based accredited
   colleges or universities, that are pre-qualified for participation under this
   section by the Department of Employment Services; and
   
   
   
   (d)	Worker retraining programs undertaken through an apprenticeship agreement
   approved by the District of Columbia Apprenticeship Council.

   1104.3. The credit claimed under this section shall be limited to twenty
   thousand dollars ($20,000) for each qualified disadvantaged employee during
   the first 18 months of employment.

   1104.4. If the amount of the credit allowable under this section exceeds the
   tax otherwise due from a QHTC, the unused amount of the credit shall not be
   carried forward after the tenth year following the first year the taxpayer
   files a return claiming QHTC status. In the alternative, the QHTC can elect to
   take a refundable credit in an amount up to fifty percent (50%) of the unused
   credit with no carryover of the unused credit to subsequent years. A QHTC,
   that is not a corporation, may file a claim for refund.

   1104.5. The retraining costs shall be prorated for the number of months of the
   training program.

   1104.6. The following are examples of the application of §§ 1104.1 through
   1104.5:
   
   
   
   (a)	Company E, a QHTC, hires 10 qualified employees to work in activities
   described in D.C. Official Code § 47 -1817.1(5)(A)(iii). Five of Company
   E&#8217;s employees are qualified disadvantaged employees within the meaning
   of § 1199. None of the qualified disadvantaged employees are affected by the
   restrictions of § 1199. On January 1, 2001, Company E enters into a 24- month
   program that was pre-qualified by the Department of Employment Services to
   retrain five qualified disadvantaged employees. The cost for the 24-month
   program is $20,000 for each qualified disadvantaged employee.
   
   
   
   In tax year 2001, Company E is entitled to a tax credit of $50,000 and a tax
   credit of $25,000 in tax year 2002, computed as follows: Company E&#8217;s
   retraining costs were $833 per employee per month ($833 per month x 5
   employees x 12 months = $50,000 and $833 per month x 5 employees x 6 months =
   $25,000).
   
   
   
   The credit limitation of § 1104.3 is $1,111 per employee per month in
   retraining costs, for a period not to exceed eighteen months, paid by a QHTC
   to retrain each qualified disadvantaged employee.
   
   
   
   (b)	Assume the same facts as in example 1, except the retraining cost for the
   24- month program is $60,000 per qualified disadvantage employee. Company E is
   entitled to a tax credit in tax year 2001 of $66,667 and a tax credit of
   $33,333 in tax year 2002, even though Company E&#8217;s retraining costs are
   $2,500 per employee per month. § 1104.3 limits the credit to $1,111 per
   employee per month in retraining costs, for a period not to exceed eighteen
   months ($1,111 x 5 x 12 = $66,667 and $1,111 x 5 x 6m = $33,333).
