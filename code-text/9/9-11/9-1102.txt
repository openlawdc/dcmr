1102.1. A QHTC shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by D.C.
   Official Code § 47-1817.6 for each dollar reimbursed to or paid on behalf of
   each qualified employee for relocation costs. The credit shall not exceed:
   
   
   
   (a)	$5,000.00 for each employee who relocates his or her employment to the
   District from a location outside the District but does not relocate his or her
   principal residence into the District. The annual credit shall not exceed $
   250,000.00; or
   
   
   
   (b)	$7,500.00 for each employee who relocates his or her employment to the
   District from a location outside the District and also relocates his or her
   principal residence into the District. The annual credit shall not exceed $
   1,000,000.00.
   
   
   
   (c)	For purposes of this subsection, the principal residence shall be
   determined as of the last day of the first six months of employment in the
   District by a QHTC.
   
   
   
   (d)	This $ 5000 (or $7500) credit can be allocated over 2 years if the
   relocation costs are incurred in 2 separate tax years.

   1102.2. The tax credit for employment relocation costs shall not be allowed:
   
   
   
   (a)	Until the QHTC relocates at least 2 qualified employees from employment
   outside the District to inside the District;
   
   
   
   (b)	Until the QHTC employs the qualified employee for at least 6 months in the
   District in an activity described in D.C. Official Code §
   47-1817.1(5)(A)(iii);
   
   
   
   (c)	If the qualified employee works less than 35 hours per week;
   
   
   
   (d)	If the qualified employee is a Key Employee; or
   
   
   
   (e)	If the QHTC claims a deduction for the relocation costs.

   1102.3. If the amount of the credit allowable under this section exceeds the
   tax otherwise due from a QHTC, the unused amount of the credit shall not be
   carried forward after the tenth year following the first year the taxpayer
   files a return claiming employment relocation costs under section 1102.1.

   1102.4. Costs qualify as relocation costs if the following conditions are met:
   
   
   
   (a)	The commencement date of the qualified employee&#8217;s move or financial
   assistance must be after December 31, 2000;
   
   
   
   (b)	The cost is the only relocation cost requested for the qualified employee;
   and
   
   
   
   (c)	Deductible expenses do not exceed the limits set forth in this section.
   
   
   
   (d)	The following are examples of the application of §§ 1102.1 to 1102.4:
   
   
   
   (1)	Company C, a QHTC, employs 10 people in activities described in D.C.
   Official Code § 47-1817.1(5)(A)(iii). On January 2, 2001, Company C hires
   employees X and Y, who are both qualified full time employees, to work at
   Company C&#8217;s place of business in the District in an activity described
   in D.C. Official Code § 47-1817.1(5)(A)(iii). Both employee X and employee Y
   previously were employed outside the District. Employees X and Y are not Key
   Employees within the meaning of § 1199. Both employees, X and Y purchase
   residences outside the District. Company C reimburses employees X and Y for
   their moving expense of $10,000 and the cost of financing the purchase of
   their new residences of $15,000. Company C does not plan to take a deduction
   for the relocation costs paid employees X and Y. After employees X and Y are
   employed by Company C for 6 months, Company C is entitled to a tax credit of $
   10,000.
   
   
   
   (2)	Assume the same facts as in example 1, except employee X purchased his
   residence in the District within six months of employment in the District.
   Company C is entitled to a tax credit of $7,500 for employee X and $5,000.00
   for employee Y.
