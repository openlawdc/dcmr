                                  DC REGULATIONS

TAX CREDITS TO QHTCS[COLON] WAGES PAID TO QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES (§ 9-1103)

1103.1. A QHTC shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by D.C.
   Official Code § 47-1817.6 equal to ten percent (10%) of the wages paid during
   the first 24 calendar months to a qualified employee who is employed in the
   District by the QHTC in any of the activities defined in D.C. Official Code §
   47-1817.1(5)(A)(iii) and hired after December 31, 2000.

   1103.2. The credit shall not exceed, for each qualified employee, five
   thousand dollars ($5,000) in a taxable year.

   1103.3. The credit shall not be allowed if:
   
   
   
   (a)	The employee is a key employee;
   
   
   
   (b)	The QHTC accords the qualified employee lesser benefits or rights than it
   accords other employees in similar jobs; or
   
   
   
   (c)	The qualified employee is employed as the result of:
   
   
   
   (1)	The displacement of another employee;
   
   
   
   (2)	A strike or lockout;
   
   
   
   (3)	A layoff in which other employees are awaiting recall; or
   
   
   
   (4)	A reduction of the regular wages, benefits, or rights of others in similar
   jobs.

   1103.4. If the amount of the credit allowable under this section exceeds the
   tax otherwise due from a QHTC, the unused amount of the credit shall not be
   carried forward after the tenth year following the first year the taxpayer
   files a return claiming QHTC status.

   1103.5. The following are examples of the application of §§ 1103.1 to
   1103.4:
   
   
   
   (a)	On January 1, 2001, Company D, a QHTC, hires 10 employees at an annual
   salary of $40,000 each. Since the workers perform the activities described in
   D.C. Official Code § 47 -1817.1(5)(A)(iii); they are classified as qualified
   employees. None of the qualified employees are affected by the restrictions of
   § 1103.3. The annual payroll each year for the 10 qualified employees is
   $400,000. For tax years 2001 and 2002, Company D is entitled to a tax credit
   equal to 10% of the annual salaries of $400,000 received by the 10 qualified
   employees, or $40,000.
   
   
   
   (b)	Assume the same facts as in example 1, except the annual payroll for each
   year is $600,000. For tax years 2001 and 2002, Company D is entitled to a tax
   credit of only $5,000.00 for each qualified worker, or $50,000, since the
   limitation of § 1103.2 would apply.
   
   
   
   (c)	Assume the same facts as in example 1, except 5 of the qualified employees
   are entry level and are paid $30,000 each and 5 of the qualified employees are
   highly skilled and are paid $70,000 each. For tax years 2001 and 2002, the
   limitation of § 1103.1 applies to the 5-entry level qualified employees and
   the limitation of § 1103.2 applies to the highly skilled qualified employees.
   Therefore, Company D is entitled to a tax credit of $40,000, calculated as
   follows: (1) the total annual wages paid to the entry level qualified
   employees is $150,000 of which 10%, or $15,000, is available for the credit,
   (2) the total annual wages paid to the highly skilled qualified employees is
   $350,000 and since the credit for each of the five highly skilled qualified
   employee exceeds $5,000, only $25,000 is available for the credit, (3) $15,000
   plus $25,000 totals $40,000.
