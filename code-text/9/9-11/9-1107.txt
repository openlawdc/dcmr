1107.1. In the case of a QHTC there shall be allowed a deduction from gross
   income in computing net income equal to:
   
   
   
   (a)	An amount that is the lesser of forty thousand dollars ($40,000) or the
   actual cost of property for tangible personal property described in Internal
   Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC) § 179(d)(1) and including leasehold
   improvements;
   
   
   
   (b)	If the QHTC is a tenant, the cost of any real property and leasehold
   improvements regardless of whether or not such improvements become an integral
   part of the realty; such improvements shall include improvements described in
   9 DCMR §§ 702.3, 702.4, and 702.5; or
   
   
   
   (c)	The amount claimed on the QHTC&#8217;s corresponding federal income tax
   return should be considered as part of the amount allowed under IRC §

   1107.2. The following are examples of the application of §1107.1:
   
   
   
   (a)	On January 1, 2001, Company F, a QHTC, purchases computers at a cost of
   $100,000. The computers are used by Company F to conduct qualified high
   technology activities. In filing their Federal income tax return, Company F
   claims the maximum deduction of $20,000 of the cost of the computers. In
   filing their District franchise tax return, Company F is allowed up to an
   additional $20,000 of the cost of the computers, for a maximum deduction for
   D.C. tax purposes of $40,000.
   
   
   
   (b)	Same facts as in Example 1, except Company F does not claim the maximum
   deduction for Federal tax purposes but claims $10,000.00. In filing their
   District franchise tax return, Company F is allowed to deduct up to an
   additional $30,000 of the cost of the computers, for a maximum deduction for
   D.C. tax purposes of $40,000.
