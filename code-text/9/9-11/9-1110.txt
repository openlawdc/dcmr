                                  DC REGULATIONS

ROLLOVER OF CAPITAL GAIN FROM QUALIFIED STOCK TO OTHER QUALIFIED STOCK (§
9-1110)

1110.1. In the event of a sale of qualified stock held by a taxpayer other
   than a corporation for more than 6 months and with respect to which the
   taxpayer elects the application of this section, gain from the sale shall be
   recognized to the extent the amount realized on the sale exceeds the cost of
   qualified stock purchased by the taxpayer during the sixty (60) day period
   beginning on the date of the sale, reduced by the amount of the gain, not to
   exceed such cost, previously deferred under this section.

   1110.2. A taxpayer shall be treated as having purchased qualified stock if,
   but for the purposes of §§ 1110.3 and 1110.4, the adjusted basis of the
   property in the hands of the taxpayer would be its cost.

   1110.3. If gain from a sale is not recognized under § 1110.1, the
   unrecognized gain shall reduce the basis of qualified stock, in the order
   acquired, which is purchased by the taxpayer during the sixty (60) day period
   described in § 1110.1.

   1110.4. For purposes of determining whether the non-recognition of gain under
   § 1110.1 applies to qualified stock which is sold:
   
   
   
   (a)	The taxpayer&#8217;s holding period for the stock and the stock referred
   to in this section shall be determined without regards to IRC § 1223; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Only the first 6 months of the taxpayer&#8217;s holding period for the
   stock referred to in this section shall be taken into account for purposes of
   applying IRC § 1202(c)(2).

   1110.5. This section shall not apply to any gain that is treated as ordinary
   income under the IRC.

   1110.6. The following is an example of the application of §§ 1110.1 through
   1110.5:
   
   
   
   G, an individual taxpayer, purchased qualified stock in QHTC X on January 1,
   2001 for $7,000. On July 1, 2001, G sells all her stock in Company X for
   $10,000. On August 1, 2001, G purchases qualified stock in QHTC Y for $5,000.
   The stock of Company X and Company Y is qualified small business stock as
   defined by IRC §1202. G elects to apply this section, and the effect is
   computed in the following manner:
   
   
   
   01/01/01 Purchase qualified stock in Company X
   
   Adjusted Basis
   
   $7,000.00
   
   
   
   07/01/01 Sold Company X stock
   
   Amount Realized
   
   $10,000.00

   $3,000.00
   
   
   
   Amount realized on sale (line 2)
   
   
   
   $10,000.00
   
   
   
   Less qualified stock in Company Y purchased within 60 days of sale
   
   
   
   ($5,000.00)
   
   
   
   Less Amount of Gain (line 3)
   
   
   
   ($3,000.00)
   
   
   
   Amount of Gain recognized
   
   
   
   $2,000.00
   
   
   
   Amount of Gain not recognized (line 3 minus line 7)
   
   
   
   $1,000.00
   
   
   
   Basis in Company Y&#8217;s stock (line 5 minus line 8)
   
   
   
   $4,000.00
