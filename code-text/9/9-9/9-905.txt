DETERMINATION OF TAX (§ 9-905)

905.1. In the absence of records showing the number of miles actually operated
   per gallon of motor fuel, it shall be conclusively presumed that the average
   mileage so operated by the bus in all operations, within or without the
   District, during the tax period, was four (4) miles per gallon.

   905.2. If a report required to be filed under the Act is not filed, or if a

   be obtainable. Written notice of the determination shall be mailed to the
   taxpayer by registered mail or by certified mail.

   905.3. A determination under § 905.2 shall finally and irrevocably fix the

   mailing date of the notice of the determination; or unless the Deputy Chief
   Financial Officer, on his or her own motion, redetermines the amount.

   905.4. After a hearing or redetermination, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer
   shall give notice of the final determination to the person against whom the
