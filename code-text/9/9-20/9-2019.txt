                                  DC REGULATIONS

APPEAL REHEARINGS (§ 9-2019)

2019.1. Within fifteen (15) days after the date on which the Commission
   transmits the Panel’s decision, the petitioner or OTR, by written notice
   served on the Chairperson and the opposing party, may request a rehearing.

   2019.2. The Commission may, in its discretion, either agree to rehear the
   appeal or reject the request to rehear the appeal. If a rehearing is granted,
   the Commission shall mail or email its decision to grant a rehearing and the
   date of the proposed rehearing to the Office of Tax and Revenue and to the
   Petitioner(s). The non-requesting part shall have ten (10) days from the date
   of the rehearing notice to serve its response to the rehearing notice on the
   Commission and the requesting party.

   2019.3. A rehearing shall be granted as a matter of right, upon request, if a
   decision is based on evidence outside the record.

   2019.4. A rehearing shall be granted as a matter of right if the decision of
   an appeal changes the proposed assessed value of a real property, excluding
   single-family residential real property, by at least twenty percent (20%) or
   ten million dollars ($10,000,000), whichever is less.

   2019.5. In the case of a rehearing, a three (3)-Commissioner Panel shall be
   convened, consisting of the Chairperson, the Vice-Chairperson, and a
   Commissioner who was a member of the Panel that heard the underlying appeal.

   2019.6. A rehearing shall not be a hearing de novo but instead shall be
   considered a continuation of the original hearing before the Commission.

   2019.7. No Panel decision shall be changed upon rehearing except upon a
   finding of plain error.  The burden of proof shall be upon the moving party to
   demonstrate plain error.
