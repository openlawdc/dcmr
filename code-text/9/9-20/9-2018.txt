APPEAL DECISIONS AND NOTICES OF DECISIONS (§ 9-2018)

2018.1. Each appeal decision shall be based upon consideration of the entire
   record described in § 2020 of this chapter or such lesser portion of the
   record as may be agreed upon by the petitioner and the Deputy Chief Financial
   Officer, and approved by the Panel.

   2018.2. Each valuation decision shall include the Panel’s determination of
   the estimated market value of the real property for the applicable tax year.

   2018.3. The Panel shall raise or lower the proposed assessment of any real
   property for which a petition has been properly filed that it finds to be more
   than five percent (5%) above or below the estimated market value of that
   property, except in the case of plain error.  In the case of plain error, the
   assessment shall be clerically corrected.

   2018.4. A Panel shall not order an increase of the assessed value of any
   parcel of real property above its estimated market value or a decrease of the
   assessed value of any parcel of real property below its estimated market value
   solely on the basis of average ratio studies comparing sales and assessments,
   unless the studies are the primary basis for the assessment or reassessment of
   the concerned real property in question.

   2018.5. A Panel decision shall include an allocation of total assessed value
   between the improvements, if any, and the land.

   2018.6. In arriving at its determination, the Panel shall consider the
   evidence in light of generally accepted principles of valuation and shall take
   into consideration principles of equalization of assessments of the same or
   substantially similar properties.

   2018.7. The Panel shall accept any stipulation entered into by the petitioner
   and OTR which has been forwarded to the Commission and which disposes of an
   appeal, if the Panel is satisfied that the stipulation was agreed to knowingly
   and voluntarily by both parties.

   2018.8. Every decision by the Panel shall contain a detailed written statement
   of the basis for the decision.

   2018.9. Every decision by a Panel shall be signed by each member who
   participated in the decision and shall indicate whether each participating
   member agreed with or dissented from the decision.

   2018.10. In the case of an appeal of an annual proposed assessment, a Panel
   shall render its decision and notify the petitioner and OTR within thirty (30)
   days in the case of a residential real property appeal and eighty (80) days in
   the case of a commercial real property appeal.

   2018.11. A written notice of each decision, along with the decision itself,
   shall be sent to each party by first class mail or electronic mail within five
   (5) business days after the decision is issued.

   “The petitioner has the right to appeal an adverse decision of the
   Commission to the Tax Division of the Superior Court of the District of
   Columbia.  Payment of all real property taxes, together with interest and
   penalties (if applicable), before the filing of a petition in the Tax Division
   of the Superior Court, is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the appeal.”

   2018.13. Every decision of the Commission shall be maintained by the
