PETITIONER&#8217;S REBUTTAL (§ 9-2010)

2010.1. A petitioner may submit a rebuttal to any new evidence submitted by
   OTR in its response to the appeal (and any supplement thereto) that was not
   previously raised during the administrative review, and the Panel may request
   additional information it considers necessary, so long as the rebuttal is
   submitted in writing to OTR and to the Commission at least three (3) business
   days before the scheduled hearing. OTR may submit a response to the
   petitioner’s rebuttal at the hearing.

   2010.2. Notwithstanding the requirements in § 2010.1, the Commission may,
   upon a showing of good cause by the Petitioner as to why the requirements of
   § 2010.1 could not be met, allow rebuttal evidence to be submitted and may
   allow the record to remain open for a specified period of time to allow a
   response from OTR.
