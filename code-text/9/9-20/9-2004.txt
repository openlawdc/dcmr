2004.1. A Commissioner shall not review an appeal involving real property with
   which he or she has had any direct or indirect financial dealings in the two
   (2)-year period prior to the date of the filing date of the appeal, including

   any hearing, discussion, vote, or appeal referred to in § 2004.1.

   2004.3. The Chairperson may appoint a Commissioner to substitute for a member
   of a Panel who has recused himself or herself pursuant to § 2004.2.
