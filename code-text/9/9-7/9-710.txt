PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES SUBJECT TO THE
TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICE TAX (§ 9-710)

710.1. For the personal property tax year beginning July 1, 1990, and ending
   June 30, 1991 (tax year 1991), and for each succeeding year, each
   telecommunication company shall be allowed a credit against personal property
   tax for the least of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The amount of personal property tax due on equipment defined in § 710.7;
   
   
   
   (b)	The amount of toll telecommunication service tax paid for the twelve (12)
   months immediately preceding the personal property tax year; or
   
   
   
   (c)	The amount of personal property tax reported on equipment defined in §
   710.7 multiplied by the following fraction:
   
   
   
   Step One
   
   Column (1)
   
   
   
   Column (2)
   
   
   
   Column (3)
   
   
   
   Column (4)
   
   
   
   Current personal property tax due on property defined in § 710.7 before any
   Column (4) credit
   
   X
   
   Gross charges on toll telecommunication service tax is paid for twelve
   preceding months
   
   X
   
   Value of personal property everywhere as defined in § 710.7 on July 1st of
   Column (1) tax year
   
   X
   
   Credit against Column (1) tax not to exceed the limits of this section
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Gross charges and/or gross receipts everywhere from property defined in §
   710.7 for twelve months preceding Column (1) tax year: Less resales defined in
   § 710.9
   
   
   
   Value of personal property on which Column (1) tax due is computed
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The following are examples of the application of § 710.1 during the 1991
   personal property tax year ending June 30, 1991:
   
   
   
   (1)	The taxpayer has § 710.7 property in the District valued at one hundred
   thousand dollars ($ 100,000), property everywhere valued at one million
   dollars ($ 1,000,000) on July 1, 1990. The amount of Column (1) tax due is
   three thousand one hundred dollars ($ 3,100). No § 4101.1 credit for tax paid
   to another jurisdiction is involved. The taxpayer&#8217;s gross receipts
   everywhere from § 710.6 property for the twelve (12) month period which ended
   June 30, 1990, are twelve million dollars ($ 12,000,000). The gross charges on
   which toll telecommunication service tax was paid for this same period are one
   million dollars ($ 1,000,000), and the toll telecommunication service tax paid
   for this same period was sixty-seven thousand dollars ($ 67,000). In this
   instance, the amount of the credit allowed on the 1991 personal property tax
   return is two thousand five hundred eight-three dollars ($ 2,583), the least
   of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The Column (1) tax of three thousand one hundred dollars ($ 3,100);
   
   
   
   (b)	The toll telecommunication service tax paid; or
   
   
   
   (c)	The result of the following computation, which is two thousand five
   hundred eighty-three dollars ($ 2,583):
   
   
   
   (1)
   
   
   
   
   
   (2)
   
   
   
   
   
   (3)
   
   
   
   
   
   (4)
   
   
   
   
   
   $ 3,100
   
   X
   
   $ 1,000,000
   
   X
   
   $ 1,000,000
   
   =
   
   $ 2,583 exemption
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   $ 12,000,000
   
   
   
   $ 100,000
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   (2)	Same facts as example (1) except that gross charges subject to the toll
   telecommunication service tax were one million four hundred thousand dollars
   ($ 1,400,000). In this instance, the allowable credit is three thousand one
   hundred dollars ($ 3,100), the amount of personal property tax reported in
   Column (1).
   
   
   
   (1)
   
   
   
   
   
   (2)
   
   
   
   
   
   (3)
   
   
   
   
   
   (4)
   
   
   
   
   
   $ 3,100
   
   X
   
   $ 1,400,000
   
   X
   
   $ 1,000,000
   
   =
   
   $ 3,617 exemption
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   $ 12,000,000
   
   
   
   $ 100,000

   710.2. For the personal property tax year beginning July 1, 1989, and ending
   June 30, 1990 (tax year 1990), the provisions of § 710.1 shall apply except
   that the Column (2) numerator shall be gross receipts on which the gross
   receipts tax was paid under the Gross Receipts Tax Amendment Act of 1987 for
   the period beginning July 1, 1988, and ending February 28, 1989, added to
   gross charges for the period beginning March 1, 1989, and ending June 30,
   1989.

   710.3. For the personal property tax year beginning July 1, 1988, and ending
   June 30, 1989 (tax year 1989), the following procedure shall be applied, in
   some instances retroactively:
   
   
   
   (a)	Step One:
   
   
   
   Section 710.1 provisions are applied except that the Column (2) numerator
   shall be gross receipts on which the gross receipts tax paid was under the
   Gross Receipts Tax Amendment Act of 1987, for the period beginning July 1,
   1987, and ending February 28, 1988, added to gross charges for the period
   beginning March 1, 1988, and ending June 30, 1988. Any resulting credit is
   multiplied by one-third (1/3);
   
   
   
   (b)	Step Two:
   
   
   
   Section 709.1 credit provisions shall be applied to the period beginning July
   1, 1987, and ending June 30, 1988. Any resulting credit is multiplied by
   two-third (2/3); and
   
   
   
   (c)	Step Three:
   
   
   
   The final result in Step One is added to the final result of Step Two to
   determine the total credit allowed against personal property tax reported on
   the taxpayer&#8217;s 1989 return.

   710.4. An amended 1989 personal property tax return shall be filed if the
   application of this section results in additional tax due thereon.

   710.5. If the allocation provisions of this section do not fairly represent
   the extent of the personal property tax exemption, the taxpayer may petition
   for, or the Mayor may require, the employment of any other method to
   effectuate an equitable allocation of the taxpayer&#8217;s personal property
   tax exemption.
   
   
   
   The following is an example of the application of § 710.5:
   
   
   
   Before March 1, 1989, a taxpayer may have paid the District gross receipts tax
   on none or on only some of its gross receipts; had no gross receipts; or, had
   gross receipts for only some of the twelve (12) months preceding the personal
   property tax year at issue. In such an instance, the taxpayer may petition the
   Mayor to modify § 710.1, 710.2 or 710.3 credit provisions, for example, by
   employing in the Column (2) numerator and denominator gross receipts or gross
   charges from the twelve (12) months concurrent with the personal property tax
   year rather than the preceding twelve (12) months. In this example, the
   taxpayer may file an amended personal property tax return after that tax year
   has ended to claim refund of any credit determined by operation of the
   modified formula described in the previous sentence.

   710.6. As used in § 710, the term &#8220;value of personal property&#8221;
   shall mean, for both the numerator and denominator of the fraction, that
   amount carried on the taxpayer&#8217;s balance sheet at original cost for the
   personal property shown in the fraction.

   710.7. For purposes of this section, &#8220;toll telecommunication service
   property&#8221; shall be limited to equipment, used wholly or in part in the
   transmission or reception of any sound, vision, or speech communication
   subject to the tax imposed by the &#8220;Toll Telecommunication Service Tax
   Emergency Act of 1989,&#8221; and shall include, but not be limited to, the
   following equipment used in transmissions or receptions:
   
   
   
   (a)	Switches;
   
   
   
   (b)	Transmitters;
   
   
   
   (c)	Receivers;
   
   
   
   (d)	Telephones; and
   
   
   
   (e)	Fiber optics cable and equipment.

   710.8. Section 710.1 gross charges as defined in the Act shown in the Column
   (2) numerator shall not include amounts on which a multistate tax credit is
   allowed.

   710.9. Section 710.1 gross charges as defined in the Act shown in the Column
   (2) denominator may be reduced by gross charges from the sale of toll
   telecommunication service for resale to any other telecommunication company
   subject to the tax under the Act.
