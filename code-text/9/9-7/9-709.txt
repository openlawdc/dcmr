   The following are examples of the application of § 709.1:
   
   
   
   (1)	The taxpayer has property valued at one hundred thousand dollars ($
   100,000) subject to District personal property tax, and personal property
   everywhere of one million dollars ($ 1,000,000) on July 1, 1988. The amount of
   personal property tax due is three thousand one hundred dollars ($ 3,100). The
   corporation&#8217;s total gross receipts everywhere for the twelve (12) month
   period which ended June 30, 1988, are twelve million dollars ($ 12,000,000),
   and receipts on which District gross receipts taxes were paid are one million
   dollars ($ 1,000,000) for this tax year. District gross receipts taxes paid
   are sixty-seven thousand dollars ($ 67,000). In this instance, the amount of
   the credit allowed on the tax year 1989 property tax return is two thousand
   five hundred eighty-three dollars ($ 2,583), the least of one the following:

   X
   
   $ 1,000,000
   
   X
   
   $ 1,000,000
   
   =
   
   $ 2,583 exemption
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   $ 12,000,000

   (2)	Same facts as example (1) except that receipts subject to District gross
   receipts tax were one million four hundred thousand dollars ($ 1,400,000). In
   this instance, the allowable credit is three thousand one hundred dollars ($
   3,100), the amount of personal property tax payable to the District.

   (3)
   
   
   
   
   
   (4)
   
   
   
   
   
   $ 3,100
   
   X
   
   $ 1,400,000
   
   X
   
   $ 1,000,000
   
   =
   
   $ 3,617 exemption
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   $ 12,000,000
   
   
   
   $ 100,000

   709.2. If the allocation provisions of this section do not fairly represent
   the extent of the personal property tax exemption, the taxpayer may petition
   for, or the Mayor may require, the employment of any other method to
   effectuate an equitable allocation of the taxpayer&#8217;s personal property
   tax exemption.

   709.3. As used in § 709.1, the term &#8220;value of personal property&#8221;
   shall mean, for both the numerator and denominator of the fraction, that
   amount carried on the taxpayer&#8217;s balance sheet at original cost for the
   personal property shown in the fraction.

   709.4. The numerator and denominator of Column (3) property values shall
   include property subject to the personal property tax under the provisions of
   the Personal Property Tax Amendment Act of 1986, effective February 28, 1987
   (D.C. Law 6-212; D.C. Code § 47-1521 et seq.) without regard for any
   exemption from the tax.
