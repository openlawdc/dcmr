   her interest to another person without notice to the holder, the address of
   the owner of record controls.

   3004.3. With respect to reports of unclaimed property under § 106 of the Act,
   if determinable, the value of the property shall be reported as of the date of

   (a)	The amount of interest that has actually accrued as of the date of the
   report; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The amount of interest that is estimated will be accrued as of the date of
   delivery.

   3004.4. In general, each report shall contain the information required by §
   117 of the Act (D.C. Code § 42-217), and §§ 3004.14 and 3004.15 of this
   chapter. Reports that do not contain all required information shall be subject

   3004.5. Insurance companies shall provide the full name of the insured or
   annuitant and the beneficiary, and the last known address of each.

   3004.6. Requests for additional information by the Deputy Chief Financial
   Officer to the holder shall be in writing and shall state the justification
   for the request for additional information.

   3004.7. If service charges have been deducted, a holder shall include or
   attach as part of the report the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The citation to the authority or copy of the form of contract authorizing
   the service charge(s);
   
   
   
   (b)	The value or amount of each item of property before any service charge(s)
   were deducted; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The amount of service charge(s) deducted from each item and the date(s) on
   which the service charge(s) were deducted.

   3004.8. If the amount of service charge equals or exceeds the value of an
   item, this fact shall be reported in accordance with § 3002.9.

   3004.9. For the purposes of the Act and this chapter, the term &#8220;service
   charge&#8221; includes any deduction by a holder from property presumed
   abandoned under the Act, including any deductions made by the holder prior to
   the presumption of abandonment which are made by reason of the inactivity,
   dormancy, or unclaimed status of the property.

   3004.10. Any interest or dividend accrued on property subject to the Act shall
   be included as part of the value of the property.

   deposits, dividend bearing share accounts, and other interest-bearing policies
   or accounts until the period of the year the policies or accounts are required
   to be reported under the Act.

   3004.12. If payment of interest or dividends on property presumed abandoned
   under the Act was discontinued before or after the property was presumed
   abandoned by reason of the inactivity, dormancy, or unclaimed status of the
   property, the holder shall include or attach as part of the report filed under
   the Act, the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	A copy of the form of contract which authorized the discontinuance of
   payment of interest or dividends;
   
   
   
   (b)	The citation to the authority for the discontinuances of payment of
   interest or dividends.

   3004.13. Any holder of unclaimed property may voluntarily report funds before
   the statutory due dates and be relieved of all responsibility and
   accountability upon delivery of the unclaimed property.

   3004.14. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 3004.2, where the District has a
