                                  DC REGULATIONS

TAX COMPUTATIONS FOR UNINCORPORATED BUSINESSES (§ 9-119)

119.1. As in the case of corporations, the phrase &#8220;taxable income&#8221;
   of unincorporated business means the amount of net income derived from sources
   within the District within the meaning of Title 10 of the Act, and shall be
   determined in accordance with Title 10 of the Act and § 122 of this chapter;
   except as otherwise provided in § 119.6.

   119.2. Under the Act, the net income of an unincorporated business is computed
   in practically the same manner as the net income of a corporation.
   Accordingly, an unincorporated business is generally entitled to allowable
   deductions from gross income to the same extent that would be allowable if the
   business were incorporated.

   119.3. The Act is drawn so that only income taxed against an unincorporated
   business is not again taxed to the owner or owners of the business as
   individuals.

   119.4. No deduction which is allowed or allowable from the gross income of an
   unincorporated business subject to the tax imposed by Title 8 of the Act shall
   be allowed as a deduction in the individual return of any person entitled to
   share in the net income of the business.

   119.5. Taxes, contributions, and other deductions of the individual owners of
   a business which are not applicable to the income of the business are not
   deductible in the unincorporated business tax return, but may be deducted in
   the individual returns of the proprietors, partners, or other persons entitled
   to share in the net income.

   119.6. Any amount exempted from the tax imposed by Title 8 shall be reported
   and included in the gross income of the person(s) entitled to share in the
   exemption. If there is more than one (1) taxpayer entitled to share the amount
   excluded, the amount excluded by each shall be the same proportion as the
   amount of net income apportioned to that taxpayer for federal income tax
   purposes. That amount shall be reported in the return of each District
   resident individual for his or her taxable year in which the taxable year of
   the business ended.

   119.7. The full amount of the exemption allowed by law shall be deductible
   from the net income from District sources of an unincorporated business
   (reporting for a full year) whether the entire income of the business is
   wholly or partly derived from sources within the District.
