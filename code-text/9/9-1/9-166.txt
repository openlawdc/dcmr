COMBINED REPORTING[COLON] TAX CREDITS (ยง 9-166)

166.1. Current year tax credits.  A tax credit generated by a member of a
   combined group is an attribute of the member rather than of the combined
   group, and credits are to be computed for each taxpayer separately. 
   Therefore, a tax credit earned by a member of the combined group that is not
   fully used by or allowed to that member shall not be used in either whole or
   in part by any other member of the combined group or applied in whole or in
   part against the total income of the combined group.

   166.2. Tax credit carryforward.  A tax credit carryforward of a member of a
   combined group that was derived from a credit generated by the member either
   during a year in which the member was subject to combined reporting, or a
   prior year when the member was not subject to combined reporting, shall not be
   used in either whole or in part by any other member of the combined group or
   applied in whole or in part against the total income of the combined group.
