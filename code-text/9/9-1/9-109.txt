                                  DC REGULATIONS

CONSOLIDATED TAX RETURNS (§ 9-109)

109.1. District of Columbia affiliated group means an &#8220;affiliated
   group&#8221; as defined in § 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
   amended (IRC). Generally, District of Columbia affiliated groups shall not
   include any corporation that does not have gross income derived from sources
   within the District and nexus to the District of Columbia. Members of an
   affiliated group that are exempt from District taxation cannot be included in
   the consolidated return.
   
   
   
   (a)	District of Columbia affiliated group may not include any corporation,
   which is a Qualified High Technology Company as defined in D.C. Official Code
   § 47-1817.01(5)(A) (a QHTC) and those corporations, described in IRC §
   1504(b). A QHTC may opt out of status under D.C. Official Code §
   47-1817.01(5)(A) and be eligible to be included in a District of Columbia
   affiliated group. See § 109.40.
   
   
   
   (b)	If a Qualified High Technology Company that has not made an election under
   § 109.40 ceases to be a Qualified High Technology Company, such corporation
   (and any successor of such corporation) may not be certified as a Qualified
   High Technology Company before the 61st month beginning after its first
   taxable year in which it ceased to be a Qualified High Technology Company.
   During this period, such corporation is not eligible to make an election under
   § 109.40.
   
   
   
   (c)	Each member of a District of Columbia affiliated group shall be jointly
   and severally liable for the taxes, interest and penalties of the District of
   Columbia affiliated group. If a corporation is a member of the District of
   Columbia affiliated group for a part of the year, then the corporation shall
   be liable for the tax liability attributed to that portion of the year that
   the corporation was a member of the District of Columbia affiliated group.
   
   
   
   (d)	The &#8220;gross income derived from sources within the District&#8221;
   requirement in D.C. Official Code § 47-1805.02(5)(D) is waived for a
   corporation that meets the following requirements:
   
   
   
   (1)	A member of a regulated industry whose revenue is determined by means of a
   rate-setting procedure by a federal government agency, but only where the
   regulatory requirements to which the industry is subject impose restrictions
   on the structure of the affiliated group,
   
   
   
   (2)	A member of an affiliated group as defined in § 1502 of the IRC, and
   
   
   
   (3)	In a trade or business in the District.

   109.2. All members of a District of Columbia affiliated group must use the
   same accounting method and the same accounting period.
   
   
   
   (a)	Unless otherwise provided by these rules or inconsistent with the
   provisions of the D.C. Official Code, the consolidated taxable income for a
   District of Columbia consolidated return year shall be determined in the same
   manner and under the same procedures, including intercompany adjustments and
   eliminations, as are required by the federal consolidated return regulations.
   
   
   
   (b)	All intercompany transactions between and among members of a District of
   Columbia affiliated group will be eliminated in determining the District of
   Columbia apportionment factors.
   
   
   
   (c)	An intercompany transaction is a transaction between corporations that are
   members of the same District of Columbia affiliated group immediately before
   and after the transaction.
   
   
   
   (d)	Any deferred gain, loss or deduction from a prior transaction with a
   member of a District of Columbia affiliated group shall be recognized for
   District of Columbia purposes when the member subsequently ceases to be a
   member of that District of Columbia affiliated group or when the asset
   involved is transferred to a corporation which is not a member of District of
   Columbia affiliated group.
   
   
   
   (e)	All supplementary and supporting schedules filed with a District of
   Columbia consolidated return shall be prepared in columnar form. One column
   being provided for each corporation included in the consolidated return, with
   the parent corporation information reported in the first column. Supporting
   schedules for the consolidated return shall also include a column for totals
   of like items before adjustments are made, a column for intercompany
   eliminations and adjustments, and a column for totals of like items after
   giving effect to the eliminations and adjustments.

   109.3. Each member of a District of Columbia affiliated group must have gross
   income in any amount derived from sources within the District of Columbia.
   
   
   
   (a)	In the case of a corporation that is a member of the District of Columbia
   affiliated group for a part of the taxable year, the District of Columbia
   consolidated return shall include the income of the corporation for only that
   part of the year that it is a member of the District of Columbia affiliated
   group. If the new member is an existing D.C. corporation and not a member of
   another District of Columbia affiliated group, a final short-year separate
   year return must be filed for the period prior to becoming a member of the
   affiliated group. If the new member was a member of another District of
   Columbia affiliated group, its taxable income or loss for the period prior to
   joining the new District of Columbia affiliated group must be included in the
   consolidated taxable income of its prior District of Columbia affiliated
   group. Correspondingly, if a member leaves a District of Columbia affiliated
   group, its taxable income or loss for the remainder of the taxable year shall
   be reported on a separate short-year tax return or included in the
   consolidated tax return of its new District of Columbia affiliated group,
   where permissible under these rules.
   
   
   
   (b)	District Taxable Income is computed as if a consolidated federal corporate
   income tax return was filed that included all Affiliates.
   
   
   
   (c)	The following are computed on a consolidated basis as if all Affiliates
   were a single corporation filing a District corporate income tax return:
   
   
   
   (1)	District adjustments and allocation of business income;
   
   
   
   (2)	Apportionment: Intergroup Transactions are eliminated when computing
   apportionment factors (See 9 DCMR §§ 109.20);
   
   
   
   (3)	Net Operating Loss;
   
   
   
   (4)	District Taxable Income is computed on a consolidated basis;
   
   
   
   (5)	District Franchise Tax;
   
   
   
   (6)	District Tax Credits; and
   
   
   
   (7)	Election and Revocation in accordance with 9 DCMR §§ 109.4 and 109.6.

   109.4. In order to file a District of Columbia consolidated return; the
   members of a District of Columbia affiliated group must be part of the
   affiliated group that files a federal consolidated return pursuant to § 1501
   of the IRC.
   
   
   
   (a)	If a group wishes to exercise its privilege of filing a consolidated
   return, such consolidated return must be filed not later than the last day
   prescribed by law (including extensions of time) for the filing of the common
   parent&#8217;s return. Such consolidated return may not be withdrawn after
   such last day.
   
   
   
   (b)	The election made by the common parent is effective prospectively and only
   if accompanied by a written consent to the election signed by each member of
   the District of Columbia affiliated group. The completed written consent of
   all members shall be attached to the District of Columbia consolidated return
   for the taxable year for which the election is made.
   
   
   
   (c)	Election to file a consolidated return is binding to the District of
   Columbia affiliated group for the first year of election and for subsequent
   years as long as the District of Columbia affiliated group remains in
   existence, unless a written request for revocation is submitted to the Office
   of Tax and Revenue and the Office of Tax and Revenue grants permission to a
   group to discontinue filing consolidated returns.
   
   
   
   (d)	The making of a District consolidated return shall be upon the condition
   that all corporations which at any time during the taxable year have been
   members of the affiliated group consent to all the consolidated return
   regulations prescribed under Title 9 of the District of Columbia Municipal
   Regulations prior to the last day prescribed by law for the filing of such
   return. The making of a District consolidated return shall be considered as
   such consent.
   
   
   
   (e)	If an eligible corporation becomes a member of the District of Columbia
   affiliated group after the beginning of the District of Columbia consolidated
   return year or ceases to be a member of the District of Columbia affiliated
   group during the consolidated return year, two tax returns will be due for
   that taxable year. The District of Columbia consolidated return shall include
   amounts attributable to such corporation for the part of the year in which it
   was a member of the District of Columbia affiliated group. A separate return
   shall be filed and include the amounts attributable to such corporation for
   the short taxable year when it was not a member of the District of Columbia
   affiliated group.

   109.5. In taxable years after the election, any corporation deriving gross
   income, in any amount, from District of Columbia sources that was not a member
   of the original federal affiliated group in the year of the election but is a
   member of the federal affiliated group in the current year shall be required
   to join the District of Columbia affiliated group.
   
   
   
   (a)	The new corporation shall be deemed to have waived any objection to the
   filing of the District of Columbia consolidated return by its consent, if any,
   to join in filing a District of Columbia consolidated return by the common
   parent of the District of Columbia affiliated group.
   
   
   
   (b)	The new member joining the District of Columbia affiliated group shall be
   required to consent to the election to file a District of Columbia
   Consolidated Corporation Franchise Tax Return. A written consent shall be
   attached to the District of Columbia consolidated return for the first taxable
   year in which the new member joins the District of Columbia affiliated group.

   109.6. The election shall terminate automatically upon the revocation or
   termination of the federal consolidated election, and the common parent shall
   notify the Office of Tax and Revenue within thirty (30) days regarding the
   revocation or termination of the federal consolidated election.
   
   
   
   (a)	If the District of Columbia affiliated group wants to revoke the election
   in a subsequent tax year, the group must request in writing and receive
   written permission from the Office of Tax and Revenue. The request to
   discontinue filing a D.C. consolidated return must be made at least ninety
   (90) days before the due date (including any extension of time for filing) of
   the return.
   
   
   
   (b)	If the request for revocation or termination of District of Columbia
   consolidated election is denied by the Office of Tax and Revenue, the District
   of Columbia affiliated group may file a written protest and request a hearing
   within thirty (30) days from the denial date.
   
   
   
   (c)	If a corporation has ceased to be a member of District of Columbia
   affiliated group and if such cessation resulted from a bona fide sale or
   exchange of its stock for fair value and occurred prior to the date upon which
   any deficiency is assessed, the Office of Tax and Revenue may make an
   assessment and collect the deficiency from the former member.

   109.7. If the District of Columbia affiliated group files a consolidated
   return for the first year of filing, it must make payment of estimated tax on
   a consolidated basis for subsequent years. The District of Columbia affiliated
   group is treated as a single corporation for purposes of D.C. Official Code
   47-1812.14(a) (relating to payment of estimated tax by corporations) and D.C.
   Official Code 47-1812.14(b) (relating to underpayment of estimated tax by
   corporations).
   
   
   
   (a)	If separate returns are filed by the members of the District of Columbia
   affiliated group for the taxable year after receiving consent for
   discontinuance from Office of Tax and Revenue, the amount of any estimated tax
   payments with respect to a consolidated payment of estimated tax for such year
   will be credited against the separate tax liabilities of the members in any
   manner designated by the common parent which is reasonably satisfactory to the
   Office of Tax and Revenue. For example, the manner of allocation will be
   satisfactory to the Office of Tax and Revenue if it does not jeopardize the
   collection of the corporation franchise tax liability from such members.
   
   
   
   (b)	Supporting schedules shall be filed with the District of Columbia
   consolidated tax return for each member. The statement of gross income and
   deductions and other schedules required for each corporation shall be prepared
   and filed in columnar form so that the details of the items of gross income,
   deductions, and credits for each member may be readily ascertained. A column
   shall also be provided giving effect to any eliminations and adjustments. The
   items included in the column for eliminations and adjustments should be
   symbolized to identify contra items affected, and suitable explanations
   appended, if necessary. Similar schedules shall contain a columnar form of
   reconciliation of retained earnings for each corporation, together with a
   reconciliation of consolidated retained earnings. Consolidated balance sheets
   at the beginning and close of the taxable year of the group shall accompany
   the consolidated return prepared in a form similar to that required for other
   schedules. Transactions with a subsidiary which is not included as part of the
   District consolidated return shall not be considered as intercompany
   transactions for elimination purposes in computing the consolidated District
   taxable income for the return period.

   109.8. Federal Taxable Income is computed as if a consolidated federal
   corporate income tax return was filed that included all Affiliates. Federal
   Treasury regulations under 26 Code of Federal Regulations § 1.1502 et seq.
   and interpretations thereof regarding intercompany transactions apply in
   determining the federal taxable income of a District consolidated group.

   109.9. ALLOCABLE INCOME [Reserved]

   109.10. The following adjustments may be made under these regulations:
   
   
   
   (a)	Nothing herein shall prevent the exercise of authority under D.C. Official
   Code § 47-1810.03 to distribute, apportion, or allocate income or deductions
   between or among corporations where such action is necessary in order to
   prevent evasion of taxes or clearly to reflect the income of any such
   corporation. OTR also has the authority to determine whether such method
   should be followed on a consistent basis, from year to year.
   
   
   
   (b)	The District may require that a consolidated return be filed under D.C.
   Official Code § 47-1805.02(D)(5)(C)(iv) for an affiliated group that is
   eligible but where an election to file a consolidated return has not been
   filed if the District determines that a consolidated return is necessary to
   prevent evasion of taxes or to clearly reflect the taxable income that is
   attributable to the business conducted in the District by the affiliated
   group.
   
   
   
   109.11 &#8211; 109.19	[Reserved]

   109.20. The three-factor apportionment requirements of D.C. Official Code §
   47-1810.02(d) shall be taken into account by an affiliated group doing
   business within and without the District of Columbia. All members of an
   affiliated group which join in the filing of a District consolidated tax
   return shall be considered as one &#8220;person&#8221; to determine the
   portion of the consolidated net income earned within and without the District
   by the same method prescribed in the statute cited above. All intercompany
   transactions shall be eliminated in the determination of the apportionment
   factors.
   
   
   
   (a)	A single consolidated apportionment factor is constructed for the
   affiliated group. The property, payroll, and sales factors include the
   property, payroll, and sales for all members of the consolidated group. The
   consolidated apportionment factor constructed is then multiplied by the
   consolidated adjusted federal income to determine the adjusted federal income
   apportioned to the District of Columbia.
   
   
   
   (b)	The members of the affiliated group may not determine separate
   apportionment factors to apply to their portion of the consolidated adjusted
   federal income.
   
   
   
   (c)	The District property factor for the consolidated group shall be
   determined pursuant to D.C. Official Code § 47-1810.02(e) and 9 DCMR §§ 125
   and 126.
   
   
   
   (d)	The District payroll factor for the consolidated group shall be determined
   pursuant to D.C. Official Code § 47-1810.02(f) and 9 DCMR §§ 125 and 127.
   
   
   
   (e)	The District sales factor for the consolidated group shall be determined
   pursuant to D.C. Official Code § 47-1810.02(g) and 9 DCMR §§ 125 and 128.
   
   
   
   (f)	Where all members of the consolidated group are subject to a special
   apportionment formula provided by D.C. Official Code § 47-1810.02(h), and
   approved by the Office of Tax and Revenue, the consolidated group will
   determine a single consolidated apportionment factor using the special
   formula. Where all members of the affiliated group are not subject to the
   identical special formula approved by the Office of Tax and Revenue, the
   special formula is not available to the affiliated group.
   
   
   
   (g)	Under D.C. Official Code § 47-1810.02(h), the following alternative
   methods may be requested or prescribed in respect to all or a part of
   taxpayer&#8217;s business activity where necessary to fairly represent the
   extent of taxpayer&#8217;s business activity in the District:
   
   
   
   (1)	Separate accounting;
   
   
   
   (2)	The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
   
   
   
   (3)	The inclusion of one or more additional factors that will fairly represent
   the taxpayer&#8217;s business activity in the District; or
   
   
   
   (4)	The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation
   and apportionment of the taxpayer&#8217;s income.
   
   
   
   (h)	The amounts of the property, payroll, and sales of a partnership are
   attributable to the partners or members of the joint venture. A corporation
   that is a partner in a partnership must add its share of the property,
   payroll, and sales to its own apportionment factors, regardless of whether the
   partnerships are District of Columbia partnerships. The affiliated group
   should include a separate schedule to show the distribution to each partner.
   
   
   
   (i)	Apportionment factors are subject to the adjustments set out in § 109.10,
   if necessary to clearly reflect income or to prevent the evasion of tax.
   
   
   
   109.21 &#8211; 109.29	[Reserved]

   109.30. In computing the net income of the consolidated group, there shall be
   allowed a deduction for the consolidated net operating loss, in the same
   manner as allowed under IRC §§ 172 and 1502 and the federal income tax
   regulations thereunder and D.C. Official Code Section 47-1803.03(a)(14).
   
   
   
   (a)	Since an affiliated group filing a District consolidated return often does
   not include all the members included in the federal return, the net operating
   loss deduction is limited to the amount of deduction that would otherwise be
   allowed for federal income tax purposes had the federal return been filed
   including only the District of Columbia entities for the tax year involved.
   The federal consolidated return must be adjusted to reflect only
   District-source losses.
   
   
   
   (b)	Each member of a District of Columbia affiliated group shall have its own
   net operating loss deduction (before apportionment) for loss years prior to
   2000 and D.C. apportioned net operating loss deduction (after apportionment)
   for loss years 2000 and thereafter where:
   
   
   
   (1)	such member filed a separate District of Columbia franchise tax return for
   years 2000 and thereafter, or
   
   
   
   (2)	such member was included in a different District of Columbia affiliated
   group for years 2001 and thereafter.
   
   
   
   (c)	The following is an example of the application of § 109.30(b):
   
   
   
   Corporation A files a return on separate company basis for tax year 2000 and
   has a D.C.-apportioned net operating loss of $ 50,000 to be carried forward to
   subsequent years. For taxable year 2001, Corporation A joins with Corporation
   B to file a consolidated return. Corporation A utilizes only $ 30,000 of its $
   50,000 D.C.-apportioned net operating loss from taxable year 2000 to the
   extent of its total taxable income of $ 30,000 for taxable year 2001.

   (d)	If the District of Columbia affiliated group has a consolidated net
   operating loss carry forward from prior taxable years, the consolidated net
   operating loss of that District of Columbia affiliated group shall be carried
   forward and utilized by such District of Columbia affiliated group to the
   extent that such District of Columbia affiliated group has apportioned
   District of Columbia taxable income in future years.

   (f)	The Separate Return Limitation Year (SRLY) provisions of IRC § 172 and
   IRC § 1502, and the federal income tax regulations thereunder, shall apply in
   those cases where a member of a District of Columbia affiliated group which
   has a D.C.-apportioned net operating loss carryforward leaves the group and
   either files a separate District of Columbia franchise tax return or joins in
   the filing of a consolidated return with a different District of Columbia
   affiliated group. The prorated amount assigned to each member who incurred the
   loss is determined by the following formula:
   
   
   
   (A/B) x C = D
   
   A/B = Ratio based on one corporation&#8217;s loss to total corporation losses
   
   C = Consolidated net operating loss
   
   D = Prorated amount of consolidated net operating loss assigned to the member.
   
   
   
   (g)	The following is an example of the application of § 109.30(f):
   
   
   
   In 2001 Corporations B and C were members of a District of Columbia affiliated
   group which had Corporation A as the common parent. On January 1, 2002
   Corporation B and Corporation C became members of a different District of
   Columbia affiliated group the common parent of which was Corporation D.
   
   
   
   The ABC consolidated group had a consolidated loss of $ 20,000 for tax year
   2001.

   Calculation of Corporation B&#8217;s share of Tax Year 2001 Consolidated Loss:
   
   
   
   A = [80,000) for Corporation B
   
   B = [120,000) for Corporation B and Corporation C
   
   C = [20,000) for consolidated loss
   
   ($ 80,000/$ 120,000) x $ 20,000 = $ 13,333 loss assigned to Corporation B
   
   Calculation of Corporation C's share of Tax Year 2001 Consolidated Loss:
   
   A = [40,000) for Corporation B
   
   B = [120,000) for Corporation B and Corporation C
   
   C = [20,000) for consolidated loss
   
   ($ 40,000/$ 120,000) x $ 20,000 = $ 6,667 loss assigned to Corporation C.
