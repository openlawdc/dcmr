                                  DC REGULATIONS

SUPPLEMENTAL WAGE PAYMENTS (ยง 9-139)

139.1. If supplemental wages (such as bonuses, commissions, or overtime pay)
   are paid at the same time as regular wages, the tax to be withheld shall be
   determined as if the aggregate of the supplemental and regular wages were a
   single wage payment for the regular payroll period.

   139.2. If supplemental wages are paid at a different time, the employer shall
   determine the tax to be withheld by aggregating the supplemental wage either
   with the regular wages for the current payroll period or with the regular
   wages for the last preceding payroll period with the same calendar year.

   139.3. If an employee receives vacation pay for the time of a vacation
   absence, the vacation pay shall be subject to withholding as though it were a
   regular wage payment made for the payroll period or periods which occur during
   the vacation.

   139.4. If vacation pay is paid in addition to regular wages to an employee who
   forgoes his or her vacation, those payments shall be treated as supplemental
   wages.
