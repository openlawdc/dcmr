                                  DC REGULATIONS

MODIFICATIONS TO INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS (§ 9-153)

153.1. Income from annuities and pensions may be modified, and the income may
   be deducted to arrive at the District adjusted gross income under the
   following circumstances:
   
   
   
   (a)	If, under the provisions of § 72(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code
   (relating to employees&#8217; contributions recoverable in three (3) years),
   the taxpayer&#8217;s contribution to a pension or annuity has not been
   recovered;
   
   
   
   (b)	If amounts received as an annuity or under a pension plan were reported to
   the District as income under the three percent (3%) rule in effect for years
   prior to January 1, 1982 (§ 2(b)(2) of title III of the Act); and
   
   
   
   (c)	If a computation to support the deduction provided for under this
   subsection is submitted with the taxpayer&#8217;s return.

   153.2. The following example illustrates the application of this subsection
   (Taxpayer retired December 31, 1979. Taxpayer&#8217;s contribution to pension
   $ 15,000.):
   
   
   
   Year
   
   Pension Income
   
   Included in Federal Gross Income
   
   Included in D.C. Gross Income
   
   
   
   1980
   
   $6.000
   
   -0- (Cost not recovered)
   
   $ 450 (3% Rule)
   
   
   
   1981
   
   6.400
   
   -0- (Cost not recovered)
   
   $ 450 (3% Rule)
   
   
   
   1982
   
   6,900
   
   $ 4,300 (Excess over $ 15,000 cost)
   
   $ 4,300* (Federal Conformity)
   
   
   
   
   
   *The modification to District gross income would be nine hundred dollars ($
   900), since that amount was previously taxable in the District.

   153.3. Income received from retirement plans may be reduced to the extent that
   contributions to the plans were subject to District income tax in years
   beginning prior to January 1, 1982.

   153.4. The following example illustrates the application of this subsection:
   (Taxpayer contributed a total of four thousand dollars ($ 4,000) to an IRA
   plan for years beginning prior to January 1, 1982. In 1982, taxpayer will be
   eligible to withdraw the entire amount if he or she elects to do so.)
   
   
   
   
   
   Year
   
   Contrzibutions Included Federal Gross Income
   
   Contributions Included in D.C. Gross Income
   
   
   
   Years Prior to 1982
   
   -0-
   
   $ 4,000
   
   
   
   1982
   
   $ 4,000
   
   $ 4,000*
   
   
   
   
   
   *The modification to D.C. adjusted gross income would be four thousand dollars
   ($ 4,000), since this amount has been previously taxed by the District.

   153.5. Interest received on the amount of contribution withdrawn shall be
   taxable.

   153.6. Carryovers of charitable contributions are allowable in the same manner
   and to the same extent as permitted under § 170(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue
   Code; Provided, that no deduction shall be allowed for carryovers of
   contributions made prior to January 1, 1982.

   153.7. In the case of two (2) earner married couples, the deduction permitted
   under § 221 of the Internal Revenue Code shall not be applicable to the
   District of Columbia individual income tax returns, since such deduction
   serves only to adjust federal tax rates.

   153.8. If a taxpayer is an owner of an entity subject to the unincorporated
   business franchise tax, the individual taxable income of the taxpayer shall be
   reduced by his or her share of income taxed to the unincorporated business.

   153.9. The dividend exclusions allowed to corporations under § 243 of the
   Internal Revenue Code shall not be applicable to the Act.
