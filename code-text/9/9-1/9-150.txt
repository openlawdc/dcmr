OVERPAYMENT OF TAX AND REFUND SET-OFFS (§ 9-150)

150.1. If it is determined by the Deputy Chief Financial Officer that there
   has been an overpayment of any tax (whether as deficiency or otherwise),
   interest shall be allowed and paid upon that overpayment of tax at the rate of
   six per cent (6%) per annum from the date the overpayment was paid until the
   date of refund, except as otherwise provided in this section or the Act.

   150.2. That part of any overpayment which was not assessed and paid as a
   deficiency or as additional tax shall bear interest only from the date on
   which a claim for refund was filed:

   150.3. Interest on overpayments resulting from excessive withholding,
   excessive payments on declarations, or both, shall in no event begin to accrue
   prior to ninety (90) days after the overpayment is made or after the date of
   the filing of a final return, whichever is later.

   150.4. For the purposes of this section, any tax deducted and withheld during
   any calendar year and any amounts paid except as provided for in § 149.2
   prior to the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month after the close of
   the taxable year as estimated tax shall be deemed to have been paid on the
   fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month following the close of the
   taxable year.

   150.5. No interest may be paid unless a properly completed claim for refund is
   filed with the Deputy Chief Financial Officer.

   150.6. If the final return filed by an individual for the taxable year shows

   declarations, or both, an automatic refund of the overpayment shall be made;
   Provided, that all of the withholding statements supporting all of the
   withholding taxes claimed as a credit is submitted with the final income tax
   return. No interest on overpayments shall be allowed or paid on refunds made
   in this manner.

   150.7. If a final return shows an overpayment of less than two dollars ($ 2),
   it shall be refunded only upon application to the Deputy Chief Financial
   Officer.

   150.8. No refund of estimated tax previously paid shall be made except upon
   the filing of a final income tax return on Form D-40 after the close of the
   taxable year.

   150.9. Each claim for refund shall be in writing, under oath, and shall state
   the specific grounds upon which the claim is based.

   150.10. Forms to be used in filing a claim for refund may be obtained from the
   Deputy Chief Financial Officer, upon request.

   150.11. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, a refund due on
   the return of an individual may be intercepted by the Deputy Chief Financial
   Officer, Office of Tax and Revenue in accordance with the provisions of §
   11(a) of Title XII of the Act (D.C. Code § 47-1812(a)(4)(4a)) as amended.

   150.12. For the purposes of this section, the term &#8220;set-off&#8221; shall
   mean the amount of a District of Columbia income tax refund intercepted from
   an individual who is in default on a National Direct Student Loan or a Nursing
   Student Loan or who is in arrears on court-ordered child support payments, or
   any combination thereof.

   150.13. For the purposes of this section, the phrase, &#8220;affected
   agency&#8221; means the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The Department of Human Services for an arrearage of court-ordered child
   support payments; or
   
   
   
   (b)	The University of the District of Columbia for a default of a National
   Direct Student Loan or a Nursing Student Loan, or both.

   150.14. For the purposes of this section, the phrase &#8220;authorized
   official&#8221; shall mean, as it applies to the affected agency, the Deputy
   Director of the Department of Human Services or the Vice President of the
   Financial Management Division of the University of District of Columbia.

   150.15. The interception of a refund requested by married persons filing on a
   combined separate form (Columns A and B of Form D-40) shall be limited to the
   net refund attributable to the spouse who has a set-off. The following example
   illustrate the application of § 150.15:
   
   
   
   Example A:
   
   
   
   Husband
   
   (Col A)
   
   Refund
   
   $ 200.00
   
   
   
   Wife
   
   (Col. B)
   
   Refund
   
      100.00
   
   
   
   Total Refund
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   $ 300.00
   
   
   
   
   
   The husband has a set-off. He is in arrears of child-support payments. Only
   two hundred dollars ($ 200.00) is subject to interception.
   
   
   
   Example B:
   
   
   
   Husband
   
   (Col. A)
   
   Refund
   
   $ 200.00
   
   
   
   Wife
   
   (Col. B)
   
   Balance
   
   $ 250.00
   
   
   
   Net Balance Due
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   $ 50.00
   
   
   
   
   
   The husband is in arrears of child-support payments, a set-off, but no refund
   is due. Therefore, no interception can be made.
   
   
   
   Example C:
   
   
   
   Husband
   
   (Col. A)
   
   Balance Due
   
   $ 100.00
   
   
   
   Wife
   
   (Col. B)
   
   Refund
   
   $ 150.00
   
   
   
   Net Balance Due
   
   
   
   
   
   $ 50.00
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The wife is in default under the federal student loan program. A set-off is
   made. Although she computes a refund of one hundred and fifty dollars ($
   150.00), only the net refund of fifty dollars ($ 50) is subject to
