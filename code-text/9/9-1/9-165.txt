                                  DC REGULATIONS

COMBINED REPORTING[COLON] NET OPERATING LOSSES (ยง 9-165)

165.1. Post-apportioned net operating loss carryforwards.  A combined group
   member may carry forward its District apportioned net operating loss to the
   extent the carryforward and offset is consistent with the requirements and
   limitations of D.C. Official Code ยง 47-1803.03(a)(14).  A District
   apportioned net operating loss carryforward is an attribute of the separate
   entity rather than of the combined group.  A combined group member may not
   share all or a portion of its net operating loss carryforward with other
   members of the combined group or as an offset against the total income of the
   combined group.  A District apportioned net operating loss carryforwards shall
   be allowed to offset only the District taxable income of the combined group
   member that created the net operating loss.

   165.2. Pre-combination net operating loss carryforwards.  Each member of a
   combined group shall have its own net operating loss carryforward deduction
   (before apportionment) for loss years prior to 2000 and District apportioned
   net operating loss deduction (after apportionment) for loss years 2000 and
   thereafter where:
   
   
   
   (a)	Such member filed a separate District franchise tax return for tax years
   beginning before January 1, 2011; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Such member was included in a District consolidated return for tax years
   beginning before January 1, 2011, in which case, the net operating loss shall
   be determined on a separate entity basis by using the prorated amount of the
   consolidated net operating loss assigned to the District consolidated member
   if that member had a loss.

   165.3. Example:  Applying an NOL in a Combined Report.
