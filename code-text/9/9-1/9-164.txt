COMBINED REPORTING[COLON] COMBINING SPECIAL APPORTIONMENT FORMULAS (§ 9-164)

164.1. Combined groups which include some members which are required to use
   the four (4)-factor apportionment formula and other members which are required
   to use a special apportionment method are subject to apportionment as
   described below:
   
   
   
   (a)  	Combined group members who use the four (4)-factor formula and those
   that use special apportionment methods for purposes of allocation and
   apportionment shall prepare a federal consolidated pro forma return consisting
   of all combined group members, including the elimination of all intercompany
   transactions, regardless of whether between or among combined group members
   who use the four (4)-factor formula and/or those that use special
   apportionment formulas;
   
   
   
   (b)  	Each member shall separately compute its District apportionment factor
   numerators, determine its District apportionment factor based on the group’s
   denominators, and then apply its factors to the group’s business income or
   loss subject to apportionment to arrive at net income or loss apportioned to
   the District; 
   
   (c)  	Each member shall compute its nonbusiness income separately subject to
   the allocation rules;
   
   
   
   (d)  	All income or loss allocated and apportioned to the District by each
   member shall be added together to arrive at District taxable income for each
   member; and
   
   
   
   (e)  	Each member shall apply the appropriate District income tax rate to
   determine the proper District tax due.
