                                  DC REGULATIONS

FILING ESTIMATED TAX DECLARATIONS AND PAYMENT OF TAX (§ 9-147)

147.1. The Act requires that the first payment of tax shall always accompany
   the filing of the declaration first filed by the taxpayer.

   147.2. If the taxpayer first meets the requirement for filing a declaration
   after September 15th (or in the case of a fiscal year taxpayer, after the 15th
   day of the 9th month of the fiscal year), the taxpayer may file an income tax
   return on or before the 15th day of the 1st month of the succeeding taxable
   year (in lieu of making a declaration) and the return shall be considered a
   declaration. In such cases, the entire tax shall be paid with the return.

   147.3. If the taxpayer fails to file a declaration at the time required
   (including any extension of time), he or she shall pay, when the declaration
   is filed, all installments of estimated tax which he or she would have paid
   had he or she filed the declaration at the required time. Any remaining
   installments of tax shall be paid in the amounts and at the times they would
   be payable if the declaration had been filed at the required time.

   147.4. In the case of an amended declaration filed pursuant to § 145.4, there
   shall be paid concurrently with the filing of the amended declaration an
   amount which, when added to amounts paid on declarations previously filed for
   the same taxable year, will aggregate the amount which would have been paid
   had the amended declaration been filed as the original declaration. Any
   remaining installments of tax to be paid after the filing of the amended
   declaration shall be based upon the amended declaration.

   147.5. No refund of estimated tax previously paid shall be made except upon
   the filing of a final income tax return on Form D-40 after the close of the
   taxable year.

   147.6. No extension of time shall be granted for filing a declaration of
   estimated tax and for paying any amount shown on the declaration to be due
   unless on or before the date that the declaration is required to be filed or
   payment of tax is required to be made an application for an extension is filed
   with the District.

   147.7. Each application for extension of time to file shall state the reason
   why an extension of time is desired by the taxpayer.

   147.8. Except for taxpayers who are abroad, no extension for filing
   declarations may be granted for a period longer than six (6) months.

   147.9. The following table sets forth the time for filing of declarations and
