DEDUCTION (§ 9-175)

175.1. Eligibility.  If the enactment of combined reporting requirements for
   unitary businesses in the District results in an increase to a combined
   group&#8217;s net deferred tax liability, the combined group is entitled to a
   FAS 109 deduction.  “Net deferred tax liability” is defined as the net
   increase, if any, in deferred tax liabilities minus the net increase, if any,
   in deferred tax assets of the combined group, as computed in accordance with
   Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) that would otherwise result
   from the imposition combined reporting in the District.  Only companies that
   were publicly traded as of January 1, 2011 and that prepare their financial
   statements in accordance with GAAP qualify for the FAS 109 deduction.  The
   term “publicly traded company” shall mean a company whose stock is
   publicly traded; a privately held company that issues publicly traded debt is
   not eligible for the FAS 109 deduction.

   175.2. Timing of the deduction. The FAS 109 deduction shall be claimed
   annually over a seven (7)-year period beginning with the combined group’s
   taxable year that begins in 2015 equal to one-seventh (1/7) of the deduction
   amount.

   175.3. Filing requirements. Any taxpayer intending to claim the FAS 109
   deduction shall file a form with the group’s combined report with the Chief
   Financial Officer on or before the due date for the 2012 District franchise
   tax returns, specifying the total amount of the deduction which the taxpayer
   claims.  This rule does not limit the authority to the Chief Financial
   Officer to review or redetermine the proper amount of any deduction claimed,
   whether on the form required or on a tax return for any taxable year.

   175.4. Recordkeeping requirements. To facilitate review and potential audit of
   the taxpayer’s form and any claimed deduction, a taxpayer shall maintain
   records and workpapers necessary to support the calculation and journal
   entries identified for the full length of taxable years in which the deduction
   may be claimed, and all additional periods of time for which such taxable
   years may be subject to audit or adjustment.
