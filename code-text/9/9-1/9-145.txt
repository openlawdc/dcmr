   145.2. For the purpose of making a declaration, the amount of gross income
   which the taxpayer can reasonably be expected to receive or accrue (as the
   case may be, depending upon the method accounting used to compute net income);
   and the amount of the estimated allowable deduction, personal exemptions, and
   credit for dependents to be taken into account in computing the amount of the
   estimated tax shall be determined on the basis of facts and circumstances
   existing at the time prescribed for the filing of the declaration.

   145.3. The declaration shall contain the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The amount estimated as the tax for the taxable year;
   
   
   
   (b)	The amount estimated by the taxpayer as the credit for taxes withheld at
   the source for the taxable year; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The excess, if any, of the amount shown under paragraph (a) over the
   amount shown under paragraph (b), which excess shall be the estimated tax for
   the taxable year.

   145.4. An amended declaration may be made in any case in which the taxpayer
   estimates that gross income, deductions, or credits will differ from the gross
   income, deductions, or credits reflected in the previous declaration.

   145.5. An amended declaration may also be made based upon a change in the
   number of exemption to which the taxpayer may be entitled for the then current
   year.
