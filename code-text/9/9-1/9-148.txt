                                  DC REGULATIONS

USE OF TAX RETURN AS A DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX (ยง 9-148)

148.1. If a taxpayer files a District income tax return for a calendar year on
   or before January 15th of the succeeding calendar year (or if the taxpayer is
   on a fiscal year basis, on or before the 15th day of the first month
   immediately following the close of that fiscal year) and pays in full the
   amount of tax shown on the return as payable, that return shall also be
   considered a declaration for the taxable year if the taxpayer first met the
   requirement with respect to filing declaration after September 1st of the
   taxable year (or the 1st day of the ninth month of the taxable year for fiscal
   year taxpayers).

   148.2. If the tax shown on the return differs from the estimated tax shown in
   the previously filed declaration, the return shall be considered as an amended
   declaration the filing of which before the 15th day of the first month
   following the close of the taxable year is permitted.

   148.3. If a taxpayer files on or before September 15th a timely declaration
   for that year and after that (on or before January 15th of the succeeding
   taxable year or corresponding date in the case of a taxpayer on a fiscal year
   basis) files a return for that year, and pays at the time of filing the tax
   shown by the return to be payable, the return shall be treated as an amended
   declaration timely filed.

   148.4. For the purposes of this section a taxpayer may file a return, Form
   D-40, on or before the 15th day of the first month following the close of the
   taxable year even though he or she has not been furnished Form D-2 by his or
   her employer.

   148.5. When filing a return in accordance with ยง 148.4, the taxpayer shall
   compute, as accurately as possible, his or her wages for the year and the tax
   withheld for which he or she is entitled to a credit; and shall report those
   wages and tax on the return, Form D-40, together with all other pertinent
   information necessary to the determination of tax liability for that year.
