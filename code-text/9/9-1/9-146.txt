                                  DC REGULATIONS

JOINT DECLARATIONS OF ESTIMATED TAX (ยง 9-146)

146.1. A joint declaration may be made by husband and wife, in which case
   liability with respect to estimated tax shall be joint and several.

   146.2. No joint declaration may be made if the husband and wife are separated
   under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance, or if they have
   different taxable years.

   146.3. If a joint declaration is made, but a joint return is not made for the
   taxable year, the estimated tax for that year may be treated as the estimated
   tax of either husband or wife, or may be divided between them.

   146.4. The making of a joint declaration does not require the husband and wife
   to file a joint final return. However, if a husband and wife make separate
   declarations, they cannot file a joint return.

   146.5. If a joint declaration is made but separate returns are made for the
   taxable year, the estimated tax for that year may be treated as the estimated
   tax of either the husband or the wife or may be divided between them in any
   proportion they may choose.
