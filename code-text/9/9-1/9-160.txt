COMBINED REPORTING[COLON] STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS (ยง 9-160)

160.1. Statute of limitations.  If the statute of limitations applicable to
   refund claims and assessments is open with respect to a particular member of
   the combined group, the statute of limitations is open with respect to that
   particular taxpayer notwithstanding the fact that the statute of limitations
   may have expired for one or more other members of the combined group.

   160.2. The statute of limitations applicable to refund claims and assessments
   for members of a combined reporting group which have filed their tax return
   based on a fiscalized reporting period matched to the accounting period of the
   designated agent shall be the statute of limitations determined and computed
   based on the fiscalized accounting period.

   160.3. If a return is filed pursuant to a combined report, the Chief Financial
   Officer may examine and audit that return, and collect any deficiency from a
   combined group member for whom the statute of limitations for assessments has
   not expired, even if the statute of limitations for other members which filed
   pursuant to the same combined report has expired. Any deficiency assessed
   pursuant to the audit or examination will not cause a reopening of the statute
   of limitations for those other members for which the statute of limitations
   has expired who filed pursuant to the same combined report.
