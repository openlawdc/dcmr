   141.2. An employee shall be entitled to the following number of withholding
   exemptions (except as limited by § 141.3):
   
   
   
   (a)	One (1) withholding exemption for the employee;

   (c)	One (1) additional withholding exemption for each dependent, as defined in
   the Act;
   
   
   
   (d)	If the employee is married and lives with the spouse, the one (1)
   withholding exemption to which the spouse is entitled, or would be entitled if
   the spouse were an employee, under § 141.2(a);
   
   
   
   (e)	One (1) additional withholding exemption if the employee or the
   employee&#8217;s spouse will have attained the age of sixty-five (65) before
   the close of the employee&#8217;s taxable year; or two (2) additional
   withholding exemptions if both the employee and spouse will have attained the
   age of sixty-five (65) before the close of the employee&#8217;s taxable year
   and the employee claims both these exemptions;
   
   
   
   (f)	One (1) additional withholding exemption if the employee or the
   employee&#8217;s spouse is blind at the close of the employee&#8217;s taxable
   year; or two (2) additional withholding exemptions if both the employee and
   spouse are blind at the close of the employee&#8217;s taxable year and the
   employee claims both exemptions; and
   
   
   
   (g)	Employees may claim additional exemptions in accordance with the
   provisions of § 8(e)(8) of Title 12 of the Act if estimated itemized
   deductions for the taxable year exceed the zero bracket amount to which the
   employee is entitled.

   141.3. The additional exemptions allowed under paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of
   § 141.2 shall be allowed only if the employee&#8217;s spouse does not have in
   effect a withholding exemption certificate claiming the same withholding
   exemptions.

   141.4. For the purposes of this chapter, an individual is blind only if his or
   her central visual acuity does not exceed 20/200 in the better eye with
   correcting lenses, or if visual acuity is greater than 20/200 but is
   accompanied by a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest
   diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than twenty degrees
   (20°).

   141.5. Employers shall be required to allow withholding exemptions to each
   employee on the basis of a withholding exemption certificate signed by the
   employee.

   141.6. If an employee fails to furnish a certificate, the employer shall
   withhold the tax as if the employee had claimed no withholding exemptions.

   141.7. The employer shall not be required to determine whether the employee
   had claimed the correct number of exemptions; however, if there is reason to
   believe that the employee has claimed an excessive number of exemptions, the
   Department of Finance and Revenue shall be so advised.
