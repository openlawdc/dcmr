ALLOCATION AND APPORTIONMENT APPLICABLE TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (§ 9-129)

129.1. The District shall impose on a financial institution a franchise tax
   measured by net income, determined by multiplying the financial
   institution&#8217;s base by an apportionment fraction, the numerator of which
   is the sum of the payroll factor and the gross income factor and the
   denominator of which is 2. For this purpose the base to which the
   apportionment fraction is applied shall be the financial institution&#8217;s
   net income for that taxable year as defined under Title III of the Act.

   129.2. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total
   amount paid or accrued in the District by the financial institution as
   compensation and the denominator of which is the total amount paid or accrued
   everywhere by the financial institution as compensation during the taxable
   year.

   129.3. Compensation shall be paid in the District if paid to any employee
   considered to be located or as having regular presence therein.

   129.4. All compensation paid by a financial institution to an employee located
   in a State in which the financial institution is not taxable shall be deemed
   to have been paid in the District of Columbia, if the financial institution
   has its principal office located in the District of Columbia.

   129.5. The gross income factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
   financial institution&#8217;s gross income located in the District during the
   taxable year and the denominator of which is the total gross income of the
   financial institution during the taxable year.

   129.6. All gross income described in §§ 129.9 through 129.11 which is
   located in a jurisdiction in which the financial institution is not subject to
   a &#8220;doing business tax&#8221; shall be deemed to be located in the
   District of Columbia if the principal office of the financial institution is
   located in the District.

   129.7. A financial institution whose commercial domicile is in the District
   and who is subject to a &#8220;doing business tax&#8221; in another
   jurisdiction, shall include in the numerator of the income factor for the
   District any income not required by the other jurisdiction to be included in
   the numerator of an income factor.

   129.8. [Deleted] 32 DCR 1354, 1358 (March 8, 1985).

   129.9. The interest, loan placement fees, discount and net gain from each
   unsecured loan and each loan secured primarily by tangible or intangible
   personal property, or any participating interest therein, shall be located in
   the District if the loan is originated in the District.

   129.10. In the case of a financial institution whose commercial domicile is in
   the District, income from securities, investments, money market instruments or
   from any other source not required to be apportioned outside the District
   shall be located in the District.

   129.11. The income referred to in § 129.10 shall include, but not be limited
   to, interest, dividends and net gains.

   129.12. Except as provided for in § 129.7, fees, commissions, service
   charges, and other forms of gross income from the sales of depository or
   financial services shall be located in the District if the service is
   performed therein.

   129.13. Sales or services rendered in two (2) or more taxing jurisdictions
   shall for the purposes of the numerator be included in the numerator of the
   jurisdiction in which the greater portion of the income-producing activity is
   performed, based on costs of performance.

   129.14. Gross income from the lease of tangible property shall be considered
   to be located in the District if the property is located therein.

   129.15. Except as otherwise provided in this section, tangible property,
   including real property which is security for a loan, shall be considered to
   be located in the jurisdiction in which the property is physically situated.

   129.16. Tangible personal property which is characteristically moving
   property, such as motor vehicles, rolling stock, aircraft, vessels, mobile
   equipment, and the like, and which is leased to others for use, shall be
   considered to be located in the District if the following conditions are met:
   
   
   
   (a)	The operation of the property by the lessee is entirely within the
   District, or the operation without the District is occasional or incidental to
   its operation within the District; or
   
   
   
   (b)	The operation of the property by the lessee is in two (2) or more
   jurisdictions, but the principal base of operations from which the property is
   sent out by the lessee is in the District.
