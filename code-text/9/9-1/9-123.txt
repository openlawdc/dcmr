                                  DC REGULATIONS

DEDUCTIONS WHEN INCOME IS APPORTIONABLE OR EXEMPT (§ 9-123)

123.1. No deductions shall be allowed for expenses applicable to any income
   not subject to or exempt from taxation under the Act.

   123.2. Where part of any income is apportioned to the District, the deductions
   applicable to that income and allowable as such under § 3(a) of Title 3 of
   the Act shall be apportioned on the same basis as that used to apportion the
   income, unless, in the opinion of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer, those
   deductions should be allocated in whole or in part.

   123.3. In the case of corporations, unincorporated businesses, and financial
   institutions, the deductions provided for in § 3(a) of Title 3 shall be
   allowable only to the extent that they are connected with income fairly
   attributable to the trade of business carried on or engaged in within the
   District and from District sources.

   123.4. In the context of this section, interest expenses of a corporation,
   financial institution, or unincorporated business shall be reduced by the
   amount that the ratio of the average value of the assets producing nontaxable
   income bears to the average value of the total assets of the corporation,
   financial institution or unincorporated business.

   123.5. Average values of assets shall be computed by one of the following
   methods:
   
   
   
   (a)	By adding the values at the beginning and end of a taxable year and
   dividing the result by 2;
   
   
   
   (b)	By using an average daily balance; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Any other method of computation the taxpayer can support with adequate
   records that clearly reflect the average value of assets.
   
   
   
   Example:
   
   Average Value of Assets Producing Nontaxable Income
   
   
   
   $ 150,000
   
   
   
   Average Value of Total Assets

   123.6. Administrative expense (such as salaries for officers or employees
   whose duties include the management of or investing securities, the income
   from which is not subject to taxation under the Act), shall be apportioned or
   allocated in a manner that reflects that portion of salaries attributable to
   taxable and nontaxable activities.
   
   
   
   Example:
   
   Officer and Employee Salaries
   
   $ 200,000
   
   
   
   Portion of working hours attributable to activities not taxable
   
   2%
   
   
   
   Salary expense required to be allocated to nontaxable activities (2% ×$
   200.000)
   
   $ 4,000
   
   
   
   Salary expense apportionable to taxable activities
   
   $ 196,000
