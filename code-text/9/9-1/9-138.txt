ADDITIONAL WITHHOLDING (§ 9-138)

138.1. Amounts, in addition to taxes required to be withheld, may be withheld
   by an employer under an agreement between the employer and employee.

   138.2. Additional amounts withheld pursuant to an employer-employee agreement,
   together with the amounts otherwise required to be withheld, shall be
   considered the amounts required to be deducted and withheld.

   138.3. The additional withholding, together with the amounts otherwise
   required to be withheld, shall be reported on Form D-2 as income tax withheld
   from wages.

   138.4. The agreement shall be in writing in the form prescribed by the Deputy
   Chief Financial Officer, and shall be executed in duplicate by the employer
   and the employee. One (1) copy of the agreement shall be retained by the
   employer and one (1) copy shall be retained by the employee.

   138.5. An agreement for additional withholding shall be effective for the
   period as may be mutually agreed upon; however, unless the agreement provides
   for an earlier termination, either the employer or employee may terminate the
   agreement by giving written notice effective with respect to the first payment
   of wages made on or after the first status determination date (January 1st or
   July 1st), which occurs at least thirty (30) days after the date on which the
   notice is given.
