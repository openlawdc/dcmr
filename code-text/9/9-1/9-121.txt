121.1. As defined in Title 1 of the Act, the words &#8220;trade or
   business&#8221; include the engaging in or carrying on of any trade, business,
   profession, vocation, vocation, calling, or commercial activity in the
   District, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

   121.2. The Act provides that the words &#8220;trade or business&#8221; shall
   not include, for the purposes of the Act, any of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Sales of tangible personal property whereby title to the property passes
   within or outside the District by a corporation, financial institution, or
   unincorporated business which does not physically have or maintain an office,
   warehouse, or other place of business in the District, and which has no
   officer, representative, or agent with an office or other place of business in
   the District during the taxable year;
   
   
   
   (b)	The words &#8220;agent&#8221; and &#8220;representative,&#8221; as used in
   § 121.2(a), shall not include any independent broker engaged independently in
   regularly soliciting orders in the District for sellers and who holds himself
   or herself out as such; and
   
   
   
   (c)	While it is not the purpose of this chapter to give specific definitions
   which may cover most conceivable kinds of employment or activity which come
   within the statutory definition of &#8220;trade or business,&#8221; the
   following general definitions are important:
   
   
   
   (1)	A &#8220;business&#8221; is that which occupies the time, attention, and
   labor of persons for the purpose of livelihood or profit. Engaging in business
   involves the investment of time or capital, or both, on the future outcome of
   the enterprise, whether it be successful or unsuccessful; and
   
   
   
   (2)	&#8220;Commerce&#8221; consists of intercourse and traffic, and includes
   the transportation of persons and property as well as the purchase, sale, and
   exchange of commodities.

   121.3. A corporation, financial institution, or unincorporated business may
   derive income from the sale of real property located in the District, from
   services performed in the District, from rental of real or personal property
   located in the District, from investments made or other capital employed in
   the District, and in other ways, and thus be liable for the tax upon that
   income, even though it maintains no office or other place of business in the
   District.

   121.4. Income from sales of tangible personal property shall be taxable
   (except as set forth in § 121.1) if the taxpayer has or maintains an office,
   warehouse, or other place of business in the District, or has an officer,
   agent, or representative having an office or other place of business in the
   District during the taxable year.
