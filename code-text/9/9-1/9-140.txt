                                  DC REGULATIONS

WAGES PAID ON BEHALF OF TWO OR MORE EMPLOYERS (ยง 9-140)

140.1. If a payment of wages is made to an employee by an employer through an
   agent, fiduciary (or other person who also has the control, receipt, custody,
   or disposal of, or pays the wages payable by another employer to the
   employee), the amount of the tax required to be withheld on each wage payment
   shall be determined upon the aggregate amount of that wage payment or payments
   in the same manner as if the aggregate amount had been paid by one employer.

   140.2. The determination made in accordance with ยง 140.1 shall be made
   without regard to whether the wages are paid separately on behalf of each
   employer or paid in a lump sum on behalf of all employers.

   140.3. Each employer shall be liable for the return and payment of a pro rata
   portion of the tax. In other words, each employer&#8217;s portion shall be
   based on the ratio of the amount paid as wages by that particular employer to
   the aggregate of all wages.
