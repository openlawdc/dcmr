COMBINED REPORTING[COLON] APPORTIONMENT (§ 9-169)

169.1. The Joyce Rule.  For apportionment purposes, the principle established
   in Appeal of Joyce, Inc. (Cal. SBOE 11/23/66) shall apply, in which each
   taxpayer member of the combined group is treated as a separate taxpayer and
   that taxpayer’s numerators will include only that taxpayer’s own property,
   payroll, and sales factor numerators attributable to the District and will not
   include a share of a non-nexus member’s factors.  Each taxpayer member’s
   denominator shall contain the property, payroll, and sales of the entire
   combined group wherever those property, payroll, and sales are attributed
   regardless of nexus.  The following example illustrates the Joyce method:
   
   
   
   Entity Name
   
   
   
   District Receipts
   
   Everywhere Receipts
