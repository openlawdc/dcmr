   tax year 1988 return due by July 31, 1987; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Nine-twelfth (9/12) of the amount of personal property tax paid with the
   tax year 1988 return due by July 31, 1987, multiplied by the following
   fraction:

   X
   
   Receipts on which District gross re-ceipts tax was paid for twelve months

   X
   
   Value of personal property every where July 1 of Column (1) tax year

   The following are examples of the application of § 3504.2:
   
   
   
   (1)	The taxpayer has property valued at one hundred thousand dollars
   ($100,000) subject to District personal property tax, and personal property
   everywhere of one million dollars ($1,000,000) on July 1, 1987. The
   taxpayer&#8217;s gross receipts everywhere for the twelve (12) month period
   ended June 30, 1987, are twelve million dollars ($12,000,000), and receipts
   subject to District gross receipts tax under § 3501 are one million dollars
   ($1,000,000). District personal property tax paid for the 1988 tax year was
   three thousand one hundred dollars ($3,100). The amount of the credit allowed
   on monthly gross return due November 20, 1987 shall be one thousand nine
   hundred thirty-eight dollars ($1,938), computed as follows:
   
   
   
    (1)
   
   (2)
   
   
   
   (3)
   
   
   
   (4)
   
   
   
   $2,325
   
   $1,000,000
   
   X
   
   $1,000,000
   
   =
   
   $1,938
   
   
   
   
   
   $12,000,000
   
   
   
   $100,000
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   (2)	Same facts as example (1) except that receipts subject to District gross
   receipts tax was one million four hundred thousand dollars ($1,400,000). The
   allowable credit is two thousand three hundred twenty-five dollars ($2,325),
   computed as follows because that amount is the lesser of:
   
   
   
   (a)	The result of the computation below; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Gross receipts taxes paid for the twelve (12) months preceding July 1,
   1987.
   
   
   
   (1)
   
   
   
   (2)
   
   
   
   (3)
   
   
   
   (4)
   
   
   
   $2,325
   
   X
   
   $1,400,000
   
   X
   
   $1,000,000
   
   =
   
   $2,713
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   $12,000,000
   
   
   
   $100,000

   3504.3. As used in § 3504.2, the term &#8220;value of personal
   property&#8221; shall mean, for both the numerator and denominator of the
   fraction, that amount carried on the taxpayer&#8217;s balance sheet at
   original cost for the personal property shown in the fraction.

   3504.4. The numerator and denominator of Column (3) property values shall
   include all property subject to the personal property tax under the provisions
   of the Personal Property Tax Amendment Act of 1986, effective February 28,
   1987 (D.C. Law 6-212; D.C. Code § 47-1521 et seq.) without regard for any
   exemption from the tax.

   3504.5. The credit provided in this section shall reduce the tax due each
   month under this section until the credit, in the aggregate, has been
   exhausted.
