CONFIDENTIALITY (ยง 24-2405)

2405.1. All callers so requesting shall be given an identifying number to
   preserve the caller&#8217;s anonymity. Although every effort will be
   undertaken to maintain the caller&#8217;s confidentiality, complete anonymity
   cannot be absolutely guaranteed. Further confidential information and
   identification will be necessary in the event that the caller later becomes
   entitled to a reward.
