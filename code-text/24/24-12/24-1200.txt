   Columbia, shall review the petition to determine whether this section shall be
   amended to include the historic district and shall take the appropriate
   action.

   1200.3. The pavement materials for new sidewalk installation on a street zoned
   R or SP in an historic district shall be brick and sand.

   1200.4. The pavement material for new sidewalk installation on a street zoned

   1200.5. The abutting property owners shall be assessed the cost of new
   sidewalk installation performed pursuant to §§1200.3 and 1200.4 in the
   manner specified by D.C. Code §7-601 et seq. (1981).

   1200.6. If the area to be repaired on a sidewalk on a street zoned R or SP in
   an historic district is twenty feet (20 ft.) or more in length and the full
   width of the sidewalk, the Department shall repair the sidewalk with brick on
   sand.

   1200.7. If the area to be repaired on a sidewalk on a street zoned R or SP in
   an historic district is less than twenty feet (20 ft.) and the full width of

   materials.

   1200.8. If the area to be repaired on a sidewalk on a street zoned for
   commercial purposes in an historic district is twenty feet (20 ft.) or more in
   length and the full width of the sidewalk, the Department shall give notice to
   the abutting property owner(s) that the Department intends to repair the

   property owner agrees to share in the cost of repairing the sidewalk with
   brick on concrete.

   1200.10. The Department shall review the request(s) and shall finally
   determine which paving material shall be used based on the appropriateness,
   availability, and cost of the pavement materials, and based on any other
   pertinent factors. This determination shall be made within thirty (30) days of
   the date of receipt of the request.

   1200.11. If the area to be repaired on a sidewalk on a street zoned for

   and the full width of the sidewalk, the Department shall repair the sidewalk
   with in-kind paving materials.

   1200.12. For streets located in an historic district which have a mix of

   the Director shall determine, based on the primary character of the streets,
   which subsection of this section most appropriately applies to the streets.

   Renewal Area.
