OCCUPANCY OF PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY WITH STAND-ALONE CONDUIT, PIPES, AERIAL WIRE,
OR SURFACE STRUCTURES HOUSING TRANSMISSION FACILITIES (§ 24-3302)

3302.1. Effective April 1, 2000, no person shall occupy the public
   right-of-way below ground with stand-alone conduit or pipe, above ground with
   aerial lines, or on the surface with any structure housing transmission
   facilities (other than public pay telephones) or be eligible to obtain public
   space permits authorizing or needed for the installation of such facilities,
   unless a Public Right-of-Way Occupancy Permit is issued by the Director.

   3302.2. Any person who, as of the effective date of this section, has
   installations for which a Public Right-of-Way Occupancy Permit is required
   under this section shall be issued a permit on March 31, 2000.

   3302.3. Persons seeking a Public Right-of-Way Occupancy Permit under this
   section shall submit an application on the form provided by the Department and
   shall set forth the following information:
   
   
   
   (a)	A detailed description of the existing or proposed stand-alone conduit,
   pipe, aerial wire, or surface structures housing transmission facilities;
   
   
   
   (b)	The existing or proposed number of linear feet of stand-alone conduit,
   pipe, aerial wire, or surface structures housing transmission facilities and
   the existing or proposed location thereof; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Such other information as may be required by the Director.

   3302.4. All persons holding Public Right-of-Way Occupancy Permits issued
   pursuant to this section shall pay a rental fee as described herein. Except,
   however, a Public Right-of-Way Occupancy Permittee regulated by the Office of
   Cable Television and Telecommunications for the provision of cable or video
   services shall be exempt from the rental fee requirement for its stand-alone
   conduit, pipe, aerial wire, or surface structures housing transmission
   facilities related to its cable or video franchise.

   3302.5. Persons described in 3302.2 shall make the first rental payment no
   later than July 1, 2000 for the period covering April 1, 2000 through June 30,
   2000 and shall provide the information required in section 3302.4 no later
   than June 15, 2000. Failure to comply with either of these requirements shall
   result in the suspension or revocation of the permit in accordance with
   subsection 3304.3.

   3302.6. If a Public Right-of-Way Occupancy Permittee described in subsection
   3302.2 cannot ascertain the actual number of linear feet or square feet it
   occupied as of April 1, 2000, it shall provide the Director with its good
   faith estimate and describe the method by which the estimate was made. Rental
   payments required under this section for these existing installations shall be
   based upon this estimate unless the Director provides written notification
   that a different estimate shall be used.

   3302.7. The Director may revoke, in accordance with subsection 3304.4, a
   Public Right-of-Way Occupancy Permit if the permit holder fails to pay the
   amount of the rental fee when and as due.

   3302.8. All Public Right-of-Way Occupancy Permittees with stand-alone conduits
   or pipes in the public right-of-way below the surface thereof shall pay a
   rental fee of $ 1.06 per linear foot of public right-of-way occupied.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Public Right-of-Way Occupancy Permittee shall
   not be obliged to pay a rental fee for those stand-alone conduits or pipes
   that the Department can reasonably determine were abandoned prior to March 31,
   2000.

   3302.9. All Permittees with aerial wires in the public right-of-way above the
   surface thereof shall pay a rental fee of $ 1.59 per linear foot of aerial
   space above the public right-of-way occupied.

   3302.10. All Permittees with structures housing transmission facilities in the
   public right- of-way on the surface of the right-of-way shall pay a rental fee
   of $1.59 per square foot of surface public right-of-way occupied.

   3302.11. Except as provided in subsection 3302.5, rent shall be paid in
   advance on a quarterly basis. Rental payments shall be due on April 1, July 1,
   October 1, and the first business day of January of each year. The rent due
   shall equal the amount of public space occupied by the Public Right-of-Way
   Occupancy Permittee as of the rental payment due date multiplied by the
   applicable rate.

   3302.12. Each payment shall be accompanied by a certified statement from an
   authorized officer of the Public Right-of-Way Occupancy Permittee or a duly
   authorized representative stating that the amount of the payment is true and
   correct to the best of the officer&#8217;s or representative&#8217;s knowledge
   and belief after due inquiry.

   3302.13. Fees may be paid by cash, check or credit card. Checks shall be made
   payable to the D.C. Treasurer. Payments by credit cards shall include the
   requisite handling charge that is assessed by the credit card company. Late
   payments shall incur interest beginning 5 days after the date due at the rate
   of ten (10%) percent per annum, compounded daily. This provision does not
   limit the Director&#8217;s right to revoke a permit for late payment, pursuant
   to subsection 3302.7.

   3302.14. On April 1, July 1, October 1, and the first business day of January
   of each year, each Public Right-of-Way Occupancy Permittee shall submit a
   quarterly report on the past quarter’s financial performance to inform the
   Department of its on-going activities related to the occupancy of the public
   rights-of-way and to provide an ongoing inventory of the Permittee&#8217;s
   stand-alone conduits, pipes, aerial lines, and the surface housing of
   transmission facilities occupying the public rights-of-way.

   3302.15. The District reserves the right to audit the accuracy of the reports
   submitted by Public Right-of-Way Occupancy Permittees hereunder. Upon
   reasonable notice, Public Right-of-Way Occupancy Permittee shall allow the
   District access to all reports and records pertinent to the determination of
   the number of linear or square feet of public rights-of-way occupied by
   Permittee. The District shall also have the right to inspect Public
   Right-of-Way Occupancy Permittee&#8217;s facilities to investigate the
   accuracy of reports and of rental payments based thereon. If, as a result of
   such audit and inspection, the District determines that any Public
   Right-of-Way Occupancy Permittee has under-counted the number of linear or
   square feet of public rights-of-way occupied by Permittee or has underpaid the
   rental fees due hereunder for any reason, the District shall make demand upon
   the Permittee for the underpaid amounts. Public Right-of-Way Occupancy
   Permittee shall pay such amounts within fifteen (15) days of such demand. If
   the underpayment exceeds five percent (5%) of Public Right-of-Way Occupancy
   Permittee&#8217;s annual payment hereunder, Permittee shall, upon demand from
   District, pay to the District all costs reasonably incurred in such audit and
   inspection.

   3302.16. Any overpayment to the District shall be credited against the Public
   Right-of-Way Occupancy Permittee&#8217;s next rental payment.
