                                  DC REGULATIONS

AGE AND VISION REQUIREMENTS (§ 24-2310)

2310.1. To establish age as required by § 203(a)(1) of the Act, a valid
   driver&#8217;s license, birth certificate, or other government document
   requiring a date of birth under penalty of perjury shall be acceptable.

   2310.2. A valid driver&#8217;s license from any state, territory, or
   possession, or an international driver&#8217;s license or one issued by the
   military shall, in the case of a new resident, be treated the same as if it
   had been issued by the District.

   2310.3. When a District permit is obtained, the applicant shall communicate
   the permit number to the Firearms Registration Section.

   2310.4. To establish that the applicant complies with the  vision requirements
   of § 203(a)(11) of the Act, the applicant shall certify in writing, on a form
   provided by the Firearms Registration Section, that the applicant’s vision
   is not impaired more than 20/200 visual acuity in the better eye and for whom
   vision cannot be improved to better than 20/200, or who has loss of vision due
   wholly or in part to impairment of field of vision or to other factors which
   affect the usefulness of vision to a like degree.

   2310.5. If the Firearms Registration Section determines there are reasonable
   grounds to believe that the certification provided in § 2310.4 is not
   accurate, the Firearms Registration Section may require the applicant to
   obtain a certification from a licensed optometrist that the applicant meets
   the vision requirement of § 203(a)(11) of the Act.
