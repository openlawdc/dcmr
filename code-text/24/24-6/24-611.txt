611.1 	Any individual desiring a parking facility attendant’s license shall
   correctly provide, upon a form prescribed by the Director, the following
   information:
   
   (a) 	The applicant’s full name and address;
   
   (b) 	The applicant’s color of hair and eyes;
   
   (c) 	The applicant’s date of birth and sex;
   
   (d) 	The number and date of expiration of the applicant’s motor vehicle
   operator’s license; and
   
   (e) 	A statement of whether the applicant has ever been convicted of a felony
   or misdemeanor.
   
   611.2 	Each applicant shall include with his or her application a copy of the
   applicant’s police record from the jurisdiction in which he or she resides
   on the date of the application, which is certified by the chief of police of
   that jurisdiction.
   
   611.3 	On receipt of the application, the Director shall issue to the
   applicant a receipt, certifying that the application has been received.
   
   611.4 	Upon the approval of the application by the Director, the Director
   shall issue to the applicant a license for two (2) years.
   
   611.5 	When an applicant for a parking attendant’s license has submitted his
   or her application and has been issued the receipt by the Director, as
   provided for in this section, that receipt shall have the full force and
   effect of a license until the Director either issues the license or denies the
   application. The Director may require additional information or documentation
   necessary to determine the applicant’s fitness to receive a license and may
   deny a license to an applicant who fails to provide the required information
   or supporting documentation.

   611.6. In addition to those grounds otherwise outlined by law or regulation,
   the Director shall have the authority to deny, revoke, or suspend the license
   if the applicant or licensee:
   
   (a)	Fails to meet or maintain the qualifications for licensure as outlined in
   this chapter; or
   
   (b) 	If the Director finds that the applicant or licensee shows a disregard
   for safety, property, welfare of an individual, or the general public, or is
   otherwise unfit to work as a parking lot facility attendant.
