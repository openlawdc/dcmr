                                  DC REGULATIONS

INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES (ยง 24-2706)

2706.1. Nothing in these rules shall be interpreted as prohibiting any MPD
   member, in the course of his or her duties, from visiting any place, and
   attending any event that is open to the public, or reviewing information that
   is in the public domain, on the same terms and conditions as members of the
   public, so long as the member has a legitimate law enforcement objective;
   provided, that any undercover activities shall be authorized as required by
   sections 2704 and 2705. When conducting investigations under these rules, MPD
   may use any lawful investigative technique. All requirements for the use of
   such methods under the Constitution, applicable statutes, and MPD regulations
   or policies must be observed.

   2706.2. Where the conduct of an investigation presents a choice between uses
   of more or less intrusive methods, MPD investigators shall consider whether
   the information could be obtained in a timely and effective way by the less
   intrusive means.

   2706.3. Undercover officers and informants shall not:
   
   
   
   (a)	participate in unlawful acts or threats of violence; using unlawful
   techniques to obtain information;
   
   
   
   (b)	initiate, propose, approve, direct, or suggest unlawful acts or a plan to
   commit unlawful acts;
   
   
   
   (c)	be present during criminal activity or remain present during unanticipated
   criminal activity, unless it has been determined in advance by an Intelligence
   Unit official to be necessary for the investigation;
   
   
   
   (d)	engage in any conduct the purpose of which is to disrupt, prevent, or
   hinder the lawful exercise of First Amendment activities;
   
   
   
   (e)	attend meetings or engage in other activities for the purpose of obtaining
   legally privileged information, such as attorney-client communications or
   physician- patient communications; and
   
   
   
   (f)	record or maintain a record concerning persons or organizations who are
   not a target of the investigation or preliminary inquiry, unless the
   information is material to the investigation or preliminary inquiry, or the
   information would itself justify an investigation or preliminary inquiry under
   these rules.
