   &#8220;Intelligence Section&#8221; means the Intelligence Section,

   when there is reasonable suspicion to believe that criminal activity or
   activities are being planned or conducted under the guise of First Amendment
   activities.
   
   
   
   &#8220;Legitimate law enforcement objective&#8221; means the detection,
   investigation, deterrence, or prevention of crime, or the apprehension and
   prosecution of a suspected criminal; provided, that a person shall not be
   considered to be pursuing a legitimate law enforcement objective if the person
   is acting based upon the race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, lawful
   political affiliation or activity, or lawful news-gathering activity of an
   individual or group.
   
   
   
   &#8220;Mail cover&#8221; means the inspection and review of the outside of
   envelopes of posted mail and other delivered items.

   arising from an allegation of criminal activity under the guise of First

   &#8220;Reasonable suspicion&#8221; means a belief based on articulable facts
   and circumstances indicating a past, current, or impending violation of law.
   The reasonable suspicion standard is lower than the standard of probable
   cause; however, a mere hunch is insufficient as a basis for reasonable
   suspicion. A suspicion that is based upon the race, ethnicity, religion,
   national origin, lawful political affiliation or activity, or lawful
   news-gathering activity of an individual or group is not a reasonable
   suspicion.
