                                  DC REGULATIONS

STATEMENT OF POLICY (ยง 24-2701)

2701.1. The District of Columbia is often the site of demonstrations and MPD
   must be prepared to deal with those groups and individuals that come not to
   exercise their Constitutional rights, but rather to engage in criminal acts
   under the guise of First Amendment activities.

   2701.2. The rules of this chapter are intended to assure that MPD officers
   will protect the guarantees of the Constitution while at the same time perform
   their duties with certainty, confidence and effectiveness. These rules are
   binding on all MPD members who are engaged in the investigation of criminal
   activity as they pertain to First Amendment activities.

   2701.3. It is MPD policy that investigations involving any criminal activity
   conform to the guarantees of the Constitution and that care is exercised in
   the conduct of those investigations so as to protect constitutional rights,
   and that matters investigated are confined to those supported by a legitimate
   law enforcement purpose.
