   3208.3. The bolts shall pass through the frame and shall be securely held in
   place by nuts and washers on the inside.

   3208.4. The ends of the bolts shall be upset to prevent loosening or removal
   of the nuts.

   3208.5. Where the nature of the solid metal frame construction is such that
   the method described in §§3208.2 through 3208.4 cannot be followed, it shall
   be permissible to drill and tap the metal frame to a depth of at least
   three-eighth inch (3/8 in.), and to install the anchor with at least two (2)

   3208.8. All screws used in the installation of anchors on metal frame
   construction shall have the threads terminate far enough from the screw head
   to prevent weakening due to undercutting.
