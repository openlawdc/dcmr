MAINTENANCE OF CLEAR PASSAGEWAY (ยง 24-204)

204.1. Each applicant for a permit to use surface space shall demonstrate to
   the satisfaction of the Committee that the use to be made of the space will
   include provisions for the maintenance of a clear, unobstructed passageway not
   less than ten feet (10 ft.) in width at all points, entirely across the
   frontage of the property occupied by the applicant, parallel to the line of
   the street, and generally in the line of pedestrian traffic.

   204.2. If the Committee finds that usually, or at certain periods during the
   day or evening, the flow of pedestrian traffic at a location is sufficiently
   light to permit a passageway narrower than ten feet (10 ft.), a passageway as
   narrow as six feet (6 ft.) may be approved by the Committee. Approval for the
   narrower passageway may be given either at all times when the use of surface
   space is permitted, or for certain specified periods during the time when the
   use is permitted.

   204.3. The width of the passageway or passageways approved by the Committee
   shall be indicated on the permit issued for the use of the surface space, and
   the space itself shall be marked to define the width of the passageways.

   204.4. The markings of passageways shall be by one (1) or more painted white
   lines, each not less than four inches (4 in.) wide; or by other markings as
   may be required, extending across the total surface space the permittee is
   authorized to use.

   204.5. The markings of passageways shall be done by the permittee in
   accordance with the directions of the Director.
