                                  DC REGULATIONS

ALTERATION, REPAIR, AND REPLACEMENT OF VAULTS (§ 24-218)

218.1. A vault may be altered, repaired, or replaced only under permit
   obtained and issued in accordance with applicable provisions of this chapter.

   218.2. Where a new building is to be erected on property adjoining an existing
   vault, and the vault space is to be used immediately or shortly for the
   construction of a new vault, the existing vault may be sealed by construction
   of a solid masonry wall separating it from the private property.

   218.3. In the case of a replacement vault under § 218.2, the vault agreement
   and insurance shall remain in effect, and full responsibility shall rest on
   the owner. No rent, however, shall be charged for the space until the new
   vault is constructed, subject to the provisions of §§ 218.4 and 218.5.

   218.4. If construction on the new building has not been started within six (6)
   months following the construction of the sealing wall, rent shall again be
   charged for the space occupied by the sealed vault at the previous rate until
   construction is started.

   218.5. If construction is suspended after starting, and remains suspended for
   six (6) consecutive months, rent shall be charged as provided in § 218.4
   during the remainder of the period of suspended construction.
