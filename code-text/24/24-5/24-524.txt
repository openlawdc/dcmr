VENDING LOCATIONS[COLON] GENERAL (§ 24-524)

524.1. The DDOT Director shall approve Vending Locations that meet the
   standards for locations on streets, sidewalks, and other public spaces where
   vending may be permitted pursuant to §§ 525, 532, 533 and 535. Proposed
   sidewalk Vending Locations may be submitted to the DDOT Director by DCRA or as
   part of a vendor’s Vending Site Permit application.

   524.2. The DDOT Director may eliminate a previously designated Vending
   Location if:
   
   
   
   (a)	The DDOT Director determines that the designated Vending Location is 	no
   longer in compliance with District law or regulations;
   
   
   
   (b)	The DDOT Director determines that the operation of a vending business at
   	the location constitutes a threat to the public safety; or
   
   
   
   (c)	The DDOT Director determines that the interests of the District or the
   	public would be better served if the public space occupied by the Vending
   	Location is designated for another use or for open space.

   524.3. The DDOT Director may eliminate a Vending Location assigned to a vendor
   under § 510.1; provided, that the vendor shall have the opportunity, within
   thirty (30) days of the elimination of the Vending Location, to identify a
   location that the vendor believes meets the criteria under §§ 524-528;
   provided further, that if the identified location is approved by the DDOT
   Director, the vendor shall be issued a new Vending Site Permit for the new
   Vending Location by the DCRA Director at no cost to the vendor.

   524.4. The DDOT Director shall re-evaluate a Vending Location when a vendor
   issued a Vending Site Permit under § 510.1(c) ceases to vend at that Vending
   Location. In its re-evaluation, the DDOT Director shall utilize the provisions
   of § 524.2.
