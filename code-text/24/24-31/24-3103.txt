SIDE CLEARANCES (ยง 24-3103)

3103.1. The minimum side clearances from the center of tangent standard gauge
   railroad tracks that are used or proposed to be used for operating freight
   cars shall be as prescribed in this section, except as otherwise prescribed in
   this chapter.

   3103.2. On all structures and obstructions above the top of a rail, except
   those specifically mentioned, the side clearances shall be not less than eight
   feet by six inches (8 ft. x 6 in.).

   3103.3. To further reduce occupational hazards, posts, pipes, warning signs,
   and similar obstructions shall have a side clearance of ten feet (10 ft.),
   where practicable.

   3103.4. Platforms that are eight inches (8 in.) or less above the top of a
   rail shall have a side clearance of not less than four feet by eight inches (4
   ft. x 8 in.).

   3103.5. Platforms that are more than eight inches (8 in.), but not more than
   four feet (4 ft.) above the top of the rail, may have a side clearance of not
   less than five feet by seven inches (5 ft. x 7 in.); Provided, that where
   these platforms are used for loading or unloading freight cars, a side
   clearance of not less than eight feet by six inches (8 ft. x 6 in.) is
   maintained on the opposite side of the track to any fixed structure or that
   the track center to an adjacent track is not less than fourteen feet (14 ft.).

   3103.6. Where side clearances are less than eight feet by six inches (8 ft. x
   6 in.), as authorized by this rule, warning signs directing attention to the
   reduced clearances shall be erected at suitable locations, except where the
   platform is used principally in loading and unloading passenger cars.

   3103.7. Platforms previously constructed with clearances less than are
   prescribed in this chapter may be extended with lesser clearances, unless the
   extension is connected to the reconstruction of the original platform.

   3103.8. Through bridges supporting tracks, tunnels, water columns, and oil
   columns shall be not less than eight feet (8 ft.) from the center line of the
   track.

   3103.9. Clearances for through bridges supporting tracks, water barrel
   platforms and refuge platforms on bridges and trestles not provided with
   walkways, hand rails, water barrels, water columns, oil columns, block
   signals, when all or portions thereof are four feet (4 ft.) or less above the
   top of the rail may be decreased to the extent defined by a line extending
   diagonally upward from a point level with the top of the rail and five foot (5
   ft.) lateral distance from the center line of the track to a point four feet
   (4 ft.) above the top of the rail and an eight foot (8 ft.) lateral distance
   from the center line of the track; Provided, that the minimum clearance for
   hand rails and water barrels on bridges with walkways shall be seven feet by
   nine inches (7 ft. x 9 in.).

   3103.10. Switch boxes, switch-operating mechanisms, and accessories necessary
   for the control and operation of signals, and interlockers projecting four
   inches (4 in.) or less above the top of a rail, shall have a side clearance of
   not less than three feet (3 ft.).

   3103.11. The center spindle of signal and switch stands three feet (3 ft.) or
   less above the top of the rail, and located between tracks where not practical
   to provide clearance otherwise prescribed in this chapter, shall be not less
   than six feet (6 ft.) from the center line of the track.

   3103.12. Side clearances, on sidings only, at entrances to and inside
   warehouses and industrial buildings shall be not less than eight feet (8 ft.)
   from the center line of the track; Provided, that this rule shall not
   supersede or affect the clearances in ยง3103.3.

   3103.13. All minimum side clearances prescribed in this section are for
   tangent tracks. Structures adjacent to curve tracks shall have an additional
   minimum side clearance compensating for the curvature.
