   circumstances, an adjustable price.

   specific and stated circumstances.

   allow any adjustment in price on the basis of a contractor&#8217;s cost
   experience during contract performance.

   4324.4. A firm-fixed-price contract shall be used for acquiring commercial
   products or services and shall be based on detailed specifications, definitive
   statements of work and when the CCO anticipates there will be adequate price
   competition.
