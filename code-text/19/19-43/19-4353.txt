DESIGN WITHIN FUNDING LIMITATION (ยง 19-4353)

4353.1. The Library may require the architect-engineer contractor to design
   the project so that construction will not exceed a contractually specified
   dollar limit. The amount of the construction funding shall be established
   during negotiations between the firm and the CCO.

   4353.2. In negotiating the funding limitation amount, the CCO shall make
   available to the firm the information upon which the Library has based its
   initial construction estimate and subsequently acquired information that may
   affect the construction costs.

   4353.3. If the price of construction proposed in response to a Library
   solicitation exceeds the construction specified dollar funding limit in the
   architect-engineer contract, the firm shall be solely responsible for
   redesigning the project within the funding limitation.

   4353.4. Any redesign services required by Section 4354 shall be performed at
   no increase in price of the architect-engineer (A/E) contract, unless the cost
   of proposed construction is based on circumstances beyond the A/E firm&#8217;s
   reasonable control.

   4353.5. If an architect-engineer firm&#8217;s design fails to meet the
   contractual limitation on construction cost and the CCO determines that the
   firm should not redesign the project, the CCO shall place a written statement
   of the reasons for that determination in the contract file.
