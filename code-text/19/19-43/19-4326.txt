                                  DC REGULATIONS

COST-REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS (ยง 19-4326)

4326.1. The CCO shall use a cost-reimbursement contract only when the
   requirement cannot be fully defined and costs cannot be estimated with
   sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.

   4326.2. The CCO shall justify the use of a cost-reimbursement contract in
   writing.

   4326.3. When a cost-reimbursement contract is utilized, the CCO shall take
   steps to minimize cost over-runs.

   4326.4. Each cost-reimbursement contract shall include a specified ceiling
   that a contractor shall not exceed.

   4326.5. The CCO may use a cost-reimbursement contract only when each of the
   following circumstances applies:
   
   
   
   (a)	The contractor&#8217;s accounting system is adequate for determining costs
   applicable to the contract; and
   
   
   
   (b)	There is reasonable assurance that efficient methods of surveillance and
   effective cost controls by the Library will be used.

   4326.6. The CCO shall incorporate the appropriate clauses in each solicitation
   and contract when a cost-reimbursement type contract is utilized.

   4326.7. The CCO shall not use a cost-plus-incentive fee or cost-plus-award fee
   type contract.

   4326.8. The CCO may use a cost-sharing contract when the contractor agrees to
   absorb an equal portion of the costs and no fee.

   4326.9. The CCO may use a cost reimbursement contract which allows for a
   contractor to be reimbursed based on actual costs only and no fee.

   4326.10. The CCO may use a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract that provides for
   payment to the contractor of a negotiated fee in a fixed amount at the
   inception of the contract. The fixed fee does not vary with actual costs.

   4326.11. A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract may be in either a completion form or
   level-of-effort form. The completion form shall be the preferred form. A
   completion form requires the contractor to provide a concrete end product
   based on a definite goal or target specified in the statement of work. The
   level-of-effort form calls for the contractor&#8217;s services (time and
   effort) rather than a concrete end product. The level-of-effort form
   reimburses the contractor&#8217;s incurred costs (within a specified ceiling)
   and is paid a fixed fee based on satisfactory performance.
