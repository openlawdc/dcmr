                                  DC REGULATIONS

PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT SECURITY (ยง 19-4360)

4360.1. The CCO shall require a contractor to furnish performance and payment
   bonds or other security on any construction contract when the Library&#8217;s
   independent cost estimate exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).
   Performance or payment bonds (or other securities) shall be submitted by the
   deadline stated in the solicitation.

   4360.2. The CCO may require a contractor to furnish a payment or performance
   bond or other security for any construction or non-construction contract,
   regardless of amount, when the CCO determines that the security is necessary
   to protect the Library&#8217;s interests.

   4360.3. The amount of the performance security shall be one hundred percent
   (100%) of the original contract price, unless the CCO determines that a lesser
   amount or percentage would be adequate to protect the Library. The bidder or
   offeror shall furnish the security to the CCO as prescribed by this section.

   4360.4. The CCO shall require additional performance security when a contract
   price is increased. The increase in performance security shall equal one
   hundred percent (100%) of the increase in the contract price, unless the CCO
   determines that a lesser amount or percentage is adequate to protect the
   Library&#8217;s interests.

   4360.5. When a contract is modified pursuant to the changes clause, the CCO
   may require additional performance security or payment security from the
   contractor in an amount determined reasonable by the CCO. If no performance or
   payment security was required, the CCO may require performance or payment
   security in an amount the CCO determines reasonable.

   4360.6. The payment security shall be in an amount of not less than fifty
   percent (50%) of the total amount of the contract price.

   4360.7. When a contract price is increased, the Library may require additional
   payment security in an amount adequate to protect suppliers of labor material.
   However, in no event shall the amount of payment security fall below fifty
   percent (50%) of the increased contract price.

   4360.8. When performance or payment security is required, the solicitation
   shall contain the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	A statement that security is required;
   
   
   
   (b)	The amount of the security expressed as a fixed amount or percentage of
   the contract price; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The deadline for submitting the required security.
