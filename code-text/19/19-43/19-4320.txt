SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT (ยง 19-4320)

4320.1. The CCO shall take reasonable steps to avoid using sole source
   procurement except in circumstances when it is both necessary and in the best
   interest of the Library.

   4320.2. [RESERVED]

   4320.3. The CCO shall determine the format used to request a proposal for a
   sole source procurement.

   4320.4. The CCO shall take action, whenever possible, to avoid the need to
   continue to procure the same supply, service or construction without
   competition.

   4320.5. The CCO shall not award a contract on a sole source basis when the
   justification is based on lack of sufficient time to complete the competitive
   process through the competitive sealed bidding or competitive sealed proposal
   method of procurement, unless a legitimate emergency, as defined Section 4321
   exists.

   4320.6. The CCO shall ensure that each sole source procurement is reviewed and
   approved by the Library&#8217;s Procurement Executive in accordance with
   Section 4320.7.

   4320.7. When a sole source procurement is proposed, the CCO shall prepare a
   written determination and findings (D&#038;F) that justifies the sole source
   procurement. The Library&#8217;s Procurement Executive shall approve all
   D&#038;Fs in excess of fifty thousand ($50,000) before issuance of a
   solicitation.

   4320.8. Each D&#038;F shall include the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Designation that the requirement is a sole source D&#038;F;
   
   
   
   (b)	A description of the requirement, including the estimated cost;
   
   
   
   (c)	A description of the factors that qualify the requirement as a sole source
   procurement such that the requirement is available from one source or only one
   supplier with unique capabilities;
   
   
   
   (d)	A discussion of the proposed contractor&#8217;s unique qualifications that
   qualify the proposed contractor for a sole source award;
   
   
   
   (e)	A statement that the anticipated costs to the Library will be fair and
   reasonable; and
   
   
   
   (f)	Any other relevant facts to support the use of a sole source procurement.

   4320.10. The CCO shall ensure that each sole source contract contains all of
   the required clauses, provisions, representations and certifications.
