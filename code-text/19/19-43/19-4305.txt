   4305.5. For each procurement in an amount over three thousand dollars ($3,000)
   but less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) the CCO shall solicit
   quotations from at least three (3) sources to promote competition to the

   supplies or services.

   4305.13. The CCO shall not use simplified procurement procedures when the

   contract, a District or Federal Supply Schedule or other required source of
   supply unless the CCO justifies the rationale in writing.

   4305.14. The CCO shall ensure that procurements are not split, parceled,
   divided or purchased over a period of time to circumvent the dollar
   limitations for use of simplified procurement procedures.

   4305.15. The CCO shall use the simplified procurement procedure that is most
   suitable, economical and efficient based on the circumstances of each
