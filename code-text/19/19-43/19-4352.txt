LIABILITY FOR DESIGN ERRORS OR DEFICIENCIES (ยง 19-4352)

4352.1. The architect-engineer firm shall be responsible for the professional
   quality, technical accuracy, and coordination of all services required under

   errors or deficiencies in designs furnished under its contract.

   4352.2. When modification of a construction contract is required because of an
   error or deficiency in the services provided under an architect-engineer
   contract, the CCO shall determine the extent to which the architect-engineer
   may be liable.

   4352.3. If the CCO determines that the firm is liable, and the recoverable
   cost will exceed the administrative cost involved or collection is otherwise
   in the best interests of the Library, the CCO shall initiate procedures to
   collect the amount due.

   4352.4. The CCO shall prepare a written statement of the reasons for the
   decision whether or not to recover costs from the firm and place in the
   contract file.
