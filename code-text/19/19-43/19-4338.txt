PRICING CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS (ยง 19-4338)

4338.1. The CCO shall use firm-fixed-price contracts to procure construction.

   4338.2. A contract may be priced on a lump-sum basis (when a lump sum is paid
   for the total work or defined parts of the work), on a unit-price basis (when
   a unit price is paid for a specified quantity of work units), or a combination
   of both methods.

   4338.3. The CCO shall use lump-sum pricing in preference to unit pricing
   except when any one (1) of the following circumstances exist:
   
   
   
   (a)	Large quantities of work (such as excavation, grading, paving, building
   outside utilities, or site preparation) are involved which cannot be estimated
   with sufficient confidence to permit a lump-sum offer without a substantial
   contingency;
   
   
   
   (b)	Estimated quantities of work required may change significantly during
   construction; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Bidders would have to expend unusual effort to develop adequate estimates.

   4338.4. The CCO may not use fixed-price contracts with economic price
   adjustments when an economic price adjustment provision would preclude a
   significant number of firms from submitting bids or would result in bidders
   including unwarranted contingencies in proposed prices.
