DESIGN-BUILD PROCEDURES (ยง 19-4340)

4340	If the CCO uses a design-build process, two-phase design-build selection
   procedures shall be utilized.

   4340.1. The CCO shall only use the two-phase design-build selection procedures
   when three or more offers are anticipated.

   4340.2. The CCO may use one solicitation covering both phases, or the CCO may
   issue two solicitations in sequence.

   4340.3. The CCO shall issue a solicitation utilizing the competitive sealed
   proposals method of procurement. The solicitation shall state the maximum
   number of offerors that will be selected to submit phase-two proposals.

   4340.4. The maximum number specified shall not exceed five unless the CCO
   determines, for that particular solicitation, that a number greater than five
   is in the Library&#8217;s interest and is consistent with the purposes and
   objectives of two-phase design-build contracting.

   4340.5. After evaluating phase-one proposals, the CCO shall select the most
   highly qualified offerors, not to exceed the maximum number specified in the
   solicitation in accordance with Section 4340.4, and request that only those
   offerors submit phase-two proposals.
