NONCOMPLIANCE WITH BID OR PROPOSAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (ยง 19-4359)

4359.1. If a bid or proposal fails to comply with the Security Bond
   requirements outlined in the solicitation, the CCO shall reject the bid or
   proposal. However, the CCO may accept the bid or proposal if the CCO
   determines in writing that both of the following apply:
   
   
   
   (a)	The bid or proposal meets the criteria set forth in this section; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Acceptance of he bid or proposal would be in the best interests of the
   Library.

   4359.2. If the amount of the Security Bond submitted by bidders or offerors,
   although less than that required by the solicitation for the maximum quantity
   or service, is sufficient for a quantity or service for which the bidder or
   offeror is otherwise eligible for award, the bid or proposal may be accepted.
   Any award to the bidder or offeror shall not exceed the quantity covered by
   the Security Bond.

   4359.3. If the Security Bond becomes inadequate as a result of the correction
   of a mistake, the bid or proposal may be accepted if the bidder or offeror
   agrees to increase the Security Bond to the level required for the corrected
   bid or proposal.

   4359.4. If the Security Bond is received late, and the receipt is waived in
   accordance with Subsection 4359.1 of this Section, the bid or proposal may be
   accepted.
