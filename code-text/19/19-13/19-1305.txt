DANCE HALLS AND OTHER PLACES OF ENTERTAINMENT (§ 19-1305)

1305.1. A permit to conduct dances or entertainment of any kind in a hall or
   other place may be refused by the Mayor whenever that place, from the
   character of the applicant or the nature of the surroundings, is likely to
   become the scene of disorder or other violation of law. The license may be
   revoked at any time whenever a place becomes the scene of disorder or other
   violations of law.

   1305.2. Any person protesting to action taken pursuant to § 1305.1, or the
   applicant or permittee, shall be entitled to a public hearing before the Board

   report the facts and the Board’s advice regarding the appeal to the Mayor.

   inspection and supervision by the members of the police force at all times
   when open for business.

   1305.4. No proprietor, manager, or employee of any place for which a permit is
   sought or obtained shall refuse admittance to any member of the police force
   who visits that place for the purpose of inspection or supervision, nor hinder
   or obstruct the officer in doing his or her duty. Each separate refusal or
   hindrance shall constitute a distinct offense.
