                                  DC REGULATIONS

SALARY INCREASE (ยง 19-3418)

3418.1. An employee occupying a permanent position who has not reached the
   maximum step of pay in his/her salary schedule, is entitled to the next higher
   rate of pay in the salary schedule provided:
   
   
   
   (a)	The employee has completed the required waiting period;
   
   
   
   (b)	The employee has performed at an acceptable level of competence based on
   the most recent performance rating; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The employee has not received an equivalent increase during that period.

   3418.2. Subject to the availability of funds, the Commission may grant a
   quality increase in salary equal to the next higher step in the salary
   schedule of an employee occupying a permanent position who substantially
   exceeds normal requirements in the most important functions (duties) of
   his/her job.  Not more than one quality increase may be granted to the same
   employee during any 52-week period.  Quality increases are in addition to
   within-grade step increases.  Therefore, an employee who receives a quality
   increase does not thereby begin a new waiting period to meet the time
   requirements for a next within-grade step increase.

   3418.3. The Personnel Office shall determine which employees are covered by
   the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Executive
   Director or his/her designee(s) shall approve all overtime work.

   3418.4. The Executive Director or his/her designee shall grant compensatory
   time accrual and leave to employees who are exempted from the Fair Labor
   Standards Act overtime provisions.
