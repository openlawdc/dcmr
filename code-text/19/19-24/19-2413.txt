                                  DC REGULATIONS

JUDGING (ยง 19-2413)

2413.1. All bouts will be evaluated and scored by three judges.

   2413.2. The 10-Point Must Scoring System will be the standard system of
   scoring a bout. Under the 10-Point Must Scoring System, 10 points must be
   awarded to the winner of the round and nine points or less must be awarded to
   the loser, except for a rare even round, which is scored (10-10).

   2413.3. Judges shall evaluate mixed martial arts techniques, such as effective
   striking, effective grappling, control of the fighting area, effective
   aggressiveness and defense.

   2413.4. Evaluation shall be made in the order in which the techniques appear
   in section 2413.3 above, giving the most weight in scoring to effective
   striking, effecting grappling, control of the fighting area and effective
   aggressiveness and defense.

   2413.5. Effective striking is judged by determining the total number of legal
   heavy strikes landed by a contestant.

   2413.6. Effective grappling is judged by considering the amount of successful
   executions of a legal takedown and reversals. Examples of factors to consider
   are take downs from standing position to mount position, passing the guard to
   mount position, and bottom position fighters using an active, threatening
   guard.

   2413.7. Fighting area control is judged by determining who is dictating the
   pace, location and position of the bout. Examples of factors to consider are
   countering a grappler&#8217;s attempt at takedown by remaining standing and
   legally striking; taking down an opponent to force a ground fight; creating
   threatening submission attempts; passing the guard to achieve mount; and
   creating striking opportunities.

   2413.8. Effective aggressiveness means moving forward and landing a legal
   strike.

   2413.9. Effective defense means avoiding being struck, taken down or reversed
   while countering with offensive attacks.

   2413.10. Judges shall utilize the following objective scoring criteria when
   scoring a round:
   
   
   
   (a)	A round is to be scored as a 10-10 round when both contestants appear to
   be fighting evenly and neither contestant shows clear dominance in a round;
   
   
   
   (b)	A round is to be scored as a 10-9 round when a contestant wins by a close
   margin, landing the greater number of effective legal strikes, grappling and
   other maneuvers;
   
   
   
   (c)	A round is to be scored as a 10-8 round when a contestant overwhelmingly
   dominates by striking or grappling in a round; or
   
   
   
   (d)	A round is to be scored as a 10-7 round when a contestant totally
   dominates by striking or grappling in a round.

   2413.11. Judges shall use a sliding scale and recognize the length of time the
   fighters are either standing or on the ground, as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	If the mixed martial artists spent a majority of a round on the canvas,
   then:
   
   
   
   1.	Effective grappling is weighed first; and
   
   
   
   2.	Effective striking is then weighed.
   
   
   
   (b)	If the mixed martial artists spent a majority of a round standing, then:
   
   
   
   1.	Effective striking is weighed first; and
   
   
   
   2.	Effective grappling is then weighed.
   
   
   
   (c)	If a round ends with a relatively even amount of standing and canvas
   fighting, striking and grappling are weighed equally.
