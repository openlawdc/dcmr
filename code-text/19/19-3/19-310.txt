                                  DC REGULATIONS

DISPUTES (ยง 19-310)

310.1. This section shall govern all disputes arising under or related to
   contracts awarded by the Authority to procure goods, services or construction.

   310.2. In order to make a claim under a contract, a party to the contract
   shall submit to the CCO a written assertion that the party is entitled to the
   payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of a
   contract provision, or other relief under the contract.

   310.3. If a claim on behalf of a contractor has a value of more than $ 50,000,
   the claim shall be accompanied by the certification of the contractor that the
   claim is made in good faith and that the amount or adjustment requested and
   the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of the
   contractor&#8217;s knowledge and belief.

   310.4. The CCO shall attempt to resolve all contractual disputes by mutual
   agreement after informal discussion. The CCO may agree to the use of
   alternative dispute resolution procedures, in accordance with the principles
   governing procurements by the Federal government set forth in relevant
   sections of Title 48 Code of Federal Regulations at any time that the CCO has
   authority to resolve the issue in controversy.

   310.5. If the CCO cannot resolve a claim after informal discussion, the CCO
   shall, within 60 days of receipt of the claim, issue a written decision
   granting or denying the claim, giving the CCO&#8217;s reasoning, and setting
   forth the contractor&#8217;s appeal rights. The CCO&#8217;s failure to issue a
   decision within this time shall be deemed to be a denial of the claim for the
   purpose of appealing the Authority&#8217;s final decision to the District of
   Columbia Contract Appeals Board.

   310.6. The District of Columbia Contract Appeals Board shall have exclusive
   jurisdiction to review final action of the Authority on any dispute.
