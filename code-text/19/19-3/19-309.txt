                                  DC REGULATIONS

PROTESTS (ยง 19-309)

309.1. An actual or prospective offeror or bidder whose direct economic
   interests would be affected by the award of, or the failure to award, a
   procurement, is an interested party with standing to assert a claim that the
   solicitation or award of, or the failure to award, the procurement, is
   contrary to law or these regulations by filing a written protest with the CCO.

   309.2. In order to be timely, a protest shall be filed:
   
   
   
   (a)	in the case of an alleged defect in an invitation for bids or request for
   proposals, before the time set for bid opening or for the receipt of
   proposals; or
   
   
   
   (b)	in all other cases, within seven days after the protestor knew or should
   have known of the alleged defect or other ground for protest.

   309.3. Each protest shall be signed by the protestor or the protestor&#8217;s
   authorized representative, and shall contain: the name, address and telephone
   number of the protestor; identification of the procurement activity, including
   the number of any solicitation or contract; a concise statement of the facts
   which are the basis of the protest; and a specific request for action by the
   CCO.

   309.4. The CCO shall not consider any protest that is not filed within the
   time requirements of section 309.2.

   309.5. The CCO shall issue a written decision on each timely protest within
   ten days of receipt. Failure to issue a decision within ten days shall be
   deemed to be a denial of the protest for the purpose of appealing the
   Authority&#8217;s final decision to the District of Columbia Contract Appeals
   Board.

   309.6. If the CCO determines in the CCO&#8217;s sole discretion that it is in
   the best interests of the Authority, the CCO may grant an extension of time to
   accept bids or awards, withhold award of a contract, or seek suspension of
   performance of an awarded contract, if it appears that the protest has merit.

   309.7. An interested party may appeal the CCO&#8217;s decision to the District
   of Columbia Contract Appeals Board, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
   review final action of the Authority on any protest.
