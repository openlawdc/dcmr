                                  DC REGULATIONS

SMALL PURCHASES (ยง 19-306)

306.1. The CCO may use the small purchase procedures set forth in this section
   to procure goods, services or construction if the total amount to be purchased
   does not exceed $ 100,000 in value. No procurement shall be divided for the
   purpose of meeting the dollar limitation of this section.

   306.2. The CCO may procure goods, services or construction of a value of $
   2,500 or less without obtaining competitive quotations. Action to verify price
   reasonableness in writing need be taken only if:
   
   
   
   (a)	The CCO suspects or has information to indicate that the price may not be
   reasonable; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Purchasing a supply or service for which no comparable pricing information
   is readily available.

   306.3. In order to promote competition and assure that the purchase is in the
   best interests of the Authority, the CCO shall solicit quotations from at
   least three sources for all small purchases of a value of more than $ 2,500.
   If possible, two of the sources shall be sources that were not included in the
   previous solicitation for similar items.

   306.4. For a small purchase of a value of $ 2,500 or more, the CCO may solicit
   quotations from only two sources, if the CCO determines in writing that it is
   impractical to solicit from more than two sources. In no event may this
   section be used to make a procurement based on the solicitation of a quotation
   from a single source.

   306.5. For each small purchase of a value of $ 2,500 or more, the CCO shall
   make an award based upon a written determination that the price to be paid to
   the successful bidder is fair and reasonable; the determination shall include
   the name of each business from which a quotation was solicited, the date of
   the solicitation, and the amount of the quotation.

   306.6. The CCO shall use a purchase order to make a small purchase, except
   that a blanket purchase agreement may be used to fill anticipated repetitive
   needs for goods, services or construction by establishing a charge account
   with a vendor for the purchase of such goods, services or construction over a
   stated period of time and in a stated amount, so long as the total amount to
   be purchased does not exceed $ 100,000.

   306.7. Each blanket purchase agreement shall require that the prices charged
   to the Authority shall be as low or lower than those charged to the
   supplier&#8217;s most favored customer for comparable quantities, terms and
   conditions.
