                                  DC REGULATIONS

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE (ยง 19-730)

730.1. The District of Columbia&#8217;s Department of Parks and Recreation
   herein provides guidelines and rules for the application, development and
   operation of neighborhood fenced-in, off-leash dog parks

   730.2. In October 2005, the Council of the District of Columbia unanimously
   passed legislation amending the Animal Control Act of 1979, effective October
   18, 1979 (D.C. Law 3-30; D.C. Official Code 8-1801 et seq.)(2001) which
   authorized the Mayor to create fenced-in, off-leash dog parks. The Council
   recognized that a significant and growing portion of residents needed safe
   places to recreate and exercise together with their dogs. The creation of dog
   parks in the District of Columbia requires a certain degree of flexibility,
   due to the density of buildings as well as the scarcity of District-owned
   parkland. Successful dog parks require partnerships with the community that
   enhance and protect the character of the neighborhood and accommodate changing
   needs.
