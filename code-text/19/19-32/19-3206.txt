   3206.2. In no instance shall the total fee for searching exceed ten dollars

   3206.3. When a response to a request requires services or materials for which

   the Commission may be charged, but only if the requestor has been notified of
   the cost before it is incurred.

   3206.4. Search costs, not to exceed ten dollars ($10.00) for each request, may
   be imposed even if the requested record cannot be located. No fees shall be
   charged for examination and review to determine whether the record is subject
   to disclosure.

   3206.5. Fees shall be paid in full prior to disclosure of the requested
   record.

   3206.6. Where an extensive number of documents are identified and collected in
   response to a request and the requestor has not indicated his/her willingness
   to pay fees as high as are anticipated for copies of the documents, the
   requestor shall be notified, in writing, that the documents are available for
   inspection and for subsequent copying at the established rate.

   3206.7. Remittances shall be in the form of cash, a personal check, a bank
   draft on a bank in the United States, or a postal money order, payable to the

   shall be made for services rendered.

   3206.9. Records may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge where
   the general manager determines that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the
   public interest because furnishing the information can be considered as
   primarily benefiting the general public.
