REVIEW OF DENIALS (§ 19-3207)

3207.1. Any person denied the right to inspect a record of the Commission, in
   whole or in part, may petition the Commission Board of Directors (the
   “Board”) to review the requested record to determine whether it may be
   withheld from inspection.  Such determination shall be made in writing, with a
   statement of reasons therefor, within ten days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays,
   and legal public holidays) of the submission of the petition.

   3207.2. A petition to the Board shall be in writing, and shall include a copy
   of the request, a statement of the circumstances, reasons or arguments
   advanced in support of disclosure, and a copy of any written denial.

   3207.3. If the Board denies the petition or does not make a determination
   within the time prescribed, or if the requestor is deemed to have exhausted
   his/her administrative remedies, the requestor may institute proceedings for
   injunctive or declaratory relief in the Superior Court for the District of
   Columbia.

   3207.4. If the Board decides that the requested record may not be withheld, it
   shall direct the executive director to disclose the record immediately.  If
   the executive director continues to withhold the requested record, the
   requestor may institute proceedings in the Superior Court for the District of
   Columbia to compel disclosure of the requested record.
