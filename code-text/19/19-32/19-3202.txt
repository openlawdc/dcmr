                                  DC REGULATIONS

REQUESTS FOR RECORDS (§ 19-3202)

3202.1. A request for a record of the Commission shall be made in writing and
   shall be directed to the executive director.

   3202.2. Although oral requests may be honored, a requestor may be required to
   submit in writing a request for records not customarily made available.

   3202.3. A request should clearly indicate that the subject is a D.C. Freedom
   of Information Act request.  However, any written request for records covered
   by this chapter shall be deemed to be a request for records pursuant to the
   Act whether or not the Act is mentioned in the request.

   3202.4. A request shall reasonably describe the requested record.  Where
   possible, specific information regarding dates, files, titles, file
   designation, or other identifying information, shall be supplied.

   3202.5. For purposes of this chapter, a “request” shall mean a single
   demand for any number of documents made at one time.

   3202.6. Where the information supplied by the requestor is not sufficient to
   permit the identification and location of the requested record without an
   unreasonable amount of effort, the requestor shall be contacted and asked to
   supply the necessary information. The Commission shall make every reasonable
   effort to assist in the identification and location of requested records.
