   811.3. The solicitation from sponsors and/or donation authorization process
   requires the successful completion of three basic components (1) the
   Application to Approve Donations (&#8220;AAD Form&#8221;); (2) the Legal
   Sufficiency Review; and (3) the Donation Agreement signed by all parties.

   811.4. The Board shall approve all donations, gifts, grants, or assets with a
   value of $10,000.00 or more, but may delegate its authority to accept any
   donation, gift, grant, or asset with a value of less than $10,000.00 to the
   Chief Librarian of the public library.

   811.5. The required signatures for the AAD Form if donation is under
   $10,000.00 is the Donor, General Counsel, and the Chief Librarian and/or
   designee. All signatures shall be obtained in that order.

   811.6. The required signatures for the AAD Form if the donation is $10,000.00
   and over is the Donor, General Counsel, Chief Librarian, and the President of
   the DCPL Board of Trustees. All signatures shall be obtained in that order.

   811.7. The donation may consist of financial (checks and other negotiable
   instruments), in-kind (direct payments and services), and fixed assets.

   811.8. For the purposes of this legislation, fixed assets may include
   furniture, equipment and computers.

   811.9. The Board is responsible for the managing of all donations whether in-
   kind, fixed asset and/or funds (both checks and negotiable instruments) in

   (1)	A statement of the proposed use of the donation and any conditions placed
   on its use by the donor;
   
   
   
   (2)	A statement of authority which denotes the agency&#8217;s use of the
   donation;
   
   
   
   (3)	A statement certifying that the donation is a bona fide donation and the
   donor does not expect any special treatment from the District Government as a
   result of the donation;
   
   
   
   (4)	A budget of planned expenditures for use of the donation;
   
   
   
   (5)	The donation will be used by the agency or instrumentality of the District
   government to fulfill an authorized function or duty;
   
   
   
   (6)	The donation is consistent with the agency&#8217;s plans for its programs
   and projects;
   
   
   
   (7)	The donation is directly related to, and will be expended solely for, a

   811.11. Donations may be used to fund any District Government activity for
   which appropriated funds may otherwise been obligated.

   811.12. Each applicant seeking authority from the Board of Library Trustees
   and/or Chief Librarian to solicit, accept, or use donations must obtain a
   legal sufficiency review from the Office of the General Counsel.

   811.13. The General Counsel shall provide a written memorandum to the Chief
   Librarian and/or Board of Library Trustees rendering legal sufficiency
   determination of all solicitations and donations. However, the General Counsel
   may forward a written notice, other than a memorandum, where it is determined
   that the donation request submitted is covered by a earlier review of a
   similar donation that has already received legal sufficiency approval.

   811.14. A signed donation form is required for all book donations and must be
   submitted to the Office of the General Counsel. Book donations are approved
   upon receipt and do not need to go through legal sufficiency approval pursuant
   to D.C. Official Code, Title 39-101 et.seq. (2001Ed.).

   811.15. The legal review process should be completed within fifteen (15) days
   of receipt of the application for donation.
