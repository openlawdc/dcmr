   landowner’s land or on the waters immediately adjacent to the landowner’s
   land.

   1010.3. Acquisition of title of a vessel apparently abandoned shall divest any
   other person of any interest in the vessel.

   1010.4. If a vessel has an identification number or other means of identifying

   appearing on the Harbor Master’s records.

   1010.5. The landowner shall notify the owner and the lien holder by registered
   letter to their last known addresses that, unless their ownership is claimed
   and the vessel removed within thirty (30) days, the landowner shall apply for
   title to the vessel in his or her name.

   1010.6. If the vessel’s owner or lien holder cannot be identified or address
   ascertained from the Harbor Master’s records, it is not necessary to send

   newspaper of general circulation published in the District a notice describing

   1010.8. The landowner shall state in the notice that unless the vessel is
   claimed and removed within thirty (30) days after the publication date of the
   paper, the landowner will apply for title to the vessel in his or her name.

   1010.9. At the end of the thirty-day (30) period the person desiring to
   acquire title shall apply to the Harbor Master for title to the vessel in his
   or her name on forms approved by the Harbor Master, and the landowner shall
   provide the Harbor Master the following affidavits:
   
   
   
   (a)	A statement that the vessel apparently has been abandoned for at least six
