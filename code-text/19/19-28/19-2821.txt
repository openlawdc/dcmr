                                  DC REGULATIONS

PROTESTS (§ 19-2821)

2821.1. The protest procedures shall be strictly adhered to or the protest
   will be denied.

   2821.2. Any interested party may file a written protest initially with the
   CCO.

   2821.3. The CCO shall consider all protests, whether submitted prior to an
   award or after an award.

   2821.4. Each protest filed with the CCO shall include the name and address of
   the protestor, and identify the contracting activity and the number of the
   solicitation or contract. The protest shall also contain a concise statement
   of the grounds of protest and a specific request for a ruling from the CCO.

   2821.5. The protest shall be fully supported by any facts, documents or other
   evidence to the extent feasible. The CCO may request the protestor to submit
   additional information in support of its protest.

   2821.6. When a protest is filed with the Board, an award shall not be made
   until the matter is resolved, unless the CCO first determines that:
   
   
   
   (a)	The supplies or services to be contracted for are urgently required;
   
   
   
   (b)	Delivery or performance will be unduly delayed by failure to make award
   promptly; or
   
   
   
   (c)	A prompt award will otherwise be advantageous to the Board.

   2821.7. When a protest against the making of an award is received, the award
   will be withheld pending disposition of the protest, and the contracting
   officer shall notify the offerors whose offers might become eligible for
   award, about the protest.

   2821.8. If appropriate, those offerors shall be requested, before expiration
   of the time for acceptance of their offer, to extend the time for acceptance
   to avoid the need for resolicitation.

   2821.9. In the event of failure to obtain extensions of offers, the CCO shall
   give consideration and have authority to proceed with the award.

   2821.10. Protests filed with the Board after the award shall be handled in
   accordance with Board procedures. The CCO shall not be required to suspend
   contract performance or terminate the awarded contract unless it appears
   likely that an award may be invalidated and a delay in receiving the supplies
   or services is not prejudicial to the Board’s interests.  In this event, the
   CCO shall consider seeking a mutual agreement with the contractor to suspend
   performance on a no-cost basis.

   2821.11. Each protest shall be filed in writing with the CCO in duplicate
   within seven (7) business days after the protestor knew or should have known
   of the facts and circumstances upon which the protest is based.

   2821.12. The contracting officer shall provide the CCO with the documents
   relevant to the protest within five (5) business days of receipt of the
   protest. The CCO shall issue a decision within ten (10) business days of
   receipt of the protest.

   2821.13. Each protestor may request a reconsideration of the CCO’s decision
   from the General Manager. The request for reconsideration shall be filed by
   the protestor within five (5) business days of receipt of the CCO’s
   decision.

   2821.14. The contracting officer shall prepare a report for the General
   Manager that includes all relevant documents of the protest.  The decision of
   the General Manager shall be issued twenty (20) calendar days after receipt of
   the request for reconsideration.

   2821.15. The protestor may appeal the General Manager’s decision only to the
   District of Columbia Contract Appeals Board (the “CAB”) within ten (10)
   working days after the protestor receives the determination from the General
   Manager.

   2821.16. The proceeding before the CAB shall be final, subject to judicial
   review in accordance with D.C. Code §§ 1-1189.5 and 1-1510. Any prior
   determinations by the Board (the CCO or the General Manager) shall not be
   final or conclusive or subject to judicial review.
