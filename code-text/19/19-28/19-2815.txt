PRICE ANALYSIS (ยง 19-2815)

2815.1. The contracting officer shall perform a price analysis in every
   procurement to examine and evaluate a proposed price to determine its
   reasonableness without evaluating separate cost elements and proposed profit.

   2815.2. The analysis may be performed using one or more of the following
   techniques:
   
   
   
   (a)	Comparison of price quotations received in response to the solicitation;
   
   
   
   (b)	Comparison of prior quotations and contract prices with current quotations
   for the same or similar end items;
   
   
   
   (c)	Application of rough yardsticks (such as dollars per pound, or other
   units) to highlight significant inconsistencies that warrant additional
   pricing inquiry;
   
   
   
   (d)	Comparison with competitive published price lists, published market prices
   of commodities, similar indexes, and discounts or rebate arrangements; and
   
   
   
   (e)	Comparison of proposed prices with independent Board cost estimates.

   2815.3. Price analysis shall also be used to determine the truth of a
   representation that certain items are commercial items with established
   catalog or market prices sold in substantial quantities to the general public
   and that, as a consequence, the quoted price is reasonable.
