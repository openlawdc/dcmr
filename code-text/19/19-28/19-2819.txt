INSPECTIONS (§ 19-2819)

2819.1. The Board may, in its sole discretion, enter a contractor’s or
   subcontractor’s plant or place of business in order to:
   
   
   
   (a)	Inspect or test supplies or services for acceptance by the Board based on
   the terms of the contract;
   
   
   
   (b)	Audit cost or pricing data, or audit the books and records; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Investigate in connection with an action to debar or suspend an offeror or
   contractor from consideration for award of contracts.

   2819.2. If inspections or tests are performed at the contractor’s or
   subcontractor’s plant or place of business, the inspections or tests shall
   be performed in a manner so as to not unduly delay the work.

   2819.3. No inspector or Board employee other than the contracting officer may
   change any provision of the specifications or the contract without written
   authorization of the contracting officer.

   2819.4. Inspections and tests by the Board shall not relieve the contractor of
   responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements
   discovered before acceptance.  Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for
   latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise
   provided in the contract.
