2823.1. For the purpose of this section, “an anti-competitive practice” is
   a practice among offerors or potential offerors which reduces or eliminates
   competition or restrains trade.  An anticompetitive practice may result from
   an agreement or understanding among competitors to submit collusive offers.

   the market place and may conduct studies of past procurements such as, but not
   limited to, the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	A study of the history of a supply, service, or construction item over a
   period of time sufficient to determine any significant patterns or changes;
   
   
   
   (b)	A review of similar Board contract awards over a period of time; or
   
   
   
   (c)	Consultation with outside sources of information, such as offerors who
   have competed for similar Board business in the past, but who are no longer
   competing for such business.

   2823.3. When collusion or anti-competitive practices are suspected among any
   offerors, a notice of the relevant facts shall be transmitted to the
   Corporation Counsel of the District of Columbia.
