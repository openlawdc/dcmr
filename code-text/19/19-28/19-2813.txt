                                  DC REGULATIONS

CERTIFIED MINORITY BUSINESS PREFERENCES (§ 19-2813)

2813.1. It is the Board’s policy to encourage the participation of minority
   business enterprises (MBE’s) in providing goods, services and construction
   for the Starplex. The CCO shall promote utilization of MBE’s to the maximum
   extent practicable to ensure compliance with the Board’s policy.

   2813.2. Priority consideration shall be given to certified MBE’s in all
   solicitations without regard to whether the solicitation is a direct or
   indirect placement in the sheltered market.

   2813.3. Priority consideration shall be accorded to qualified MBE’s or joint
   ventures by reducing by five percent (5%) the bid or price proposal of that
   minority business or joint venture, solely for purposes of comparing that bid
   or price proposal with the bids or price proposals of other firms.

   2813.4. The Board may issue solicitations in the sheltered market for the
   entire procurement or a portion of any subcontracting if, in the judgment of
   the contracting officer, the following criteria are met:
   
   
   
   (a)	There is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at
   least two (2) responsible certified minority businesses; and
   
   
   
   (b)	There is a reasonable expectation that an award will be made at reasonable
   prices.

   2813.5. In order to make this determination, the contracting officer shall
   consult the directory of the Minority Business Opportunity Commission of the
   District of Columbia (the “MBOC”) to determine the number of firms in a
   specific category capable of performing the contract, or a portion of a major
   contract.

   2813.6. Sheltered market solicitations shall be specifically identified in all
   advertisements and sent to all certified minority business enterprises (the
   “MBE’s”) which qualify under the work classification, in accordance with
   27 DCMR § 604.8.

   2813.7. The specific conditions of a solicitation issued in the sheltered
   market shall contain a section defining MBOC certification and requiring a
   copy of the MBE letter of certification to be attached to the outside cover of
   each offer.  Each solicitation to be placed entirely under the sheltered
   market shall include the following language:
   
   
   
   (a)	For direct placement -
   
   
   
   This     (Invitation for Bids or Request for Proposals) is designated for
   certified minority offerors only, under the provisions of D.C. Law 1-95,
   “The Minority Contracting Act of 1977”; or
   
   
   
   (b)	For indirect placement -
   
   
   
   In accordance with D. C. Law 4-167, D. C. Code subsection 1-1146(a) (2) [1999
   Repl.], all offerors shall include a minimum of thirty-five percent (35%)
   participation of minority business enterprises or joint ventures certified as
   such by MBOC at the time of the proposal submission date. Failure to comply
   with the requirements will eliminate your offer from further consideration for
   award of a contract.

   2813.8. Each subcontracting plan shall be reviewed by the CCO prior to award
   to ensure compliance with 27 DCMR § 606.

   2813.9. If the contracting officer determines that any offer made by a
   certified MBE is excessive or unacceptable, the CCO shall indicate the reasons
   for that determination to the Commission in writing as required in 27 DCMR §
   604.10.
