                                  DC REGULATIONS

KNOCKDOWNS AND KNOCKOUTS (§ 19-2116)

2116.1. The referees count shall be the official count.

   2116.2. If a contestant leaves the ring during the one (1) minute period
   between rounds and fails to be in the ring when the bell signals to resume
   boxing, or if a contestant fails to rise from the contestant’s chair at the
   beginning of a round, the referee shall start counting as soon as the
   round’s opening bell sounds.  The referee shall declare the contestant
   counted out unless the contestant is on his or her feet in the ring at the end
   of the ten (10) seconds.

   2116.3. The referee may disqualify any contestant who goes down without being
   struck solely to avoid a blow.

   2116.4. If a fallen contestant gets up before the count of ten (10) and goes
   down again immediately, without being struck, solely to avoid a blow, the
   referee shall resume the count where it was stopped after the first fall.

   2116.5. If a contestant is knocked down, the referee shall order the opponent
   to go to the neutral corner farthest removed from the fallen contestant and
   shall point to the corner. The referee shall immediately count over the fallen
   contestant and loudly announce the passing of seconds, accompanied with a
   downward motion of the referee’s arm indicating the end of each second.

   2116.6. If a contestant fails to stay in the farthest neutral corner while the
   contestant’s opponent is down, the referee shall stop counting until the
   contestant has returned to that corner. The referee shall then resume the
   count from the point where it was interrupted.

   2116.7. When a contestant is knocked down, the referee shall complete a count
   of eight (8), whether or not the contestant is ready to resume the contest.

   2116.8. If the contestant is still down at the count of eight (8), the referee
   shall proceed to a count of ten (10).

   2116.9. If the contestant is still down when the referee reaches the count of
   ten (10), the referee shall wave both arms to indicate that the fallen
   contestant has been knocked out and shall raise the opponent&#8217;s right
   hand to designate the winner.  In such a case, the referee shall not declare a
   technical knockout.

   2116.10. The referee shall disqualify any contestant who is knocked down three
   (3) times in any one (1) round.  The Commission may waive this rule in
   championship contests.

   2116.11. If the round ends during the count, the timekeeper shall sound the
   bell once indicating the end of the round.

   2116.12. If a contestant’s corner declares that the contestant will not
   answer the bell for a round, the other contestant shall be credited with a
   technical knockout in that round, but not, for the preceding round that has
   been fought.

   2116.13. The contestant&#8217;s manager or second shall not help back up a
   contestant who has been knocked out or who has fallen through the ropes or
   over the edge of the ring platform during a contest. The referee shall begin
   to count as soon as the contestant leaves the inside of the ring&#8217;s
   ropes. If the contestant fails to return by the count of twenty (20), the
   referee shall declare a technical knockout. The same procedure applies to a
   contestant who leaves the ring during the contest under any other
   circumstances.

   2116.14. When one contestant has fallen through the ropes, the other
   contestant shall go to the farthest neutral corner and remain there until the
   count is completed or until the first contestant is standing in the ring.

   2116.15. The referee shall disqualify a contestant who deliberately wrestles
   or throws an opponent from the ring, or who hits an opponent when the opponent
   is partly out of the ring and prevented by the ropes from assuming a position
   of defense.

   2116.16. A contestant shall be considered down when any part of the body other
   than the feet are on the floor or when the body is hanging helplessly over the
   ropes and the referee has begun to count over the contestant.

   2116.17. The referee shall motion into the ring for first aid purposes only
   the ringside physician. A knocked-out contestant may be moved only on the
   orders of the ringside physician.

   2116.18. No manager or second shall throw a towel, sponge or any other article
   into the ring as an acknowledgment of defeat.
