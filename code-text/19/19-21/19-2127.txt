                                  DC REGULATIONS

PROTECTION OF CONTESTANTS AFTER EVENT (§ 19-2127)

2127.1. After an event, the Commission, in its discretion, may order a rest
   period from four (4) to ninety (90) days in length for a contestant,
   considering the difficulty of the contest for the contestant and the number
   and severity of the blows absorbed by the contestant. The contestant shall not
   compete again for the duration of such a rest period.

   2127.2. When a contestant has been subject to repeated knockdowns or beatings,
   or for other reasons of health and safety, the Commission may request that the
   contestant retire, and should the contestant not do so, move to revoke the
   contestant&#8217;s license.

   2127.3. In case of serious injury to a contestant, the Commission may conduct
   an investigation to determine if there has been a violation of this chapter on
   the part of any person.

   2127.4. The Commission may investigate, require a medical examination of, or
   report to other jurisdictions a contestant who has had six (6) straight
   defeats.

   2127.5. If a contestant has had four (4) straight knockouts, the Commission
   may hold a hearing to determine whether the contestant is any of the
   following:
   
   
   
   (a)	 A “tanker” or contestant who intentionally loses a contest;
   
   
   
   (b)	Incompetent;
   
   
   
   (c)	Physically unfit; or
   
   
   
   (d)	Under unscrupulous management.

   2127.6. A contestant who suffers a concussion or six (6) straight knockouts
   shall not compete again for at least six (6) months following the last
   knockout. After that period, three (3) physicians appointed by the Commission,
   one of whom shall be a neurosurgeon, shall determine medically whether the
   contestant is eligible for further competition. The Commission shall then
   determine whether the contestant’s license may be revoked.  The
   physician’s examination shall include an electroencephalogram (EEG) and a
   computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan. This information shall be provided
   to the Commission and entered into the Commission&#8217;s record and into the
   contestant’s passport.

   2127.7. Except as provided in § 2127.8, a contestant who loses by a knockout
   shall not compete again for sixty (60) days, and a contestant who loses by a
   technical knockout decision shall not compete again for thirty (30) days.

   2127.8. The Commission may permit a contestant to compete before the end of
   the period provided in § 2127.7 if a physician approved by the Commission
   examines the contestant and determines that the contestant has fully
   recovered.
