SCORING (§ 19-2118)

2118.1. Scoring in boxing events shall be done by three (3) judges sitting on
   elevated seats at ringside. Judges shall clearly write and sign their
   decisions.

   2118.2. Judges shall score by the “ten (10) point must” system. The winner
   of any round is marked “ten (10)”. The loser of any round is marked “one
   (1)” to “nine (9)”. When a round is even each contestant is scored
   “ten (10)”.

   2118.3. Each Judge shall score a contest by carefully considering the elements
   of offense, defense, clean hitting, ring generalship, and sportsmanship.

   2118.4. A judge shall give credit for ring generalship to a knocked-down
   contestant who takes full advantage of the eight (8) count, and shall not give
   this credit to a contestant who rises immediately, trying to continue.

   2118.5. A contestant who uses foul blows and other tactics as listed in §
   2118.2 may be penalized two (2) points for each intentional foul committed and
   one (1) point for each unintentional foul committed. The referee shall advise
   each judge immediately after the foul occurs of the number of points to be
   deducted. This deduction shall be announced to the audience upon conclusion of
   the round in which the foul occurred.

   2118.6. The Commission may overrule the judges for cause.
