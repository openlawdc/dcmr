2114.1. In mid-ring the referee shall instruct the contestants in the
   following manner:
   
   
   
   “You are to box_____ rounds, under the rules of the District of Columbia. Do
   not hold behind the neck and punch with one hand. Do not strike a rabbit
   punch. Do not strike a kidney punch. Do not use backhand blows. Do not hit on
   the break away at any time. Step back cleanly, and break when I tell you to do
   so. Do not make me pull you apart.”
   
   
   
   “In case of a knockdown, I want the contestant scoring it to retire
   immediately to the neutral corner farthest removed from the knockdown and
   remain there until I motion him (or her) back, or I will stop counting. A
   contestant who has been knocked down shall take a count of eight. Penalties
   are scored in case of fouls. If you lose on a deliberate foul, your purse may
   be forfeited.”
   
   
   
   “Keep your punches up.”
   
   
   
   “Shake hands now and come out boxing.  Do not shake again until the
   beginning of the last round.”

   2114.2. While instructing the contestants, the referee may demonstrate the
   instructions for the benefit of the contestants and spectators.
