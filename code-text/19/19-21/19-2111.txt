BOXING GLOVES (§ 19-2111)

2111.1. A contestant may wear one winding of surgeon’s standard white
   adhesive tape not over one inch (1”) wide, placed directly on the hand, one

   wrist.

   2111.2. A contestant may wear soft surgical bandages held in place by not more
   than two feet (2’) of surgeon’s adhesive tape for each hand. Ten yards (10
   yds.) of soft surgical bandages are allowed for each hand.

   2111.3. Contestants shall not adjust the bandages except in the dressing room
   under the
   
   
   
   Supervision of an inspector and in the presence of the other contestant, or as
   the
   
   Commission’s representative directs.

   2111.4. Gloves for the main event shall be put in the ring after the referee

   shall be substituted before the contest.
   
   
   
   The inspector shall ensure that the tape, gloves, and other accoutrements worn
   or used by each contestant and second comply with this section.
