BOOKING OF EVENTS BY THE AUTHORITY (ยง 19-402)

402.1 	The Authority may book a non-convention event on its own behalf up to
twenty-four (24) months before the date of the event without prior notice to
Destination DC. The Authority may not, however, book a non-convention event to
be held at the Convention Center more than twenty-four months before the date of
the event without first providing notice to, and consulting with, Destination
DC.

402.2 	To ensure that convention event reservations for events to be held in the
Convention Center are given first priority, the Authority shall not assign a
date to a non-convention event to be held in the Convention Center if, prior to
the booking of that event, the Authority has received written notice from
Destination DC that it is in active negotiations to reserve that date for a
convention event.
