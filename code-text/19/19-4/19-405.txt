POLITICAL AND COMMUNITY EVENTS (§ 19-405)

405.1 	The facilities and resources of the Authority shall not be used to
provide any contribution, whether direct or indirect, cash or in-kind, to any
political party, political committee, candidate, or constituent services
program.



405.2 	The facilities and resources of the Authority shall not be used for any
event (other than a convention event) of which a political party, political
committee, candidate or constituent services program is the host, organizer, or
beneficiary, unless the rate to be paid for the event is at least equal to the
rate paid by for-profit clients for comparable events, but in no event less than
the cost to the Authority for holding the event.



405.3 	The terms “political party”, “political committee”,
“candidate”, and “constituent services program” as used in this section

Columbia at D.C. Official Code §§ 1-1101 et seq. and 1-1104 et seq.



405.4 	Except as prohibited by Sections 405.1 and 405.2 of this chapter, the

indirect support for community-related non-profit events, whether charitable or
governmental.



405.5 	Before the Authority provides support for any community-related
non-profit event pursuant to Section 405.4, the President and Chief Executive
Officer or designee shall determine in writing that the amount and terms of such
support further the mission of the Authority, for example, by enhancing its
ability to attract convention event, sports, entertainment and special event
bookings or by promoting essential community relations.



405.6 	Except as prohibited by Sections 405.1 and 405.2, the resources of the
Authority may be used to purchase tickets to community-related events and other
events at the Authority’s venues for distribution at less than the
Authority’s purchase price to public officials or other persons who do
business with the Authority.



405.7 	Before the Authority purchases or distributes tickets pursuant to Section
405.6, the General Counsel shall determine in writing that such purchase or
distribution does not violate the laws of the United States or the District of
Columbia.
