                                  DC REGULATIONS

COMPLAINTS (ยง 23-1900)

1900.1. The Board shall receive, at any time during the license period,
   complaints from any person alleging a violation by a licensee of the Act or
   this title. Complaints shall be in writing and set forth enough information to
   allow the Board or its staff to investigate the matter.

   1900.2. Any written complaint shall be kept confidential by the Board to the
   extent permitted by law, unless the writer specifically states that it may be
   made public.

   1900.3. All written complaints which identify the complainant by name and
   address shall be responded to in writing by the Board or its staff within
   ninety (90) days of receipt of the complaint, and shall advise the complainant
   of what action the Board or its staff has taken on the matter.

   1900.4. If the complainant has not provided the Board with a telephone number
   where he or she may be reached for additional information, and the written
   complaint has set forth insufficient information for the Board to take action,
   the Board or staff response shall so state.

   1900.5. In addition to written complaints identifying the complainant, any
   person may make an anonymous complaint in writing to the Board, or orally to
   any Investigator at ABRA. Anonymous complaints shall be investigated to the
   best of the Board&#8217;s ability, but may result in no action being taken if
   the anonymous complainant fails to provide the Board or the Investigator with
   adequate information.
