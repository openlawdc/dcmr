DECLARATORY ORDERS (ยง 23-1903)

1903.1. Any licensee or applicant for a license may make a written request to
   the Board to issue a declaratory order, as provided in D.C. Official Code ยง
   2-508, regarding the applicability of Title 25 of the D.C. Official Code, this
   title, or any other statute enforceable by the Board, to terminate a
   controversy other than a contested case or to remove uncertainty regarding a
   specific factual situation. Any request filed with the Board that involves an
   existing voluntary agreement shall be considered a contested case by the Board
   and not subject to the issuance of a declaratory order.

   1903.2. Any request for a declaratory order shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	Set forth a particular and specific set of facts; and
   
   
   
   (b)	State in detail the reasons for uncertainty as to the applicability of the
   Act, this title or other statutes enforceable by the Board or state in detail
   why a controversy exists.

   1903.3. Any declaratory order issued by the Board shall state the
   Board&#8217;s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. If the circumstances so
   warrant, the declaratory order may include an order by the Board to the
   requestor to cease and desist any practice or activity which is violative of
   applicable statutes or this title.

   1903.4. All facts asserted in a request for a declaratory order shall be
   supported by sworn affidavit of the requestor. If the Board determines that
   further facts are necessary, it shall request the requestor to provide those
   facts by written affidavit or may receive those facts by stipulation at a
   non-contested case fact-finding hearing.

   1903.5. Any requestor who is aggrieved by a declaratory order or who disagrees
   with the declaratory order in any respect may appeal the order by:
   
   
   
   (a)	Petitioning the Board, in writing, within twenty (20) calendar days after
   issuance of the declaratory order, to reconsider its order, and by setting
   forth in detail newly discovered facts or by setting forth legal argument
   which shows one (1) or more errors of law in the Board&#8217;s order; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Seeking judicial review of the Board&#8217;s order as permitted under D.C.
   Official Code ยง 2-510.

   1903.6. All declaratory orders of the Board determined to be in the public
   interest in accordance with D.C. Official Code ยง 2-508, shall be published in
   the D.C. Register and shall be available for public inspection and copying at
   a reasonable charge at the offices of the Board.
