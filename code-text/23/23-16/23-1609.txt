                                  DC REGULATIONS

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS (§ 23-1609)

1609.1. The terms of a settlement agreement submitted by the parties shall be
   consistent with District of Columbia law and shall be in compliance with D.C.
   Official Code §§ 25-446.01 and 25-446.02.

   1609.2. The Board may initiate a &#8220;Notice to Show Cause Hearing&#8221;
   upon evidence that the holder of a license has violated the material terms of
   the agreement. Upon a determination that the licensee has materially violated
   the agreement, the Board may suspend or revoke the license or impose any other
   penalty authorized by the Act or this title.

   1609.3. A request to amend a cooperative/voluntary agreement shall be
   considered by the Board pursuant to the substantial change and notice
   procedures set forth in D.C. Official Code §§ 25-404 and 25-762.

   1609.4. Upon finding that a licensee has materially violated certain
   conditions required by the Board, as authorized by this section, the Board may
   also fine a licensee pursuant to the range of fines set forth in D.C. Official
   Code § 25-830.

   1609.5. The phrase &#8220;cooperative agreement&#8221; often used in
   agreements reached between applicants and protestants that are submitted to
   the Board for approval shall be considered synonymous with the phrase
   &#8220;voluntary agreement&#8221; and shall have the same meaning in these
   regulations.

   1609.6. The phrase “settlement agreement” found in Title 25 of the D.C.
   Official Code shall be deemed equivalent to the term “cooperative
   agreement”, or “voluntary agreement” used in Title 23 of the D.C.
   Municipal Regulations.”

   1609.7. If the Board determines that a settlement agreement submitted by the
   parties does not comply with all applicable laws and regulations, or otherwise
   exceeds the Board’s expertise to enforce, the Board may condition approval
   of the settlement agreement on the parties’ acceptance of modifications of
   the agreement proposed by the Board.  If the parties reject the modifications
   proposed by the Board, they may submit a new settlement agreement for Board
   review that complies with D.C. Official Code §§ 25-446.01 and 25-446.02 and
   is within the Board’s expertise to enforce, or proceed to a protest hearing.

   1609.8. Settlement agreements must be submitted by the parties to the Board
   for the Board’s consideration no later than ninety (90) days after the
   execution of the settlement agreement by parties who are signatories to the
   settlement agreement.
