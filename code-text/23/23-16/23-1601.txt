                                  DC REGULATIONS

ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW. (§ 23-1601)

1601.1. Before any license is issued, renewed, or transferred to a new
   location, and before any substantial change to the operations of a licensed
   establishment may be made, the Board shall provide notice to the public
   pursuant to the notice requirements set forth under §§ 1502, 1503, and 1504.
   Notice provided to the public shall specify the information required by D.C.
   Official Code § 25-423(b), including the final day of the protest period and
   the license application&#8217;s administrative review date.

   1601.2. The administrative review hearing shall be a non-adversarial
   proceeding held by the Board&#8217;s agent at which a list of applications for
   the licensing actions set out in § 1605.1 and the names of protestants who
   have filed an objection pursuant to D.C. Official Code § 25-601 shall be read
   to the public. For purposes of this section, the Board&#8217;s agent shall be
   defined as an ABRA Office of the General Counsel employee at or above the
   Grade 12 level, excluding the ABRA General Counsel.

   1601.3. If no written objection to an application has been received by the
   Board during the protest period, the Board&#8217;s agent shall hold an
   administrative review on the application within fifteen (15) calendar days
   after the end of the protest period. An objection must be received by the
   Board prior to the end of the protest period to be considered timely filed.

   1601.4. If an objection, in the form of a protest or by Protest Petitions (as
   set forth in § 1800.2 of this title), has been received by the Board during
   the protest period, the Board&#8217;s agent shall so state and the
   Board&#8217;s agent shall set a date for a status hearing before the Board
   unless the scheduling of a roll call hearing before the Board is necessary as
   required by § 1602A. 8. In setting a date for a status hearing, the
   Board&#8217;s agent may also approve a joint request by the parties to
   schedule a settlement conference prior to the status hearing date.

   1601.5. Each applicant, and each person submitting a protest shall attend the
   administrative review hearing in person or appear through a designated
   representative.

   1601.6. Failure to appear at the administrative review hearing either in
   person or through a designated representative may result in denial of the
   license application or dismissal of a protest unless good cause is shown for
   the failure to appear. Examples of good cause for failure to appear include,
   but are not limited to:
   
   
   
   (a)	sudden, severe illness or accident;
   
   
   
   (b)	death or sudden illness in the immediate family, such as spouse, partner
   children, parents, siblings;
   
   
   
   (c)	incarceration; or
   
   
   
   (d)	severe inclement weather.

   1601.7. A recommendation by the Board&#8217;s agent to deny a license
   application or dismiss a protest for failure to attend the administrative
   review shall be forwarded to the Board for consideration in writing. The
   Board&#8217;s decision to adopt or not adopt the recommendation of the
   Board&#8217;s agent to deny a license application or dismiss a protest for
   failure to appear shall be sent to the parties in writing. A request for
   reinstatement with the Board must be filed within ten (10) days after
   notification from the Board of the dismissal or denial. In reviewing the
   request, the Board shall consider whether, in the discretion of the Board, the
   party has shown good cause for his or her failure to appear at the
   administrative review.

   1601.8. The Board&#8217;s agent shall schedule a roll call hearing for the
   next regularly scheduled Board meeting rather than a status hearing before the
   Board when:
   
   
   
   (a)	a dispute exists regarding whether the placards at an applicant&#8217;s
   premises have remained visible to the public for a full forty-five (45)
   calendar days;
   
   
   
   (b)	a legal issue is raised that would preclude the Board from granting the
   application, including but not limited to:
   
   
   
   (1)	the applicant&#8217;s distance from a school or recreation center operated
   by the D.C. Department of Recreation;
   
   
   
   (2)	whether the applicant&#8217;s proposed establishment is located in a
   residential-use district; and
   
   
   
   (3)	whether the applicant&#8217;s voluntary agreement prohibits the
   application;
   
   
   
   (c)	a dispute exists regarding the legal standing of a party or whether a
   party has raised legally permitted protest issues; or
   
   
   
   (d)	any other legal issue arises that requires a decision by the Board. When a
   dispute arises regarding the applicant&#8217;s distance from a school or
   recreation center operated by the D.C. Department of Recreation, the
   Board&#8217;s agent shall request that a measurement be conducted by ABRA in
   advance of the scheduled roll call hearing.

   1601.9. At the administrative review, the Board&#8217;s agent shall have the
   authority to:
   
   
   
   (a)	regulate the course of the hearing;
   
   
   
   (b)	request the persons appearing at the hearing to state their respective
   positions concerning any issues in the proceeding and their support of or
   opposition to such issues;
   
   
   
   (c)	request or accept written documentation from the parties including letters
   of representation;
   
   
   
   (d)	identify the parties with standing and the filed protest issues, if
   undisputed;
   
   
   
   (e)	approve a joint request from the parties for a scheduled settlement
   conference;
   
   
   
   (f)	grant a request to continue the administrative review consistent with the
   requirements of D.C. Official Code § 25-441 and § 1705;
   
   
   
   (g)	adjourn a hearing and establish the date when the hearing will be
   continued; and
   
   
   
   (h)	take any other action authorized by, or necessary under, this section.

   1601.10. Upon the scheduling of an application for administrative review with
   the Board&#8217;s agent, all parties shall be prohibited from participating in
   any ex parte communication with the Board&#8217;s agent relevant to the merits
   of the proceeding. This shall include any oral or written communication not in
   the public hearing record with respect to which reasonable prior notice is not
   given to all parties to the proceeding.

   1601.11. The administrative review shall be open to the public and transcribed
   by a certified court reporter.
