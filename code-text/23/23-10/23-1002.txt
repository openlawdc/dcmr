                                  DC REGULATIONS

COVER CHARGE (§ 23-1002)

1002.1. The licensee under a license, class C/R, D/R, C/H, D/H, C/T, or D/T,
   shall obtain an entertainment endorsement to have a cover charge. For purposes
   of this section, a cover charge is a fee required by an establishment to be
   paid by patrons for admission that is not directly applied to the purchase of
   food or drink.

   1002.2. An applicant shall follow the entertainment endorsement application
   and notice procedures set forth in § 1001; provided, that an entertainment
   endorsement application that solely requests approval from the Board to charge
   a cover charge shall not be considered a substantial change under D.C.
   Official Code § 25-404. Opposition to a cover charge shall also not be
   considered grounds for filing an objection under D.C. Official Code §
   25-602(a) to an entertainment endorsement application.

   1002.3. The licensee under a license, class C/N or D/N, shall be permitted to
   have a cover charge without an entertainment endorsement unless restricted by
   Board order or cooperative/voluntary agreement.

   1002.4. The licensee under a license, class C or D, with a certificate of
   occupancy over 400 persons shall also be required to obtain a public hall
   certificate of occupancy from the Zoning Administrator and an entertainment
   endorsement for a public hall from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory
   Affairs pursuant to D.C. Official Code § 47-2820 to be eligible to charge a
   cover charge.
