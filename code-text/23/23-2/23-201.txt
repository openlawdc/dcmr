                                  DC REGULATIONS

AUCTION PERMIT (ยง 23-201)

201.1. There shall be two types of auction permits under this section. A
   public auction permit shall authorize either (1) a licensee who is going out
   of business or had its license not renewed or revoked, or (2) the
   licensee&#8217;s successor, to auction alcoholic beverages for sale at the
   Board approved location that may be taken off the premises by the purchasing
   party. A personal auction permit shall authorize the holder of the permit to
   auction off for sale the personal alcoholic beverage stock of an individual or
   his or her estate at the Board approved location that may be taken off the
   premises by the purchasing party. A personal auction permit to sell alcoholic
   beverages at an estate sale may be obtained by either an off-premises retailer
   or wholesaler licensed to carry the products being sold or an individual or
   corporate entity without an ABC license. However, a personal auction permit to
   sell an individual&#8217;s own private alcoholic beverage stock not related to
   an estate sale must be obtained by an off-premises retailer or wholesaler
   licensed to carry the products being sold.

   201.2. Any purchased barrel, keg, sealed bottle, or other closed container
   purchased at auction shall not be opened, or the contents consumed, at the
   approved location.

   201.3. An auction permit shall not be issued for more than two (2) consecutive
   days.

   201.4. An auction permit shall not be issued more than once a year to an
   individual or corporate entity that does not hold an ABC license.
