208.1. All license fees shall be paid by credit card, certified check, money
   order, business check, attorney&#8217;s check, or personal check payable to
   ABRA. Applicants and licensees shall pay the annual fees specified by the
   Board in the following manner:
   
   
   
   (a)	The fee for the first year shall be paid at the time an application is
   filed, but shall be returned to an applicant, minus the prescribed processing
   fee, if the application is denied; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The fees for the second and third year shall be paid no later than one (1)
   and two (2) years, respectively, from the date of the issuance of the license;
   provided, that a licensee may pay the second and third year fees when the
   first year fee is paid. The payment of the second and third year license fees
   shall not require the filing of a clean-hands certificate by the applicant.

   208.2. The Board may impose a late fee upon a licensee for failure to timely
   remit the second or third year fee, or the renewal fee, in the amount of fifty
   dollars ($50) for each day after the due date of payment. The total amount of
   the late fee to be paid to ABRA shall not exceed the annual cost of the
   license. The Board may suspend a license until the licensee pays the second or
   third year fee and any additional fee imposed by the Board for late payment. A
   licensee who has not renewed timely shall not be permitted to sell or serve
   alcoholic beverages with an expired license.

   208.3. The Board may suspend a license, permit, or endorsement where payment
   was made by the applicant to ABRA with a check returned unpaid. The applicant,
