                                  DC REGULATIONS

FOOD SALES REQUIREMENT COMPLIANCE (§ 23-2101)

2101.1. The Board shall monitor licensed establishments, class C/R, D/R, C/H,
   and D/H, for compliance with the food sales requirements set forth in D.C.
   Official Code §§ 25-101(43) and 25-113.

   2101.2. The initial auditing period to monitor compliance shall be not less
   than one (1) quarter. The Board shall continue to monitor an establishment
   which is found not to be in compliance for a period of one (1) year.

   2101.3. Substantial lack of compliance by the licensee under a license, class
   C/R, D/R, C/H, or D/H, for a single year shall result in sanctions and
   continued monitoring, and may be used as contributing evidence of
   non-compliance with Title 25 of the D.C. Official Code and this title in
   protests or other proceedings. Substantial lack of compliance during or more
   than a full year shall result in sanctions that may include revocation by the
   Board or change in license class, if permissible. The Board shall follow the
   show cause notice procedures prior to imposing any sanction against a
   licensee.

   2101.4. Minimal lack of compliance by the licensee under a license, class C/R,
   D/R, C/H, or D/H, for a single year shall result in a show cause hearing with
   the Board imposing one or more of the penalties set forth in § 2101.5,
   excluding revocation. The Board may issue a warning and continue monitoring of
   an establishment with a minimal lack of compliance if the establishment was in
   compliance with the food sales requirements of D.C. Official Code §§
   25-101(43) and 25-113 for the majority of the year that the establishment was
   monitored. An establishment found by the Board to have a minimal lack of
   compliance for two (2) or more successive years shall be deemed to have a
   substantial lack of compliance with the food sales requirement.

   2101.5. The Board may impose the following additional or alternative sanctions
   against an establishment which is in non-compliance with the minimum food
   sales requirements:
   
   
   
   (a)	Revocation of the establishment&#8217;s entertainment endorsement, if any;
   
   
   
   (b)	A reduction in the establishment&#8217;s operating hours;
   
   
   
   (c)	A fine based upon the primary tier fine schedule set forth in D.C.
   Official Code §§ 25-830(c) and 25-801;
   
   
   
   (d)	Revocation or suspension of the license; or
   
   
   
   (e)	Require a change in license class, if permissible.
