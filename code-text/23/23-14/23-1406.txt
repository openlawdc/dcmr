1406.1. If any licensee shall fail in any calendar month to pay when due the
   tax owed by the licensee on alcoholic beverages sold by the licensee in the
   preceding calendar month, the OTR may, in its discretion, as security for the
   payment of the tax on alcoholic beverages for which the licensee may
   thereafter be liable, do the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Require the licensee to deposit with the D.C. Treasurer, within ten (10)
   days after the mailing by the OTR of a written demand to the licensee for the
   deposit, an amount in cash equal to twice the licensee&#8217;s average
   liability per month for tax on alcoholic beverages for the twelve (12)
   calendar months immediately preceding the month in which the default occurs;
   or
   
   
   
   (b)	Require the licensee to file statements showing the quantity of alcoholic
   beverages subject to taxation for the total calendar months immediately
   preceding the month of default, if the number of months preceding the month of
   default is less than twelve (12) months.

   1406.2. Upon any failure of the licensee making a deposit to pay when due any
   tax thereafter owed by the licensee on alcoholic beverages, the OTR shall
   apply the deposit to the payment of the delinquent tax, and the licensee
   shall, within seventy-two (72) hours after receipt of a written notice from
   the OTR to the licensee of the application of the deposit to the payment of
   the tax, again deposit with the D.C. Treasurer, in cash, an amount equal to
   the amount so applied.
