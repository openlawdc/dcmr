704.1. A license required to be in safekeeping pursuant to D.C. Official Code
   § 25-791 may be placed in safekeeping by either the Board or the licensee. A
   request by the licensee to place the license in safekeeping shall be in

   months to determine whether the licensee has made sufficient progress toward
   reopening or whether the license should be cancelled by the Board.

   704.3. Notwithstanding § 704.2, a license for premises located in a
   moratorium area shall be permitted to be kept in safekeeping with the Board
   for the length of the moratorium subject to the removal requirements set forth
   in D.C. Official Code § 25-791(f).

   704.4. Whenever a license is being kept in safekeeping with the Board, the
   licensee shall upon requesting the removal of the license from safekeeping,
   submit for Board approval detailed plans of its operations upon reopening and
   shall notify the Board of the anticipated reopening date.
