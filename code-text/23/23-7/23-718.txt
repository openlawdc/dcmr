REIMBURSABLE DETAIL SUBSIDY PROGRAM (§ 23-718)

718.1. This section sets forth the procedures for receiving reimbursement from
   ABRA under the subsidy program for monies paid to the Metropolitan Police
   Department (&#8220;MPD&#8221;) by licensees for the hiring of MPD officers to
   work a reimbursable detail. A licensee, a group of licensees, or a Business
   Improvement District on behalf of licensees (&#8220;licensees&#8221;), may
   enter into an agreement with MPD to provide for reimbursable detail and are
   eligible for reimbursement under the subsidy program. This section shall apply
   only to the extent that:
   
   
   
   (a)	The Council funds the subsidy program; and
   
   
   
   (b)	ABRA has sufficient funds earmarked for this program remaining to
   reimburse MPD for costs incurred by licensees for MPD officers working
   reimbursable details.
   
   
   
   718.2   	ABRA will reimburse MPD fifty percent (50%) of the total cost of
   invoices submitted by MPD to cover the costs incurred by licensees for MPD
   officers working reimbursable details on Friday and Saturday nights and
   District or federal Holidays.  The hours eligible for reimbursement shall be
   11:30 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.  MPD shall submit to ABRA on a monthly basis invoices
   documenting the fifty percent (50%) amount owed by each licensee.  Invoices
   will be paid by ABRA to MPD within thirty (30) days of receipt in the order
   that they are received until the subsidy program’s funds are depleted.

   718.3. ABRA shall notify MPD when funds in the subsidy program fall below two
   hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000).

   718.4. Any invoices unpaid by ABRA either for good cause or a lack of
   sufficient funds left in the subsidy program shall remain the responsibility
   of the licensee.

   718.5. ABRA shall not be involved in determining the number of MPD officers
   needed to work a reimbursable detail.
