                                  DC REGULATIONS

TRADE NAMES AND CORPORATE NAMES (ยง 23-600)

600.1. No person licensed under the Act shall use any name other than that of
   an individual licensee or licensees, including a corporate or trade name,
   without first obtaining approval from the Board for use of the corporate or
   trade name.

   600.2. A person licensed under this Act may file a written request with the
   Board to add an additional trade name at a location currently authorized for
   the sale of alcoholic beverages under its ABC license. The Board in its
   discretion may approve the use of an additional trade name at an ABC
   establishment. Any additional trade name approved by the Board shall appear on
   the establishment&#8217;s ABC license.

   600.3. An additional trade name shall not be used to identify a location
   separate and apart from the licensed premises. When a licensed establishment
   uses an additional trade name, its patrons must be able to access the area of
   the licensed premises identified by the additional trade name from the area of
   the licensed premises identified by the original trade name.

   600.4. Any trade name requested by an applicant shall not be identical or
   confusingly similar to one currently used under a previously issued license.
