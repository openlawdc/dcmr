                                  DC REGULATIONS

PROHIBITED BUSINESS INTERESTS (ยง 23-403)

403.1. The spouse of an ABC license holder may apply for a separate ABC
   license if he or she can establish that the conflict provisions of D.C.
   Official Code ยง 25-303 will not be violated. Specifically, in applying for a
   license the spouse not holding an ABC license must submit a signed and
   notarized affidavit which states that:
   
   
   
   (a)	the applicant has no present or future ownership interest in any other ABC
   establishment that the applicant is prohibited from owning under D.C. Official
   Code ยง 25-303;
   
   
   
   (b)	the applicant&#8217;s spouse will have no ownership interest in the
   license being sought by the applicant;
   
   
   
   (c)	the applicant or another corporation (in which the spouse is not an
   officer, shareholder or member) is solely liable for the business rather than
   the spouse or spouse&#8217;s business;
   
   
   
   (d)	the other spouse will not have any operational control over the
   establishment and will not serve in a management capacity for the ABC
   establishment or apply for an ABC Manager&#8217;s license for that
   establishment; and
   
   
   
   (e)	the applicant will not transfer any alcoholic beverage inventory to or
   receive any alcoholic beverage inventory from their spouse&#8217;s ABC
   licensed establishment.

   403.2. The applicant shall provide documentation, upon request of the Board,
   necessary to validate the applicant&#8217;s sworn affidavit. Failure to submit
   the necessary documentation within ten (10) business days of the Board&#8217;s
   request may result in the suspension or revocation of the applicant&#8217;s
   license, unless an extension is granted by the Board.
