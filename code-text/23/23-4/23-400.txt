APPROPRIATENESS REQUIREMENTS (ยง 23-400)

400.1. For purposes of establishing the appropriateness of the establishment
   under D.C. Official Code ยง 25-313(b)(1) through (3), the applicant shall
   present to the Board such evidence and argument as would lead a reasonable
   person to conclude the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The establishment will not interfere with the peace, order, and quiet of
   the relevant area, considering such elements as noise, rowdiness, loitering,
   litter, and criminal activity;
   
   
   
   (b)	The establishment will not have an adverse impact on residential parking
   needs, considering available public and private parking and any arrangements
   made to secure such parking for the clientele of the establishment; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The flow of traffic to be generated by the establishment will be of such
   pattern and volume as to neither increase the likelihood of vehicular
   accidents nor put pedestrians at an unreasonable risk of harm from vehicles.
   
   
   
   (d)	The establishment will not have an adverse impact on real property values
   in the locality, section, or portion of the District of Columbia where it is
   to be located.

   400.2. The Board shall not consider objections to the issuance of a
   Retailer&#8217;s license Class CN or DN, based upon adverse impact as set
   forth in D.C. Official Code ยง 25-314(c), when the establishment for which the
   license is sought is situated in a hotel and when a Retailer&#8217;s license
   Class CN or DN may properly be issued.

   400.3. Whenever an applicant has initially presented evidence to show that the
   establishment is appropriate, any person opposing the license shall present to
   the Board such evidence and argument as would establish the inappropriateness
   of the establishment, and as would overcome, to the satisfaction of a
   reasonable person, the evidence and argument presented by the applicant.
