PURCHASE OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES (§ 23-2002)

2002.1. A Caterer licensed under § 2000.1 shall not purchase alcoholic
   beverages from a Wholesaler other than for scheduled events to be attended by
   one hundred (100) persons or less. Upon purchasing alcoholic beverages for an
   event of one hundred (100) persons or less from a Wholesaler, a Caterer shall
   immediately provide the following information to the Wholesaler on a form
   prescribe by ABRA:
   
   
   
   (a)	A description of the alcoholic beverages being purchased; and
   
   
   
   (b)	A description, including the location, of the scheduled event for which
   the alcoholic beverages are being purchased.

   2002.2. Caterers shall maintain distinct records identifying the alcoholic
   beverages purchased from Wholesalers for each scheduled event of one hundred
   (100) persons or less and shall make such records available for inspection,
   upon request, by the Board and by the Wholesaler from which the alcoholic
   beverages were purchased. A Caterer licensed under § 2000.1 shall, concurrent
   with the information required in § 2006, provide to the Board a sworn
   affidavit on a form prepared by ABRA attesting that, in the preceding
   reporting period, it has used alcoholic beverages purchased from Wholesalers
   only for events of one hundred (100) persons or less. Upon request of the
   Board, the Caterer shall identify the Wholesaler(s) from whom alcoholic
   beverages have been purchased. The submission of a knowingly false or
   misleading affidavit shall be grounds for the Board to order the licensee to
   show cause why the license should not be suspended or revoked, or a civil fine
   imposed based upon the primary tier schedule set forth in D.C. Official Code
   § 25-830(c) and Chapter 8.
