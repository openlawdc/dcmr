                                  DC REGULATIONS

WARNINGS (§ 23-805)

805.1. An ABRA investigator or MPD Officer is not precluded from issuing an   
    administrative written warning before the issuance of a citation for a
   violation as permitted by § 800 of this title.
   
   
   
   805.2  	In not less than ten (10) business days following the issuance of an
   administrative written warning, an ABRA investigator shall conduct a
   subsequent inspection of the licensed premises to ensure that the licensee has
   taken corrective action for the violation found for which the administrative
   written warning was issued.  If corrections to violations that resulted in the
   issuance of the administrative written warning are not completed at the time
   of the subsequent inspection, the ABRA investigator shall issue the licensee a
   citation or refer the matter to the ABC Board if (1) the licensee observes
   other violations that are not entitled to a warning or (2) the licensee
   already has three or more secondary tier violations.
   
   
   
   805.3 	A licensee entitled to a mandatory administrative written warning for a
   first violation shall not be entitled to a mandatory administrative written
   warning for a second or subsequent violation of the same offense. There shall
   be no expiration period on this subsection’s prohibition against issuing a
   mandatory administrative written warning for a subsequent violation of the
   same offense.
