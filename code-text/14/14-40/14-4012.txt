DECISIONS OF HEARING EXAMINERS (§ 14-4012)

4012.1. Hearing examiners shall prepare a draft decision for each case or
   petition. Each draft decision shall be immediately transmitted to the Rent
   Administrator for review.

   4012.2. Each draft decision shall contain the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Findings of fact and conclusions of law (including the reasons or basis of
   those findings) upon each material contested issue of fact and law presented
   on the record;
   
   
   
   (b)	A proposed order as to the final disposition of the hearing or petition,
   including appropriate relief and any penalties; and
   
   
   
   (c)	A statement of the parties’ right to appeal to the Commission.

   4012.3. If the hearing examiner concludes that some contested issues of fact
   are not material to the proceeding and therefore do not need to be decided,
   specific findings of fact and conclusions of law to that effect shall be
   included in the draft decision.

   4012.4. Pursuant to the written delegation of authority issued under §
   3900.3, if the person who renders the decision and order is not the same
   person who has heard the evidence, then the procedures of D.C. Official Code
   § 2-509(d) (2001) shall be followed.

   4012.5. Each decision shall become final and effective when rendered pursuant
   to § 4012.4, except that if a motion for reconsideration is filed, the
   decision shall not become final until the motion is disposed of in accordance
   with § 4013.

   4012.6. The ten (10) day time limit in which an appeal to the Commission shall
   befiled, as prescribed in § 216 of the Act and § 3802.2, shall begin to run
   when the decision becomes final.
