REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF INCLUSIONARY ZONING
COMPLIANCE (§ 14-2203)

If the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs determines that an
application for a Certificate of Inclusionary Zoning Compliance does not
demonstrate compliance with the Inclusionary Zoning Program or the information
provided is insufficient, the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs
shall provide to the Inclusionary Development Owner a written notice of the
deficiency and shall allow the Inclusionary Development Owner a reasonable
period of time, designated in the written notice, to cure the deficiency.







If the Inclusionary Development Owner fails to cure the deficiency within the
period of time set forth in the written notice, the Department of Consumer and
Regulatory Affairs may deny the application.







If the application for a Certificate of Inclusionary Zoning Compliance
demonstrates compliance with the Inclusionary Zoning Program, and the proposed
Inclusionary Development Covenant conforms to the requirements of § 2204, the
Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs shall review and issue the
Certificate of Inclusionary Zoning Compliance and the Department of Housing and
Community Development shall review and issue the Inclusionary Development
Covenant prior to final approval of the building permit application.







The building permit application may be approved only after both the Certificate
of Inclusionary Zoning Compliance and the Inclusionary Development Covenant are
filed among land records.
