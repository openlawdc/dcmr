                                  DC REGULATIONS

REQUEST FOR HEARING (§ 14-6303)

6303.1. If the complainant is not satisfied with the proposed disposition of
   his or her complaint, he or she may submit in person or by mail a written
   request for a hearing. Upon request, DCHA will assist a complainant in putting
   his or her complaint in writing. The written request shall be provided:
   
   
   
   (a)	To the Office of Fair Hearings (OFH); or
   
   
   
   (b)	To the OFH through the office of the property in which the complainant
   resides.
   
   
   
   On determinations of ineligibility for applicants for public housing, the
   notice will include the complaint form by which families can request a hearing
   and return it to DCHA. The complaint form will also be available to applicants
   and residents at all DCHA offices.

   6303.2. A complainant’s request for a hearing, which shall be in writing,
   shall be filed as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	If the complainant is a resident, within seven (7) working days from the
   date the answer is served; or
   
   
   
   (b)	If the complainant is an applicant, within ten (10) working days from the
   date the answer is mailed.

   6303.3. If the complainant does not request a hearing within the specified
   time, DCHA’s disposition of the complaint under § 6302.4 shall become
   final. This shall not constitute a waiver of the complainant’s right to
   contest DCHA’s actions in an appropriate judicial proceeding.

   6303.4. Upon receipt of a request for a hearing, OFH shall assign a hearing
   officer to the complaint from the hearing panel, on a rotating basis to the
   extent possible.

   6303.5. Within fifteen (15) working days, the hearing officer shall schedule a
   hearing time, date and place, reasonably convenient to both the complainant
   and the DCHA, and shall notify the complainant and DCHA.

   6303.6. Within thirty (30) days of the date the hearing is scheduled, OFH
   shall convene the hearing, unless rescheduled for good cause by the assigned
   hearing officer.
