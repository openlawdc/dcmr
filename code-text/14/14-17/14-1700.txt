   authority of Title III of the District of Columbia Rental Housing Act of 1985,

   	AUTHORITY: Unless otherwise noted, the authority for this chapter is section
   302(e) of the Rental Housing Act of 1985, D.C. Law 6-10 (D.C. Official Code §
   42-3503.02(e) (2001)) and Mayor’s Order 86-27, effective February 6, 1986,

   	SOURCE: Notice of Final Rulemaking published at 33 DCR 4396 (July 25, 1986);
   as amended by Notice of Final Rulemaking published at 36 DCR 4472 (June 23,
   1989).
   
   
   
   	EDITOR’S NOTE: The rules relating to the Tenant Assistance Program were
   originally adopted by the Director of the Department of Housing and Community
   Development. Under Part IIA(f) and B(2) of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1987,
   D.C. Official Code, Vol. 3, 385 (2001), all functions relating to the
   administration of the Tenant Assistance Program were transferred from the
   Director of the Department of Housing and Community Development (“DHCD”)
   to the Director of the Department of Public and Assisted Housing (“DPAH”).
   D.C. Law 10-243, the “District of Columbia Housing Authority Act of 1994,”
   abolished the Department of Public and Assisted Housing (DPAH) and established
   the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA) as a corporate body and
   legal instrumentality of the government of the District of Columbia. D.C. Law
   13-105, the “District of Columbia Housing Authority Act of 1999,” repealed
   D.C. Law 10-243 and re-established the DCHA as an independent authority of the
   District government and the successor in interest to the former housing
   authority. Accordingly, the term “Director” in chapters 17 through 21 of
   this title refers to the Director of the DCHA.
