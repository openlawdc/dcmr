                                  DC REGULATIONS

RENTS FOR HOUSING UNITS RECEIVING SUBSIDY ALLOCATIONS (§ 14-2004)

2004.1. The Payment Standard applied to housing units receiving allocations
   shall be as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	One hundred percent (100%) of the applicable Payment Standard Schedule for
   units where no rehabilitation work is anticipated;
   
   
   
   (b)	Up to one hundred percent (100%) of the payment applicable for newly
   constructed or rehabilitated housing for units where construction or
   rehabilitation work is anticipated or has occurred within the last twelve (12)
   months. The percentage of the payment standard allowed shall be consistent
   with an amount determined by DCHA to be reasonable; or
   
   
   
   (c)	A higher amount, not to exceed the Fair Market Rents set forth in §
   1906.1, where the Director of DCHA determines that construction or
   rehabilitation is not feasible within the limits of subsection 2004.1(b).

   2004.2. Subsequent increases in rent levels, after initial occupancy, shall be
   established as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	For units subject to the District’s rent stabilization law, periodic
   increases shall be allowed in accordance with § 1916.5; or
   
   
   
   (b)	For properties not subject to the District’s rent stabilization law,
   rent increases shall be the lesser of the following:
   
   
   
   (1)	The percentage increase in any revised Payment Standard Schedule, by
   appropriate unit size, shall be applied to the previous rent level approved;
   or
   
   
   
   (2)	The amount allowed under a rent regulatory agreement pursuant to another
   assistance program of the District government.

   2004.3. If the amount allowed under § 2004.2(b) is not sufficient to meet
   reasonable costs of the housing provider, a request may be made for approval
   of a higher rent level for payment calculations based on documented costs
   satisfactory to DCHA.

   2004.4. The schedule of allowances for Tenant Paid Utilities in units
   receiving allocations shall be the same as the schedule of allowances for
   similar properties.
