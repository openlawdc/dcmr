                                  DC REGULATIONS

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSING AUTHORITY&#8217;S HOUSING ASSISTANCE PAYMENT (§
14-5308)

5308.1. DCHA shall pay a monthly Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) for a Family
   that is equal to the lower of:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The applicable payment standard for the Family minus the Family’s TTP; or
   
   
   
   (b) 	The gross rent for the Family’s unit minus the TTP.

   5308.2. The rent to the owner is the full rent that the owner is charging for
   the unit, as approved by DCHA, including any utilities the owner is providing
   under the lease.  This is the Contract Rent.
   
   
   
   5308.3 	The gross rent represents the entire housing cost.  It is calculated
   by adding the contract rent to the utility allowance for the unit.  If all
   utilities are included, the contract rent and the gross rent shall be the
   same.
   
   
   
   5308.4 	The Family share of rent is any amount of DCHA approved contract rent
   that is not covered by HAP.

   5308.5. If a Family chooses a unit with a gross rent (rent to owner plus an
   allowance for tenant-paid utilities) that exceeds DCHA’s applicable payment
   standard:
   
   
   
   (a)	The Family shall pay more than the TTP; and
   
   
   
   (b) 	At initial occupancy DCHA may not approve the tenancy if it would require
   the Family share to exceed forty percent (40%) of the Family’s monthly
   adjusted income.

   5308.6. When the DCHA HAP for a Family exceeds the rent to owner, the Family
   is due a utility reimbursement. DCHA may pay the reimbursement to the Family
   or directly to the utility provider as enumerated in 24 C.F.R. § 5.632(b)(2).
    If all utilities are included in the contract rent, there shall be no utility
   allowance.
