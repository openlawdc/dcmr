                                  DC REGULATIONS

CORRECTING HOUSING QUALITY STANDARDS DEFICIENCIES DURING INITIAL INSPECTIONS (ยง
14-5324)

5324.1. DCHA shall schedule a timely inspection of the unit upon receipt of a
   Request for Lease Approval and Lease. The Family and the owner shall be
   notified of the results.

   5324.2. Prior to the scheduled inspection, the participant shall be provided
   with a pre-inspection checklist to be completed by the owner or landlord and
   returned to DCHA before the first initial inspection visit.

   5324.3. If the unit fails the Housing Quality standards inspection, DCHA shall
   schedule a re-inspection.

   5324.4. On an initial new move-in inspection, the owner shall generally be
   given fourteen (14) days to correct the items noted as &#8220;Fail&#8221;
   depending on the extent of the repairs that have to be made, unless there are
   extenuating circumstances.  However, the owner shall be required to complete
   the repairs by the Lease Start Date.

   5324.5. The owner shall generally be allowed up to one (1) re-inspection for
   repair work to be completed. Depending on the amount and complexity of work to
   be done, the Inspections Department may move the re-inspection out beyond
   fourteen (14) days.

   5324.6. If the time period given by the Inspector to correct the repairs (or
   two (2) failed re-inspections, if required by the Inspector) expires, the
   Family may select another unit or, if they want to continue to try to lease
   this unit, the Family and owner shall have to submit another Request for Lease
   Approval.

   5324.7. Upon submission of a Request for Lease Approval and Lease, the term of
   the voucher is suspended, such that if a unit does not pass Housing Quality
   Standards, or the lease is not approved by DCHA, the remaining time on the
   voucher is available to the Family without requesting an extension.
