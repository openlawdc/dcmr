                                  DC REGULATIONS

APPLYING UTILITY ALLOWANCES (§ 14-5311)

5311.1. The utility allowance is calculated for each Family based upon
   DCHA’s utility allowance schedule, which is based on the average utility
   costs for a unit of comparable size.  DCHA shall periodically update the
   utility allowance to account for increases in energy costs.  The allowances
   set by DCHA are applicable to all program types.

   5311.2. A DCHA-established utility allowance schedule is used in determining
   Family share and HAP. DCHA shall use the appropriate utility allowance for the
   size of dwelling unit actually leased by a Family rather than the voucher unit
   size for which the Family qualifies using DCHA subsidy standards.

   5311.3. DCHA shall approve a utility allowance amount higher than shown on
   DCHA’s schedule if a higher allowance is needed as a reasonable
   accommodation for a Family member with a disability, in accordance with
   DCHA’s procedures regarding reasonable accommodation.

   5311.4. In the event of an interim recertification, DCHA shall use the current
   utility allowance schedule. Revised utility allowances shall be applied to a
   Family’s rent and subsidy calculations at the first regular recertification
   that is effective after the allowance is adopted.
