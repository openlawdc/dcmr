                                  DC REGULATIONS

UTILITY ALLOWANCE (§ 14-5332)

5332.1. If the Family pays for some or all utilities, DCHA shall provide the
   Family with a utility allowance. The allowances are based on actual rates and
   average consumption estimates, not on a Family&#8217;s actual energy
   consumption.  The utility allowance is given as a reduction in the Family’s
   portion of rent to be paid to the owner.

   5332.2. The Family’s share shall be the TTP minus an allowance for utilities
   based on income determinations as enumerated by 24 C.F.R. § 5.609 and 24
   C.F.R. § 5.611.

   5332.3. DCHA shall review the Utility Allowance Schedule on an annual basis. 
   If a revision is needed, based on methods required by HUD, the Utility
   Allowance Schedule shall be revised.

   5332.4. Approved utility allowance schedule(s) shall be given to families
   along with their Housing Voucher.  The same schedule(s) shall be used by DCHA
   to record the actual allowance for the unit the Family selects if there are
   Family-paid utilities.

   5332.5. Where the Utility Allowance exceeds the TTP of the Family, DCHA shall
   provide a Utility Reimbursement Payment on behalf of the Family each month.
