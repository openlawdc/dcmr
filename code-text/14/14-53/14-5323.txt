ACCEPTABILITY CRITERIA AND EXCEPTIONS TO HOUSING QUALITY STANDARDS (§ 14-5323)

5323.1. DCHA adheres to the acceptability criteria in the federal regulations
   and HUD Inspection Booklet to ensure the following systems are compliant with
   HQS:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Food preparation and refuse disposal;
   
   
   
   	(b)	Space and security;
   
   
   
   	(c)	Thermal environment;
   
   
   
   	(d)	Illumination and electricity;
   
   
   
   	(e)	Structure and materials;
   
   
   
   	(f)	Interior air quality;
   
   
   
   	(g)	Water supply;
   
   
   
   	(h)	Lead-based paint;
   
   
   
   	(i)	Site and neighborhood;
   
   
   
   	(j)	Sanitary conditions; and
   
   
   
   	(k)	Smoke detectors.

   5323.2. DCHA may grant a one hundred twenty (120) day extension to the HQS
   compliance regulations when severe weather prevents immediate repair as long
   as the deficiency does not create a hazardous condition.

   5323.3. All Housing Quality Standards Inspections shall be conducted in
   accordance with the standards contained in 24 C.F.R. § 982.401 except as
   noted below:
   
   
   
   	(a)	Utilities shall be turned on for the Housing Quality Standards inspection
   prior to the execution of a HAP Contract;
   
   
   
   	(b)	If the tenant is supplying the range or refrigerator, the working
   condition shall be verified at the time of the move in;
   
   
   
   	(c)	DCHA may fail the unit due to unsanitary conditions if exposed food,
   garbage, and excrement exist to a degree where health may be endangered;
   
   
   
   		(d)	Pilot lights which are present on gas stoves shall be in proper working
   order;
   
   
   
   		(e)	Trash bags shall not be considered &#8220;adequate covered
   facilities&#8221; for trash; and
   
   
   
   		(f)	Adequate heat shall be considered to be 65 degrees Fahrenheit (65°F)
   within three feet (3 ft.) of the floor and from an exterior wall for all rooms
   used for living.

   5323.4. Violations noted in the Housing Quality Standards that are marked as
   “Pass with Comments” violations will be considered minor violations. They
   must be repaired but will not be re-inspected on site; rather they will be
   subjected to a self-certification by the owner and tenant.

   5323.5. Lead-based paint requirements shall apply to dwelling units built
   prior to 1978 that are occupied or can be occupied by families with children
   less than six (6) years of age, excluding zero (0) bedroom dwellings.

   5323.6. For units occupied by children under six (6) with an elevated
   environmental intervention blood lead level (lead poisoned), a risk assessment
   shall be conducted. If lead hazards are identified during the risk assessment,
   the owner shall complete hazard reduction activities.  If the activities are
   not completed within thirty (30) days, the unit is deemed to be in violation
   of HQS.  Further guidance is contained in the Housing Choice Voucher
   Guidebook.

   5323.7. DCHA may make reasonable accommodations to HQS standards as necessary
   pursuant to § 4900.3.
