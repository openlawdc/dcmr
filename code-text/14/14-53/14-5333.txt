   twelve (12) month period unless one of the exceptions apply:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   A victim or Family seeks to move under the protections enumerated in the VAWA;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   DCHA terminates the HAP contract with the owner; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The move is necessary to grant a request for a reasonable accommodation.

   5333.4. Families may only request a Voucher transfer briefing if the Family:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Has lived in their unit for at least a year;

   Has not been terminated or is not currently being recommended for termination;

   (1) transfer voucher and one (1) transfer briefing between every biennial

   The family has demonstrated a need based on the protections for victims of
   intrafamily violence as explained in § 4907;
   
   
   
   DCHA has terminated the HAP contract with the Family’s landlord;
   
   
   
   The Owner has initiated eviction proceedings against the Family;
   
   
   
   Emergency transfer was granted after request from the OAG as a matter of
   safety; or
   
   
   
   If DCHA determines that the family voucher size is too large, and the family
   is not within the first year of tenancy.

   5333.7. Requests for transfer vouchers made within six (6) months before or
   after the month of biennial recertification shall be denied unless the Family

   requests the transfer voucher at the first or second biennial recertification
   appointment; or
   
   
   
   (b) 	qualifies for one (1) of the emergency conditions as stated in § 5334.6.
