   with the exception of the addition of a Family member as a result of birth,

   eligibility requirements at chapter 51 of this title of the DCMR.

   5316.3. DCHA shall only consider a request to add an adult to the Family
   composition under the following circumstances:
   
   
   
   (a)  	Marriage;
   
   
   
   (b) 	 If the adult is to be added as a live-in aide; or
   
   
   
   (c)  	As a reasonable accommodation.

   5316.4. Before DCHA’s approval can be finalized, the Family shall obtain the
   owner’s written approval to add a new Family member or a live-in aide.

   5316.5. If the owner declines to approve the addition of a new adult Family
   member, the Family will be issued a transfer voucher.  The new member will be

   unit.
   
   
   
   5316.6 	DCHA shall not add any Family members who claim citizenship or
