STORAGE OF ASHES, GARBAGE, AND REFUSE (§ 14-803)

803.1. In each multiple dwelling where the occupants of habitations are

   quarters to a place of common storage or disposal, the place of common storage
   or disposal shall be readily accessible to all occupants at all times through
   common space within the premises.

   803.2. In multiple dwellings where the owner or licensee is responsible for
   the collection or removal of ashes, garbage, or refuse from the individual
   habitations to a place of common storage or disposal, the owner or licensee
   shall cause sufficient daily collections, at an hour to be specified by the
   owner or licensee, to be made as may be necessary to keep the common space of
   the premises free from any accumulation of ashes, garbage, or refuse.

   803.3. The principal occupant of a single or two-family dwelling, and the
   owners or licensees of multiple dwellings, shall provide and maintain
   water-tight metal receptacles with tight-fitting metal covers sufficient for
   the separate storage of all ashes, garbage, or refuse accumulating on the
   premises during the usual interval between collections of the ashes, garbage,
   and refuse.

   803.4. If residential buildings are provided with interior refuse storage
   bins, the variety and number of those metal receptacles may be modified
   accordingly.

   803.5. Persons required by this section to provide and maintain storage
   receptacles shall keep them free of accumulated grease, filth, or insect
   breeding, and shall keep them in a clean condition.
