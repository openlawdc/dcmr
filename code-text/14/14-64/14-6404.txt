                                  DC REGULATIONS

DCHA TERMINATION OF TENANCY (§ 14-6404)

6404.1. DCHA shall not terminate the lease other than for serious or repeated
   violation of material terms of the lease. Violations of an obligation of
   tenancy refer only to those obligations which are contained in a valid,
   written lease or in the federal or local regulations pertaining to public
   housing tenants or in the D.C. Housing Code. There is no time limitation on
   bringing an action based on a breach of the lease.

   6404.2. If DCHA determines that a Lessee is in violation of the Dwelling
   Lease, except for lease violations predicated on the performance of an illegal
   act or non-payment of rent, the Lessee shall be issued a thirty (30) day
   notice to correct or vacate, stating in writing the violation(s) which
   provides the basis for the termination the lessee’s right to cure the
   violations and instructions on how to cure the violations.
   
   
   
   (a)	The notice shall inform the Lessee the applicability of his or her right
   to file an administrative complaint in accordance with Chapter 63 of this
   Title; and
   
   
   
   (b)	If a Lessee has filed a complaint requesting an administrative
   determination of his or her rights, in accordance with Chapter 63 of this
   Title, in response to service of a notice to correct or vacate or a notice of
   lease termination in the case of failure to pay rent and has not prevailed,
   the Lessee shall be issued a notice to vacate, as the time to cure has past
   and the Lessee shall be subject to legal action to gain possession of the unit
   (eviction).

   6404.3. The DCHA shall issue a thirty day (30) written notice to cure or
   vacate in the case of failure to pay rent.

   6404.4. DCHA shall issue a thirty (30) day notice to vacate to Lessees, for
   lease violations, predicated on criminal activity that threatens the residents
   health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of the Development or drug
   related criminal activity on or off the Leased Premises or the Development.

   6404.5. Pursuant to Section 6403, DCHA will not issue a thirty (30) day notice
   to correct or vacate, or notice to vacate, where DCHA has determined that the
   head of household responsible for the dwelling unit under the Dwelling lease
   is deceased and there are no remaining household members.

   6404.6. Lessees who refuse to vacate their unit after appropriate notice shall
   be subject to legal action to gain possession of the dwelling unit (eviction).

   6404.7. The Lessee shall be solely responsible for the protection, care and
   disposition of the Lessee’s possessions during, and after an eviction.

   6404.8. Where DCHA has excluded from its procedure any grievance concerning an
   eviction or termination of tenancy based on a Lessee’s creation or
   maintenance of a threat to the health or safety of other Lessees or DCHA
   employees, the Lessee against whom an eviction action has been filed in court
   shall be afforded the opportunity to examine all relevant documents, records,
   and regulations of DCHA prior to trial for the purpose of preparing a defense.

   6404.9. Any document not made available after request by the Lessee shall not
   be relied on by DCHA at the trial.
