7408.1. DCHA may, if necessary as a reasonable accommodation for an individual
   with a disability, approve a family’s request for an exception payment
   standard amount under the Housing Choice Voucher Program so that the program
   is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.

   7408.2. Upon request by an applicant, participant, or their representative,
   DCHA will ask the HUD Field Office for an exception payment standard up to
   120% of the Fair Market Rent (FMR). However, documentation of the need for the
   exception payment standard must be provided to DCHA by the applicant,
   participant or the representative.

   7408.3. In exceptional cases, DCHA may ask the Assistant Secretary for Public
   and Indian Housing of HUD for an exception payment standard amount over 120%
   of the FMR, provided documentation is provided by the applicant, participant
   or the representative.
