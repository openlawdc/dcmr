   4710.5. Low income tenants shall be required to furnish a listing of all
   income and assets from which an adjusted annual gross income will be
   determined using the deduction allowances cited in § 4710.4. This resulting
   figure shall be used to qualify a household as low-income by comparing it to
   current HUD Section 8 lower income limits for the appropriate-sized household.

   4710.6. The current HUD Section 8 limits shall be as follows (subject to
   change):
