   (a)	A copy of the association’s bylaws and membership list;
   
   
   
   (b)	A list of current tenants and corresponding unit numbers with an
   indication of those tenants who will remain after the conversion;

   (g)	A notarized statement attesting to the truthfulness of the information.

   4707.2. The Conversion and Sale Regulatory Office may issue an exemption from
   Title II of the Act if it appears that the conversion of the housing
   accommodation will not cause substantial displacement. The exemption shall
   indicate from which provisions of Title II of the Act the housing
   accommodation is exempt.

   4707.3. If the owner does not convert to a nonprofit cooperative, the owner
   shall immediately notify the Conversion and Sale Regulatory Office, and the
   exemption shall be void. The owner shall then comply with Title II of the Act.
