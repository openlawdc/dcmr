CONTRACT NEGOTIATION (ยง 14-4712)

4712.1. The tenant(s) and the owner shall bargain in good faith.

   4712.2. The following items shall constitute prima facie evidence of lack of
   good faith:
   
   
   
   (a)	The failure of an owner to offer the tenant(s) a price at least as
   favorable as that offered to a third party, within the time periods specified
   in the Act, without a reasonable justification;
   
   
   
   (b)	The failure of an owner to make a contract with the tenant(s) that
   substantially conforms with the price and terms of a third party, without
   reasonable justification, except where the Act may require otherwise; and
   
   
   
   (c)	The willful violation by a tenant or owner of the provisions of the Act.

   4712.3. The owner shall not require the tenants to pay a deposit of more than
   five percent (5%) of the contract sales price in order to make a contract. The
   deposit, with interest accrued thereon, shall be refundable in the event of a
   good faith failure of the tenants to perform under the contract.

   4712.4. The tenant(s) may assign his or her rights under Title IV of the Act
   to an agency or instrumentality of the District of Columbia or federal
   government.

   4712.5. The tenant(s) may exercise rights under the Act in conjunction with a
   third party to aid in the purchase.

   4712.6. A tenant or tenant organization shall have the right of first refusal
   for fifteen (15) days after the owner has notified the tenant organization of
   receipt of a valid sales contract from a third party. The owner shall notify
   the tenant(s) of such contract or offer.

   4712.7. If the third party contract is received before or during the tenant
   negotiation period, the fifteen (15) day right of first refusal shall come at
   the end of the negotiation period. If the third party contract is received
   after the tenant negotiation period, the fifteen (15) day right of first
   refusal shall begin when the tenants receive notice.
