   housing accommodation at least one hundred twenty (120) days notice of intent

   form approved by the Conversion and Sale Regulatory Office, and shall set
   forth the rights of tenants and subtenants pursuant to the Act.

   an owner has requested an election pursuant to § 4701.

   4705.3. The one hundred twenty (120) day notice of intent to convert shall be
   sent by first class mail to each tenant or subtenant, and copies shall be
   submitted to the Conversion and Sale Regulatory Office.

   as favorable as those being offered by the owner to the general public.

   4705.6. If the notice of intent to convert specifies a date by which the
   apartment unit shall be vacated, then the notice shall constitute and be the

   the notice and the tenant or subtenant has received a full sixty (60) days to
