                                  DC REGULATIONS

CONVERSION OF THE HOUSING ACCOMMODATION (§ 14-4704)

4704.1. Within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of the confirmation of
   the results of an election pursuant to § 4703.1 or a verification in lieu of
   election under § 4702.16, the owner shall pay the conversion fee under §
   4704.6.

   4704.2. If the owner is a tenant organization, the conversion fee may be paid
   at settlement on the individual shares or units pursuant to § 202(a) of the
   Act.

   4704.3. The Conversion and Sale Regulatory Office shall certify compliance
   within ten (10) business days of receipt of the conversion fee. A
   certification of compliance expires at the close of business one hundred
   eighty (180) days after issuance, or close of business on the next business
   day, if the one hundred and eightieth (180) day falls on a weekend or holiday.

   4704.4. If the owner does not convert during the one hundred eighty (180) day
   period, the owner may not request another election for one (1) year from the
   date of expiration.

   4704.5. An owner may request an extension by application to the Conversion and
   Sale Regulatory Office. The application shall contain the notarized consents
   of more than fifty percent (50%) of the qualified voters, the reason for
   extension, the anticipated timing of the conversion, and a sworn statement as
   to the truthfulness of the information provided. Any extension shall not
   exceed ninety (90) days. There shall be no more than two (2) extensions per
   election.

   4704.6. The owner shall pay a conversion fee representing four percent (4%) of
   the anticipated sales price for each unit or a reduced fee in accordance with
   § 4704.9.

   4704.7. An owner may request a reduction of the conversion fee if the owner
   declares an intent to sell or lease units or shares to at least fifty-one
   percent (51%) of the nonelderly low income tenants.

   4704.8. To qualify for a reduction under this section, a lease shall be for at
   least five (5) years at existing rent plus any annual increases allowed by the
   Rental Housing Act of 1977, as amended (D.C. Law 2-54), and its successor
   legislation or twenty-five percent (25%) of gross household income, whichever
   is greater. For an intent to sell to qualify as a basis for reduction of the
   fee, the unit price and terms shall provide an opportunity for the low-income
   tenant to purchase.

   4704.9. After reviewing an owner’s request for reduction of the conversion
   fee, the Conversion and Sale Regulatory Office may reduce the fee as follows:

   4704.10. Tenants who have a right to a statutory tenancy shall not be included
   in the percentage of low-income tenant determination.

   4704.11. The owners shall provide copies of Recorder of Deeds Form FP-2
   reflecting the price of each unit or share sold, or a copy of the share which
   indicates the price thereof, within five (5) business days after settlement.

   4704.12. When the condominium or cooperative is sold out, the owner shall
   submit a final accounting of units or shares sold or leased. If the owner
   qualified for reduction of the conversion fee, then the final accounting shall
   show that the reduction was justified. The final accounting shall be signed
   and notarized.

   4704.13. If an owner sells a unit or share for less than the declared price,
   the owner may apply to the Conversion and Sale Regulatory Office for a refund.
   An application for refund shall be made when the owner supplies a copy of the
   settlement form for that unit or share.

   4704.14. If an owner sells a unit or share for more than the declared price,
   or fails to justify the reduction in fee, the additional amount shall be paid
   at settlement. If the additional amount is not paid at settlement, it shall
   become a lien on the property. The Conversion and Sale Regulatory Office shall
   so notify the Office of the Recorder of Deeds and the Office of Tax and
   Revenue.

   4704.15. If a property that would be subject to a lien pursuant to § 4704.14
   is sold to a low income tenant, the Conversion and Sale Regulatory Office may
   waive attachment of lien.

   4704.16. Any owner of a unit converted pursuant to Title II of the Act rented
   to any low-income tenant or low-income elderly tenant is eligible for property
   tax abatement. Upon request from the owner, the Conversion and Sale Regulatory
   Office shall certify to the Office of Tax and Revenue that the owner qualifies
   for a tax abatement.

   4704.17. Occupancy during any portion of a year will be sufficient to qualify
   for tax abatement for that year.

   4704.18. A request for tax abatement shall include the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	The name and unit number;
   
   
   
   (b)	The address and telephone number of the low income tenant;
