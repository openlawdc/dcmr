   Income and the total income of any other non-AYBL participant(s) in the
   household, if any.  In the event that the amount calculated is less than zero
   dollars ($0), the rent charged will be zero dollars ($0).
   
   
   
   9812.2    	At all Rewards Properties, DCHA will initially pay for all unit

   following is the graduated schedule of utility payment responsibility that

   pay utilities pursuant to this Section; however, failure to pay utilities is a
   violation of the Contract of Participation; as such, the AYBL Family is
   subject to termination from the AYBL program.
