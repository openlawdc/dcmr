                                  DC REGULATIONS

MOVE-IN AND MOVE-OUT INSPECTIONS (§ 14-9811)

9811.1   	Prior to the move-in date, DCHA shall conduct a move-in inspection
with the AYBL Family.  At the end of the inspection, DCHA and the AYBL Family
shall sign the unit inspection form certifying the condition of the unit, and
the equipment provided with the unit. The AYBL Family cannot contest any
deficiency not included on the move-in inspection form.



9811.2  	AYBL Families are required to notify DCHA in writing thirty (30) days
prior to vacating the unit.  Failure to provide a thirty (30) day written
notice will permit DCHA to charge the tenant with an additional month’s rent
and may result in forfeiture of all or part of the security deposit.



9811.3   	The DCHA shall conduct a move-out inspection with the AYBL Family
prior to the scheduled move-out date. If the AYBL Family vacates the unit
without notifying DCHA, DCHA shall inspect the unit within twenty-four (24)
hours of becoming aware of the family vacating the unit.



9811.4   	The security deposit will be treated in accordance with the DCHA
Dwelling Lease Agreement.  Except that, in the event the tenant caused damages
exceed the amount of the security deposit, DCHA may deduct the balance due from
the savings escrow or take any other action allowable by D.C. law.



9811.5 	DCHA shall furnish the vacated AYBL Family with a statement of total
charges and any deductions from the security deposit and/or escrow accounts for
any damages within thirty (30) calendar days after completion of repairs.
