PROGRAM DESCRIPTION (§ 14-9801)

9801.1. The District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA) recognizes the need
   to encourage families in their efforts to attain self-sufficiency.  As such,
   DCHA establishes the Achieving Your Best Life Rewards Program (AYBL), a
   self-sufficiency program structured around DCHA designated Public Housing
   developments known as Rewards Properties.  Participating AYBL Families reside
   at these developments while preparing to become homeowners.  Although the
   primary goal of the program is to prepare public housing families to become
   homeowners by reducing their dependency on public and housing subsidies,
   families also set self-declared goals related to achieving homeownership.  In
   an effort to assist families to become homeowners, DCHA’s goal is to connect
   residents with available resources and services in such areas as credit and
   budget counseling, general life skills, job readiness assessment and training,
   home ownership counseling, educational/vocational training and self
   improvement workshops. Through case management and active participation,
   families will be connected with community services and related programs
   critical to their success. Participation in the AYBL program is voluntary.
