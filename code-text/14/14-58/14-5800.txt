                                  DC REGULATIONS

GENERAL POLICY (ยง 14-5800)

5800.1. DCHA takes several steps to avoid recommending participant families
   and Owners for termination from the Program.  Prior to making a Recommendation
   for Termination (RFT), DCHA will provide notice to the affected party/parties
   that includes a description of the violation, an explanation that failure to
   correct the violation may result in a recommendation for termination, and
   instructions on what must be done to correct the violation.

   5800.2. Before DCHA makes a recommendation for termination, there are several
   opportunities for a Family or Owner to cure or explain the circumstances
   surrounding the violation.  These include:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Walk-in Appointment days;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Scheduled informal meetings; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   Reviewing reasonable accommodation requests that pertain to the recommendation
   for termination.
