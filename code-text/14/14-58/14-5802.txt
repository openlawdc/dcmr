                                  DC REGULATIONS

GROUNDS FOR OWNER TERMINATION OF TENANCY (§ 14-5802)

5802.1. The Owner is not permitted to terminate a participant Family’s
   tenancy except for serious or repeated violations of the lease, certain
   violations of state or local law as set forth in § 5802.3, or other good
   cause as governed by federal and local laws.

   5802.2. The Owner may terminate the Family’s tenancy for serious or repeated
   violations of the terms and conditions of the lease, including failure to pay
   rent, except when the violations are related to an incident or incidents of
   actual or threatened intrafamily offenses, sexual violence, dating violence,
   elder abuse, or stalking against the participant or an immediate Family member
   or when the Owner fails to reasonably accommodate the disability of a Family
   member. DCHA’s failure to make a HAP payment to the Owner is not a violation
   of the lease between the Family and the Owner.

   5802.3. The Owner is permitted to terminate the tenancy if a fact-finder
   determines that a Family member has violated federal, state, or local law that
   imposes obligations in connection with the occupancy or use of the premises
   and the proper issuance and execution of a writ of restitution takes place.

   5802.4. Any Owner termination of tenancy must be consistent with the District
   of Columbia Rental Housing Act and any other D.C. law governing
   landlord-tenant relations.

   5802.5. DCHA may permit, at its discretion, Owners and participants to
   terminate a lease within the first twelve (12) months of tenancy if both
   parties agree.  Written requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis
   and may be granted as a reasonable accommodation, or if DCHA determines
   termination is necessary.
