                                  DC REGULATIONS

OWNER NOTICE TO VACATE (§ 14-5801)

5801.1. During or any time after the first term of the lease, the Owner shall
   use legal means to evict the Family pursuant to the District of Columbia
   Rental Housing Act and applicable federal law.  Service of a notice to vacate
   which does not comply with the lease and local or federal laws is not
   sufficient to evict a tenant.

   5801.2. Where there is any conflict between the terms of a lease and federal
   or local law, federal or local law shall prevail.

   5801.3. Eviction of a Family by the Owner shall not, in and of itself,
   constitute a violation of a Family’s obligations under the Program.  DCHA
   shall not terminate Program assistance based solely on the fact that a Family
   has been evicted from a property.

   5801.4. A Family who has been evicted shall be issued a transfer voucher to
   move to another unit, unless there are other valid grounds, as outlined in
   local regulations, to deny issuance of a transfer voucher.
