                                  DC REGULATIONS

EXEMPTIONS TO VOUCHER SIZE (§ 14-5206)

5206.1. In determining the Voucher size for a particular Family, DCHA may
   grant an exception to the subsidy standards set forth in § 5205 if DCHA
   determines that the exception is justified by the age, sex, gender identity,
   health, or disability of one (1) or more of the Family members.

   5206.2. For a single person who is not elderly, disabled, or a remaining
   Family member as explained in § 5317.8, an exception cannot override the
   regulatory limit of a one (1) bedroom unit.

   5206.3. The Family shall request any exceptions to the Voucher sizes in
   writing to DCHA.  The request shall explain the need or justification for a
   larger Family unit size, and shall include appropriate documentation.  Family
   requests based on health-related reasons shall be verified by a knowledgeable
   professional source (such as a doctor or health professional).

   5206.4. DCHA shall notify the Family of its determination within thirty (30)
   days of receiving the Family’s request for an exception. If a participant
   Family’s request is denied, the notice shall inform the Family of their
   right to an informal hearing under 89 of this title of the DCMR.
