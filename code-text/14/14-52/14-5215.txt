   5215.2. Any appliance, service, or other item which is routinely provided to
   nonsubsidized tenants as part of the lease (such as air conditioning,
   dishwasher, or garage) or are permanently installed in the unit cannot be put

   a separate agreement, the tenant shall have the option of not utilizing the
   service, appliance, or other item.

   5215.3. DCHA is not liable for unpaid charges for items covered by separate
   agreements and nonpayment of these agreements cannot be cause for eviction.

   5215.4. If the tenant and owner have come to an agreement on the amount of
   Charges for a specific item, so long as those charges are reasonable and not a
   substitute for higher rent, they shall be allowed. Costs for seasonal items
   can be spread out over twelve (12) months.

   5215.5. Copies of all separate agreements shall be provided to DCHA.
