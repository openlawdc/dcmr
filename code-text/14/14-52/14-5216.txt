OWNER LEASE APPROVAL (§ 14-5216)

5216.1. DCHA shall not review the owner’s lease for compliance with
   state/local law. It is the owner’s responsibility to comply with state/local
   law when leasing units on the owner’s property.

   5216.2. The assisted dwelling lease shall contain all of the required
   information as listed below:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The names of the owner and the tenant:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The unit rented (address, apartment number, and any other information needed
   to identify the contract unit);
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The term of the lease (initial term and any provisions for renewal);
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   The amount of the monthly rent to owner; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   A specification of what utilities and appliances are to be supplied by the
   owner, and what utilities and appliances are to be supplied by the Family.

   5216.3. The initial term of the assisted dwelling lease shall be for at least
   one (1) year. DCHA may approve a shorter initial lease term as a reasonable
   accommodation to the Family.

   5216.4. This written lease is a contract between the tenant Family and the
   owner; DCHA is not a party to this contract.

   5216.5. All provisions in the HUD-required Tenancy Addendum shall also be
   added word-for-word to the owner&#8217;s standard lease form, for use with the
   assisted Family. As a part of the lease, the tenant shall have the right to
   enforce the Tenancy Addendum against the owner and the terms of the Tenancy
   Addendum shall prevail over any other provisions of the lease.
