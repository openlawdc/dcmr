   requirements and responsibilities under the HCVP.

   and the owner shall provide a copy to DCHA with signatures. DCHA shall ensure
   that both the owner and the assisted Family receive copies of the dwelling
   lease.

   5217.3. The owner and DCHA shall execute the HAP contract with notarized
   signatures. DCHA shall not execute the HAP contract until the owner has
   submitted IRS form W-9. DCHA shall ensure that the owner receives a copy of
   the executed HAP contract.
