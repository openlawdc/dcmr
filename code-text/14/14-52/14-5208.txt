VOUCHER ISSUANCE (§ 14-5208)

5208.1. After an applicant Family has been deemed eligible, selected from the
   waiting list, and attended an oral briefing, DCHA shall issue a Voucher to the
   Family.

   5208.3. The initial term of the Voucher shall be one hundred eighty (180)
   calendar days. The Family shall submit HUD Form-52517, Request for Tenancy
   Approval (RTA) or RTA package, within the one hundred eighty (180) calendar
   days.

   5208.4. Upon the Family’s submission of a RTA package and proposed lease,
   the initial term of the Voucher shall be suspended until the unit passes or
   fails Housing Quality Standards (HQS) inspection.

   5208.5. DCHA shall document the suspension of the Voucher term following the
   submission of an RTA package and shall provide the Family written notice of
   suspension by first class mail.  The notice shall include the specific date
   that the suspension takes effect.  If DCHA subsequently lifts the suspension
   of the Voucher because the unit is not approved, DCHA shall provide written
   notice to the tenant by first class mail and specify the new expiration date
   of the voucher term.

   5208.6. Extensions to the initial term of a Voucher shall be granted for a
   period necessary to reasonably accommodate a Family member whose disability
   has interfered with his or her ability to find housing, in accordance with
   federal and local law.
