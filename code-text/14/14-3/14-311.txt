INTEREST ON SECURITY DEPOSIT ESCROW ACCOUNTS (§ 14-311)

311.1. The interest in the escrow account described in § 309 on all money
   paid by the tenant prior to or during the tenancy as a security deposit,
   decorating fee, or similar deposit or fee, shall commence on the date the
   money is actually paid by the tenant, or within thirty (30) days after
   February 20, 1976, whichever is later, and shall accrue at not less than the
   statement savings rate then prevailing on January 1st and on July 1st for each
   6-month period (or part thereof) of the tenancy which follows those dates. On
   those dates, the statement savings rate in the District of Columbia financial
   institution in which the escrow account is held shall be used. All interest
   earned shall accrue to the tenant except for that described in paragraph
   (4)(a-1) or as set forth in paragraph (2) (14 DCMR § 309).

   311.2. Interest on an escrow account shall be due and payable by the owner to
   the tenant upon termination of any tenancy of a duration of twelve (12) months
   or more, unless an amount is deducted under procedures set forth in paragraph
   (2) (14 DCMR §§ 309.1 and 309.2). Any housing provider violating the
   provisions of this section by failing to pay interest on a security deposit
   escrow account that is rightfully owed to a tenant in accordance with the
   requirements of this section, shall be liable to the Rent Administrator or
   Rental Housing Commission, as applicable, for the amount of the interest owed,
   or in the event of bad faith, for treble that amount. For the purposes of this
   paragraph, the term &#8220;bad faith&#8221; means any frivolous or unfounded
   refusal to return a security deposit, as required by law, that is motivated by
   a fraudulent, deceptive, misleading, dishonest, or unreasonably self-serving
   purpose and not by simple negligence, bad judgment, or an honest belief in the
   course of action taken. Any housing provider who willfully violates the
   provisions of this section by failing to pay interest on a security deposit
   escrow account that is rightfully owed to a tenant in accordance with the
   requirements of this section shall be subject to a civil fine of not more than
   $ 5000 for each violation.
   
   
   
   (1)	If the housing provider invests the security deposit in an account with an
   interest rate that exceeds that of the statement savings rate as required in
   subparagraph (a)(14) (14 DCMR § 311.1), the housing provider may apply up to
   30% of the excess interest for administrative costs or other purposes.

   311.3. Except in cases where no interest is paid to the tenant as provided in
   § 311.2, the owner shall not assign the account or use it as security for
   loans.

   311.4. It is the intent of this section that the account referred to in this
   section and § 309 shall be used solely for the purpose of securing the
   lessees’ performance under the lease.

   311.5. This section and § 309 and § 310 shall not be subject to the notice
   requirements of any other section of this subtitle.
