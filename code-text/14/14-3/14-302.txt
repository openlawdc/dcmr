VOIDING LEASE FOR VIOLATION OF REGULATIONS (§ 14-302)

302.1. The leasing of any habitation which, at the beginning of the tenancy,
   is unsafe or unsanitary due to violations of this subtitle in that habitation
   or in the common space of the premises (whether or not those violations are
   the subject of a notice issued under this subtitle) of which the owner has
   knowledge or reasonably should have knowledge, shall render void the lease or
   rental agreement for the habitation.

   302.2. After the beginning of the tenancy, if the habitation becomes unsafe or
   unsanitary due to violations of this subtitle in that habitation or in the
   common space of the premises (whether or not the violations are the subject of
   a notice issued under this subtitle), the lease or rental agreement for the
   habitation shall be rendered void if both of the following apply:
   
   
   
   (a)	The violations did not result from the intentional acts or negligence of
   the tenant or his or her invitees; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The violations are not corrected within the time allowed for correction
   under a notice issued under this subtitle (or, if a notice has not been
   issued, within a reasonable time after the owner has knowledge or reasonably
   should have knowledge of the violations).
