   (1)	Tender payment to the tenant, without demand, any security deposit and any
   similar payment paid by the tenant as a condition of tenancy in addition to
   the stipulated rent, and any interest due the tenant on that deposit or
   payment as provided in paragraph (4)(a) and (a-1) (14 DCMR § 311); or
   
   
   
   (2)	Notify the tenant in writing, to be delivered to the tenant personally or
   by certified mail at the tenant&#8217;s last known address, of the
   owner&#8217;s intention to withhold and apply the monies toward defraying the
   cost of expenses properly incurred under the terms and conditions of the
   security deposit agreement.

   309.2. The owner, within 30 days after notification to the tenant pursuant to
   the requirement of paragraph (2)(a)(2) (14 DCMR § 309.1(b)), shall tender a
   refund of the balance of the deposit or payment, including interest not used

   the cost of each repair or other use.

   309.3. Failure by the owner to comply with § 309.1 and § 309.2 of this

   payment made by the tenant as security for performance of his or her
   obligations or as a condition of tenancy, in addition to the stipulated rent.

   309.4. Failure by the owner to serve the tenant personally or by certified
   mail, after good faith effort to do so, shall not constitute a failure by the
