                                  DC REGULATIONS

VETERANS AFFAIRS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING – SPECIAL PROGRAM RULES (§ 14-4904)

4904.1. Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) vouchers are generally
   administered in accordance with the HCVP tenant-based rental assistance
   regulations set forth at 24 C.F.R. § 982, the DCMR, and this Administrative
   Plan.

   4904.2. To be HUD-VASH eligible, a family must include at least one homeless
   veteran.  Section 8(o)(19) of the United States Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C.
   § 1437f(o)(19) (2006)  requires homeless veterans to have chronic mental
   illnesses or chronic substance use disorders with treatment of these disorders
   required as a condition of receipt of HUD-VASH assistance.  This requirement
   shall be waived for the VASH program.

   4904.3. HUD has prescribed additional operating requirements for this program
   which DCHA shall follow.  Those additional requirements can be found in
   Department of Housing and Urban Development, Section 8 Housing Choice
   Vouchers: Implementation of the HUD-VA Supportive Housing Program, Docket No.
   FR-5211-N-01.

   4904.4. Pursuant to the guidance issued by HUD, if DCHA recommends a VASH
   participant for termination, DCHA may first consult with the VASH
   participant’s case manager prior to terminating to discuss the reasons for
   terminating and discuss whether termination can be avoided.

   4904.5. If HUD waives or specifies alternative requirements in connection with
   the VASH Program, DCHA shall incorporate these changes in the administration
   of the VASH Program where applicable.

   4904.6. Upon turnover, HUD-VASH vouchers shall be issued to eligible families
   as identified by the Veterans Affair Medical Center (VAMC).

   4904.7. If a HUD-VASH voucher participant no longer requires case management
   by VAMC, he or she may qualify to receive a voucher under the regular HCVP.
   DCHA has allotted a certain number of vouchers specifically for veterans in
   this situation.

   4904.8. VAMC shall be responsible for maintaining lists of eligible veterans
   requesting a voucher who do not qualify for case management.
