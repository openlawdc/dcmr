                                  DC REGULATIONS

REPAYMENT AGREEMENTS GENERALLY (ยง 14-5602)

5602.1. A Repayment Agreement is a document entered into between DCHA and a
   Head of Household or an owner who owes a debt to DCHA. It is similar to a
   promissory note, but contains more details regarding the nature of the debt,
   the terms of payment, special provisions, and the remedies available to DCHA
   upon default of the Agreement.

   5602.2. The minimum monthly payment under a repayment agreement shall be
   negotiated on a case-by-case basis between DCHA and the participant Family or
   owner.

   5602.3. The goal of any repayment agreement shall be to establish reasonable
   monthly payments such that the participant can remain in the program so long
   as he or she complies with the terms of the repayment agreement.

   5602.4. The circumstances in which DCHA may decline to enter into a Repayment
   Agreement include, but are not limited to, any of the following:
   
   
   
   If the participant Family or owner already has a Repayment Agreement in place;
   
   
   
   If DCHA determines that the Family or owner:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   committed program fraud;
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   intentionally withheld information; or
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   intentionally provided false information; or
   
   
   
   If the Family already has a Repayment Agreement in place and incurs an
   additional debt to DCHA, any old debts to DCHA shall be paid in full before
   DCHA enters into a new Repayment Agreement.
