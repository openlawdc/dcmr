GENERAL PROVISIONS (§ 14-2600)

2600.1. The Cooperative Conversion Seed Money Loan Program provides assistance
   to low-income and moderate-income tenant groups with a high potential for
   successful cooperative conversion. The assistance will be in the form of
   non-interest-bearing loans to help defray certain up-front costs of
   cooperative conversion.

   2600.2. The loans under this program shall assist in the prevention of
   displacement by enabling tenant associations to exercise their right to
   purchase properties in which they are renters, where those properties are for
   sale.

   2600.3. Priority for loan assistance shall be given to tenant associations
   selected for technical assistance under the Apartment Improvement Program of
   the Department of Housing and Community Development (also referred to in this
   chapter as the “Department” or “DHCD”), where cooperative conversion
   is part of an agreed upon improvement plan for the building.
