VACANCY RENT CEILING ADJUSTMENTS (§ 14-4207)

4207.1. A vacancy rent ceiling adjustment, authorized by § 213(a) of the Act,
   is an increase in the rent ceiling for a previously registered rental unit
   that may be taken and perfected by a housing provider for a rental unit that
   became vacant under the conditions set forth in § 213(a) of the Act, but
   subject to the limitation of § 4207.3.

   4207.2. The amount of a rent ceiling increase that a housing provider may take
   and perfect under § 213(a) of the Act shall be one of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Twelve percent (12%) of the previously authorized rent ceiling for the
   unit; provided, that no other twelve percent (12%) vacancy rent ceiling
   adjustment has been taken and perfected for the rental unit under this
   subchapter within the immediately preceding twelve (12) month period; or
   
   
   
   (b)	The amount required to increase the rent ceiling for the rental unit to
   equal the rent ceiling of a previously registered, substantially identical
   rental unit in the same housing accommodation as specified in § 4207.4.

   4207.3. Notwithstanding § 4207.1, a housing provider shall not take and
   perfect a rent ceiling adjustment authorized by § 213(a) of the Act (a
   vacancy adjustment) within the twelve (12) month period following the date of
   perfection of any rent ceiling adjustment for the rental unit under § 212 of
   the Act.

   4207.4. For the purposes of § 4207.2(b), a “substantially identical rental
   unit” is a rental unit that meets the following requirements:
   
   
   
   (a)	Is subject to the Rent Stabilization Program of the Act (is not exempt
   under § 205(a) or excluded under § 205(e));
   
   
   
   (b)	Has essentially the same floor plan, square footage, comparable amenities
   and equipment, comparable location with respect to exposure and height (if
   exposure and height have previously determined rent), and is in comparable
   physical condition as the rental unit whose rent ceiling is being adjusted;
   and
   
   
   
   (c)	Is located in the same building or in a similar building within the same
   housing accommodation or multi-building housing complex.

   4207.5. A housing provider who so elects shall take and perfect a vacancy rent
   ceiling adjustment in the manner set forth in § 4204.10, and the date of
   perfection shall be the date on which the housing provider satisfies the
   notice requirements of § 4101.6.

   4207.6. Where a housing provider increases the rent for a rental unit to an
   amount equal to or less than the rent ceiling adjustment permitted by §
   4207.1, the housing provider shall comply with the provisions of §§ 4205.4
   and 4205.5, and the notices required by §§ 4101.6 and 4205.4(a)	may be
   issued simultaneously to the affected tenant on a form of notice approved by
   the Rent Administrator.
