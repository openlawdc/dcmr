   of the tenants in a housing accommodation and the housing provider, the Rent
   Administrator shall approve the voluntary agreement within forty-five (45)
   days of its submission; provided, that the Rent Administrator shall provide a
   reasonable opportunity for tenants with objections to submit the objections in
   writing.

   4213.14. If the Rent Administrator does not approve or disapprove the

   been approved by seventy percent (70%) of the tenants only in the following
