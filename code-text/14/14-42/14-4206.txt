   unit.

   4206.3. A housing provider may take and perfect a rent ceiling adjustment of
   general applicability only once in any twelve (12) month period, and a housing
   provider who elects to perfect a rent ceiling adjustment for a rental unit
   under § 206(b) of the Act shall not be eligible to take and perfect another
   such adjustment during the twelve (12) month period immediately following the
   date of perfection of the prior adjustment of general applicability.

   4206.4. A housing provider who so elects shall take and perfect a rent ceiling
   adjustment of general applicability in the manner set forth in § 4204.10, and
