BASE RENT[COLON] APRIL 30, 1985 RENT CEILINGS (§ 14-4201)

4201.1. The “base rent” for each rental unit covered by the Rent
   Stabilization Program on the effective date of the Act shall be the rent
   ceiling for the unit as of April 30, 1985, pursuant to § 103(4) of the Act.

   4201.2. Except as provided in §§ 4201.3 and 4201.4, the base rent for each
   rental unit shall be established by determining the actual rent charged for
   the unit on September 1, 1983, adjusted to reflect the amount of each rent
   ceiling increase properly taken and perfected prior to September 1, 1983,
   under the Rental Housing Act of 1980 and regulations promulgated thereunder;
   any prior rent control law and the regulations, if any, promulgated
   thereunder; or pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction;
   provided, that the adjustment called for in this paragraph shall not include
   any portion of a prior rent ceiling increase which was the basis for a rent
   increase already included in the actual rent charged on September 1, 1983.

   4201.3. If a rental unit was vacant on September 1, 1983, or no rent was
   actually charged on that date, the base rent of that unit shall be established
   by applying the adjustments called for in § 4201.2 to the rent actually
   charged for the unit on the first day of the month immediately preceding
   September 1, 1983, during which rent was charged.

   4201.4. If a rental unit that is subject to the Rent Stabilization Program of
   the Rental Housing Act of 1980 was first occupied as a rental unit after
   September 1, 1983 but before May 1, 1985, the base rent for that unit shall be
   the rent charged or chargeable for the unit during the initial leasing period
   when the unit was occupied after September 1, 1983.

   4201.5. The rent ceiling for each rental unit covered by the Rent
   Stabilization Program of the Act on the effective date of the Act shall be
   determined by adding to the base rent for the unit established under §§
   4201.2, 4201.3 or 4201.4 the amount of each rent ceiling adjustment taken and
   perfected or ordered to be taken after September 1, 1983 but before May 1,
   1985, pursuant to any of the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	A judicial decision or order of any court of competent jurisdiction;
   
   
   
   (b)	An administrative decision of the Rent Administrator or the Commission
   (including decisions of the Rental Accommodations Commissions) issued in
   adjudication of a petition to adjust the rent ceiling under §§ 211, 212,
   213, 215, or 217 of the Rental Housing Act of 1980 or any prior rent control
   law;
   
   
   
   (c)	A rent ceiling adjustment of general applicability authorized by § 207(b)
   of the Rental Housing Act of 1980;
   
   
   
   (d)	A rent ceiling adjustment for a vacant rental unit authorized by § 214 of
   the Rental Housing Act of 1980;
   
   
   
   (e)	A rent ceiling adjustment established by a voluntary agreement approved by
   the Rent Administrator under § 216 of the Rental Housing Act of 1980.

   4201.6. Regardless of the date of initial registration of a rental unit under
   the Act, no rent ceiling adjustment taken and perfected or ordered to be taken
   after April 30, 1985, shall be applied as an adjustment under § 4201.5 for
   the purpose of establishing the rent ceiling for the unit on April 30, 1985.
