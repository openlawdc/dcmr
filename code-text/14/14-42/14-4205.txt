                                  DC REGULATIONS

RENT INCREASES AND DECREASES (§ 14-4205)

4205.1. If the rent for a rental unit on or after the effective date of the
   Act exceeds the authorized rent ceiling for the rental unit, the housing
   provider shall promptly implement a rent reduction to an amount equal to, or
   less than, the authorized rent ceiling.

   4205.2. If the rent for a rental unit on or after the effective date of the
   Act is less than the authorized rent ceiling for the rental unit, the housing
   provider, unless otherwise prohibited by the Act, may implement a rent
   increase to an amount equal to, or less than, the authorized rent ceiling.

   4205.3. A housing provider may charge as rent for a rental unit an amount less
   than the authorized rent ceiling without waiving or forfeiting the right to
   later implement a rent increase in compliance with § 4205.5 to an amount
   equal to, or less than, the authorized rent ceiling; provided, that the
   housing provider has first taken and perfected all prior rent ceiling
   adjustments which establish the rent ceiling in accordance with §§ 4204.9
   and 4204.10.

   4205.4. A housing provider shall implement a rent adjustment by taking the
   following actions, and no rent adjustment shall be deemed properly implemented
   unless the following actions have been taken:
   
   
   
   (a)	The housing provider shall provide the tenant of the rental unit not less
   than thirty (30) days written notice, pursuant to § 904 of the Act, in which
   the following items shall be included:
   
   
   
   (1)	The amount of the rent adjustment;
   
   
   
   (2)	The amount of the adjusted rent;
   
   
   
   (3)	The date upon which the adjusted rent shall be due; and
   
   
   
   (4)	The date and authorization for the rent ceiling adjustment taken and
   perfected pursuant to § 4204.9;
   
   
   
   (b)	The housing provider shall certify to the tenant, with the notice of rent
   adjustment, that the rental unit and the common elements of the housing
   accommodations are in substantial compliance with the housing regulations or,
   if not in substantial compliance, that any noncompliance is the result of
   tenant neglect or misconduct;
   
   
   
   (c)	The housing provider shall advise the tenant with the notice of rent
   adjustment by petition filed with the Rent Administrator; and
   
   
   
   (d)	The housing provider shall simultaneously file with the Rent Administrator
   a sample copy of the notice of rent adjustment along with an affidavit
   containing the names, unit numbers, date and type of service provided,
   certifying that the notice was served on all affected tenants in the housing
   accommodation.

   4205.5. Notwithstanding § 4205.4, a housing provider shall not implement a
   rent adjustment for a rental unit unless all of the following conditions are
   met:
   
   
   
   (a)	The rental unit and the common elements of the housing accommodation are
   in substantial compliance with the D.C. housing regulations, or any
   substantial noncompliance is the result of tenant neglect or misconduct;
   
   
   
   (b)	The housing provider has met the registration requirements of § 4102 with
   respect to the rental unit; and
   
   
   
   (c)	At least one hundred eighty (180) days shall have elapsed since the date
   of implementation of any prior rent increase.

   4205.6. The rent that a housing provider may charge for a unit may be
   decreased by order of the Rent Administrator without at the same time reducing
   the rent ceiling, upon adjudication of a petition filed by one (1) or more
   tenants under § 216 of the Act for any of the following reasons:
   
   
   
   (a)	To seek relief from, or compensation for, any unlawful rent increase; or
   
   
   
   (b)	To seek relief from, or compensation for, the existence of prolonged
   housing code violations.

   4205.7. Unless otherwise ordered by the Rent Administrator, each adjustment in
   rent charged may not exceed the amount of one (1) rent ceiling increase
   perfected but not implemented by the housing provider.

   4205.8. If the difference between the rent ceiling and the rent charged for
   the rental unit consists of all or a portion of one (1) previously
   unimplemented rent ceiling adjustment, the housing provider may elect to
   implement all or a portion of the difference.

   4205.9. Nothing in the Act or this chapter shall be construed to prevent a
   housing provider, at the housing provider’s election, from delaying for any
   period of time the implementation of any rent ceiling adjustment or from
   implementing less than the full amount of any rent ceiling adjustment.

   4205.10. Any rent ceiling adjustment, or portion thereof, which remains
   unimplemented shall not expire and shall not be deemed forfeited or otherwise
   diminished.
