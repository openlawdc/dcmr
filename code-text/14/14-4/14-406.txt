SUBDIVISION OF HABITABLE ROOMS (§ 14-406)

406.1. No habitable room shall be divided in any manner into space intended
   for living, sleeping, eating, or cooking purposes by an installed partition or
   divider of any type above four feet (4 ft.) in height, unless each such
   subdivided part complies with the requirements for a habitable room, except as
   otherwise provided in this section.

   406.2. The enclosure of cabinet-type kitchenettes by doors or other closing
   devices, where those kitchenettes are too small to be occupied when the doors
   or other closing devices are closed in a normal manner, and where those
   kitchenettes are continuously mechanically ventilated, at least when closed,
   shall not be deemed to subdivide the room.

   406.3. If any separation of a habitable room leaves a clear unobstructed
   opening between the parts of that habitable room at least equal to eighty
   percent (80%) of the cross sectional area of that part of the room receiving
   its light through any other part, that separation shall not be in violation of
   this section.
