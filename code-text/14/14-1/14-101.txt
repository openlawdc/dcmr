CIVIL ENFORCEMENT POLICY (§ 14-101)

101.1. The maintenance of leased or rental habitations in violation of the
   provisions of this subtitle, where those violations constitute a danger to the
   health, welfare, or safety of the occupants, is declared to be a public
   nuisance.

   101.2. The abatement of the public nuisances referred to in subsection 101.1
   by criminal prosecution or by compulsory repair, condemnation, and demolition
   alone has been and continues to be inadequate.

   101.3. The public nuisances referred to in subsection 101.1 additionally cause
   specific, immediate, irreparable and continuing harm to the occupants of these
   habitations.

   101.4. The public nuisances referred to in subsection 101.1 damage the quality
   of life and the mental development and well-being of the occupants, as well as
   their physical health and personal property, and this harm cannot be fully
   compensated for by an action for damages, rescission or equitable set-off for
   the reduction in rental value of the premises.

   101.5. It is the purpose of this section to declare expressly a public policy
   in favor of speedy abatement of the public nuisances referred to in subsection
   101.1, if necessary, by preliminary and permanent injunction issued by Courts
   of competent jurisdiction.
