                                  DC REGULATIONS

RIGHT OF ENTRY BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS (§ 14-104)

104.1. Any duly designated agent of the District of Columbia may enter the
   premises of a housing business at all reasonable hours, for the purpose of
   enforcing this section, except as limited by other provisions of this section.

   104.2. The District, both prior to the issuance of a housing business license
   and during the license period, may, at all reasonable hours, enter and inspect
   the premises occupied or to be occupied by a housing business, except as
   provided in subsection 104.3.

   104.3. If it appears that any portion of a premises is under the exclusive
   control of a tenant, or if the operator of a housing business so claims, the
   housing inspector shall not enter that portion of the premises without first
   having obtained permission from the tenant or the tenant&#8217;s agent, except
   as provided in § 104.4.

   104.4. If a tenant of a housing business does not give permission to inspect
   that portion of the premises under the tenant&#8217;s exclusive control, the
   housing inspector shall not enter that portion of the premises unless said
   inspector has:
   
   
   
   (a)	A valid administrative search warrant which permits the inspection
   pursuant to D.C. Official Code § 11-941 (2001) or D.C. Superior Court Civil
   Rule 204; or
   
   
   
   (b)	A reasonable basis to believe that exigent circumstances require immediate
   entry into that portion of the premises in order to prevent an imminent danger
   to the public health or welfare.

   104.5. When a duly designated agent of the District of Columbia presents a
   valid administrative search warrant that permits inspection of the premises
   under a tenant&#8217;s exclusive control, the tenant of a housing business who
   refuses to give permission to inspect that portion of the premises shall be in
   violation of this section.

   104.6. The refusal of any tenant to permit such an inspection shall not result
   in a revocation or suspension of the housing business, nor shall such refusal
   result in the assessment of penalties against the operator of a housing
   business license.
