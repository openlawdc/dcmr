                                  DC REGULATIONS

HOUSING ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS FOR ASSISTED HOUSEHOLDS (ยง 14-8302)

8302.1. Applicable Payment Standard. The Payment Standard, except in the case
   of enhanced vouchers, for each Household is the LOWER of:
   
   
   
   (a)	The payment standard for the household unit size and composition as set
   under Section 8300.2 above; OR
   
   
   
   (b)	The payment standard amount for the size of the dwelling unit rented by
   the household.

   8302.2. Amount of Monthly Housing Assistance Payment. DHCA shall pay a Monthly
   Housing Assistance Payment to the Owner on behalf of a participating Household
   that is equal to the payment standard for the Household as determined under
   8302.1 above, minus the Total Tenant Payment notwithstanding the amount of the
   gross rent and the household&#8217;s Family Share as determined under 8303
   below.

   8302.3. Decreases in Payment Standards During the HAP Contract. If the amount
   of the Payment Standard Schedule for the Unit Size decreases during the term
   of a HAP contract, DCHA shall determine the Total Tenant Payment and Monthly
   Housing Assistance Payment for the household as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	At the second annual reexamination of the Household following the
   effective date of the decrease in the Payment Standard Schedule amount, DCHA
   shall redetermine the Total Tenant Payment as provided under 8302.1 above,
   using the lower Payment Standard.
   
   
   
   (b)	DCHA shall determine whether the Monthly Housing Assistance Payment amount
   using the prior (higher) Payment Standard, or the monthly Housing assistance
   Payment amount using the decreased Payment Standard provides a lower or higher
   amount than the prior monthly Housing Assistance Amount (a higher amount being
   possible due to changes in household or unit size during the preceding
   examination period as required under 8302.5 below).
   
   
   
   (c)	If the Monthly Housing Assistance Amount is increased before the
   implementation of the decrease, then the provisions governing increases in
   Section 8302.4 below shall apply.

   8302.4. Increases in Payment Standards during the HAP Contract. If the amount
   on the Payment Standard Schedule for the Unit Size increases during the term
   of a HAP contract, then:
   
   
   
   (a)	The increased Payment Standard shall be used, as provided under 8302.1
   above, to calculate the Monthly Housing Assistance Payment; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The increase shall go in to effect as of the first annual reexamination on
   or after the effective date of the increase in the Payment Standard.

   8302.5. Changes in Family Size and Moves. Notwithstanding the provisions in
   8302.2 and 8302.3 above.
   
   
   
   (a)	The Payment Standard in effect at the time there is any increase or
   decrease in household size during the HAP contract term shall be used to
   determine the Total Tenant Payment and monthly Housing Assistance Payment for
   the household beginning at the first annual reexamination following the change
   in household size;
   
   
   
   (b)	If a family moves to a new unit, the Payment Standard in effect at the
   time of the move shall be used to determine the amount of the Total Tenant
   Payment and the monthly housing assistance payment; and the new lease shall be
   approved in accordance with 8301.1 above.
