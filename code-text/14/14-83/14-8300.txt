                                  DC REGULATIONS

PAYMENT STANDARD AMOUNT (§ 14-8300)

8300.1. Fair Market Rents. HUD publishes annually the fair market rents for
   each market area in the United States.
   
   
   
   (a)	DCHA uses the fair market rent published by HUD annually for the
   Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Statistical Area.
   
   
   
   (b)	The Fair Market Rent (FMR) is set by HUD for the District at the 50th
   percentile rent to provide a broad range of housing opportunities throughout
   the District in order to assist in achieving deconcentration objectives.
   
   
   
   (c)  	In the event HUD sets or reduces the fair market rents applicable to
   DCHA to less than fair markets rents at the 50 percentile rent as provided in
   8300.1 (b) above,  and such reduction in the fair market rents at the 50th
   percentile rents will either result in a decrease in the range of housing
   opportunities throughout the District and an increase in concentration of
   poverty among participants receiving rental assistance in the Housing Choice
   Voucher Program, or will hinder DCHA’s efforts to deconcentrate poverty
   among participants receiving rental assistance in the Housing Choice Voucher
   Program, DCHA may submit to the DCHA Board of Commissioners a written
   justification for maintaining a payment standard based on fair market rents at
   the 50th percentile rents as provided in 8300.1(b) above.
   
   
   
   (d)  	If DCHA submits a written justification for maintaining a payment
   standard based on fair market rents at the 50th percentile rents as identified
   in 8300.1 (c) above, DCHA shall submit a resolution for adoption by the DCHA
   Board of Commissioners, of a payment standard schedule based on fair market
   rents set at the 50th percentile fair market rents in accordance with Section
   8300.3 below.

   8300.2. Payment Standard.
   
   
   
   (a)	The Payment Standard is the percentage of the Fair Market Rents, as set by
   HUD, used to calculate the maximum housing assistance payments available at
   any given time.
   
   
   
   (b)	Under HUD’s rules, the Commission may set the Payment Standard for each
   size of unit at any level between 90 percent and 110 percent of the Fair
   Market Rent, or up to 120 percent as permitted under 8300.2(d) below.
   
   
   
   (c)	Within the basic range for Payment Standards as specified in 8300.2(b)
   above, a separate payment standard may be set for a designated part of the FMR
   area or for a particular size of units.
   
   
   
   (d)	Exception Payment Standards between 110 percent and 120 percent may be
   approved by the HUD Field Office for an exception area for all size units, or
   all units of particular sizes in an exception area.
   
   
   
   (e)	The Payment Standard is 110% of the Fair Market Rents for all size units
   in all areas of the District of Columbia. Any change to the Payment Standard
   shall be implemented by regulatory action of the Commission and shall apply to
   all vouchers issued after the date of the adoption of any regulation modifying
   the Payment Standard.

   8300.3. Payment Standard Schedule After publication by HUD of the Fair Market
   Rents, DCHA annually adopts, by resolution of the Board of Commissioners, the
   Payment Standard Schedule for the upcoming year for each unit size using the
   Payment Standard as identified in 8300.2(e) above.

   8300.4. HUD Discretion. Payment Standard Schedules are subject to review by
   HUD and HUD, at its discretion, may modify payment standard amounts for any
   unit size on the DCHA Payment Standard Schedule.
