                                  DC REGULATIONS

INTRODUCTION (ยง 14-9500)

The District of Columbia Housing Authority&#8217;s (DCHA) Local Rent Supplement
Program (LRSP) is authorized and funded with annual appropriations by the
District of Columbia government. The intent of the LRSP is to increase the stock
of permanent affordable housing units in the District of Columbia. It is
designed to complement the Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP) which is funded
by the federal government and administered by the DCHA. Similar to HCVP, the
LRSP is designed so that households contribute thirty percent (30%) of their
adjusted annual income toward the cost for housing. The LRSP will pay the
difference in the cost of housing. The LRSP has three types of housing
assistance: Tenant-based, Project-based, and Sponsor- based. For the most part,
and unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, the LRSP follows the rules and
regulations of the HCVP program as may be amended from time to time. Some of the
differences between LRSP and HCVP, as specified more fully herein, are that LRSP
is not for housing outside of the District of Columbia and the preferences and
priorities for the housing assistance are different than those specified in the
HCVP rules and regulations.
