                                  DC REGULATIONS

RENT CALCULATIONS (§ 14-6200)

6200.1. Notwithstanding provisions which may appear elsewhere in this
   subtitle, each tenant shall pay, as tenant rent, one of the following:
   
   
   
   (a) 	Income-based rent as the greater of one twelfth (1/12) of thirty percent
   (30%) of adjusted income or one twelfth (1/12) of ten percent (10%) of annual
   income.  The value of any assets or imputed income from assets will not be
   used in the calculation of income based rent.  Actual net income from assets
   greater than the threshold described above will be included in the
   determination of adjusted income;
   
   
   
   (b)	Market-based rent, if less than income-based rent, as determined by DCHA;
   
   
   
   (c)	If the family is determined by DCHA to have no adjusted income, the family
   will pay minimum rent as provided in §6210; or
   
   
   
   (d)	If the family is receiving welfare assistance from a public agency and a
   portion of the assistance is specifically designated to meet the
   family&#8217;s housing costs, then tenant rent is equal to the portion of the
   assistance which is so designated. However, the designated portion of the
   assistance must be adjusted in accordance with the family&#8217;s actual
   housing costs and be specifically designated for housing costs by the public
   agency.

   6200.2. Any changes in tenant rent shall be stated in a special supplement to
   the lease, which shall, upon issuance, become a part of the dwelling lease.
   The family shall be provided a copy of the special supplement to the lease.

   6200.3. The market-based rent is an estimate by DCHA of the market rent
   charged for comparable units in the private, unassisted market; and shall be
   determined by the market-based rent by considering factors including, but not
   limited to:
   
   
   
   (a)	the location, quality, size, unit type, and age of the unit, and
   
   
   
   (b)	any amenities, housing services, maintenance, and utilities provided by
   DCHA.

   6200.4. The market-based rent shall be equal to the estimated rent for which
   DCHA could lease the unit after preparation for occupancy. The market-based
   rent shall not be based on actual monthly costs to DCHA attributable to
   providing and operating the unit.

   6200.5. DCHA shall create a schedule of market-based rents for each property
   by bedroom type.

   6200.6. The schedule of market-based rents for all properties will be reviewed
   and revised at least every three (3) years.

   6200.7. DCHA may adjust the market-based rents for any particular property or
   unit if DCHA determines that the scheduled market-based rent is in excess of
   the amount necessary in order to lease a dwelling unit.

   6200.8. A copy of the market-based rent schedule for a property shall be
   available at each property management office or can be requested from the
   Client Placement Division, 1133 North Capitol Street, N.E. Suite 178,
   Washington, D.C. 20002-7599.

   6200.9. At initial lease-up and with each recertification or interim
   recertification, DCHA shall calculate the family&#8217;s income-based rent. If
   the market-based rent, as listed in the current market-based rent schedule for
   the property, is less than the family&#8217;s income-based rent, the family
   shall be changed to market-based rent.

   6200.10. If a tenant is paying a market-based rent, the tenant shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	submit an interim recertification in accordance with § 6117 for any
   change in family circumstances except increases in family income. Change in
   family circumstances may include, but shall not be limited to, loss or
   reduction. in income, employment, or other assistance; or increase in expenses
   for medical costs, child care, transportation, or education.
   
   
   
   (b)	provide DCHA with a completed application for continued occupancy, in
   accordance with § 6116 once every three (3) years or upon request by DCHA.

   6200.11. All changes in tenant rent, both income-based and market-based and
   whether after an interim or regular recertification, shall be implemented in
   accordance with § 6116.10.

   6200.12. In properties where utilities and other essential services are
   supplied to the tenant by DCHA, tenant rent payable to DCHA under the dwelling
   lease shall be the same as total tenant payment.

   6200.13. In properties where tenants are responsible for paying for their own
   utility bills, the utility allowance shall be subtracted from the total tenant
   payment to determine that tenant rent payable to DCHA. If the tenant rent
   resulting from the subtraction of the utility allowance from the total payment
   is negative, DCHA shall send a monthly check in the amount of the difference
   to the tenant.

   6200.14. Tenant shall be given a thirty (30) day written notice of an increase
   in contract rent.

   6200.15. Tenant rent shall be computed after both annual income and adjusted
   income have been verified.

   6200.16. Any changes in tenant rent shall be stated in a special supplement to
   the lease, which shall upon issuance, become a part of the dwelling lease. The
   tenant shall be provided a copy of the special supplement.

   6200.17. The tenant shall receive retroactive credit to credit an
   administrative error.

   6200.18. Tenants occupying property for a portion of a month at the time of
   move-in shall be charged a pro-rata share of the full monthly rate determined
   by DCHA.
