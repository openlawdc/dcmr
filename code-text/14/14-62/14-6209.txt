ABATEMENT OF RENT (§ 14-6209)

6209.1. In the event that a unit is rendered uninhabitable under the
   provisions of §6501.2, DCHA shall abate the tenant&#8217;s total tenant
   payment in proportion to the seriousness of the damage and loss in value as a
   dwelling, in the event that repairs are not made as provided for in § 6501.2.

   6209.2. No abatement of rent shall occur if the tenant fails to cooperate with
   workmen seeking to make the repairs, rejects alternative accommodations, or if
   the damage was caused by the tenant, the tenant’s household, or guests.

   6209.3. Evidence that a unit was uninhabitable under § 6501.2, and that
   abatement is required, may include a vacate order by a District Housing
   Inspector, or other substantial documentation.
