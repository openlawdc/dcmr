6202.1. Tenants who do not pay for their own electricity shall be charged
   reasonable amounts for electricity consumed as a result of major electrical
   appliances which are not provided by DCHA. Major electrical appliances include
   the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Clothes dryer(s);
   
   
   
   (b)	Food freezer(s);

   (d)	Air conditioner(s);
   
   
   
   (e)	Washing machine(s); and
   
   
   
   (f)	Dish washers.

   6202.2. Excess utility charges for air conditioners shall only be applied
   during the months of May, June, July, August and September.

   6202.3. Excess utility charges and any revisions to these charges, shall be
   established by DCHA on the basis of the provisions of § 6201 of this chapter,
   including consumption calculations.

   6202.4. It is the responsibility of the tenant to obtain the approval of DCHA
   prior to the installation of any electrical appliance listed in § 6202. 1.
   Excess utility charges shall be incurred at the start of the month following
   installation. DCHA shall prepare and execute a special supplement to the lease
   to reflect excess utility charges.

   6202.5. Excess utility charges required under §§ 6202.1 and 6202.7 shall not
   become due and collectible until the first (1st) day of the second month
   following the month in which the charge is incurred.

   6202.6. Upon receipt of a report from a tenant indicating an appliance is
   inoperable in his or her unit, DCHA shall assess the applicable charge until
   such time as the appliance in question is removed from the dwelling unit.

   6202.7. Tenants who do not pay for their own utilities, but who occupy a unit
   with a checkmeter system for individual units, shall be charged reasonable
   amounts for utility consumption in excess of the appropriate utility allowance
   established by DCHA for that unit.

   6202.8. Where DCHA converts a specific property to a checkmeter system, there
   shall be a transition period of at least six (6) months during which no excess
   utility charges shall be charged against the tenant. During this transition
   period, DCHA shall do the following:
   
   
   
   (a)	Advise the tenant of the amounts which would be charged, based on
   checkmeter readings;
   
   
   
   (b)	Advise tenants with high utility consumption rates on methods for reducing
   their usage; and
   
   
   
   (c)	Give specific thirty (30) day notice to the tenant of the effective date
   after which utility charges shall be assessed.  DCHA shall prepare and execute
   a special supplement to the lease to implement excess utility charges related
   to checkmeter systems.
