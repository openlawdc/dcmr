   requirements of this section, and consistent with the definitions of these
   households in § 2599 of this chapter.

   2510.2. The Department shall use the methods described under § 2510.3 and §
   2510.5 to determine income limits.

   2510.3. The Department shall take the median income for the Washington, D.C.
   Metropolitan Statistical Area established periodically by the Secretary of the
   U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and calculate the
   income limits as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	Fifty percent (50%) of the median income for very low income households;
   
   
   
   (b)	Eighty percent (80%) of the median income for lower income households; and
   
   
   
   (c)	One hundred ten percent (110%) of the median income for moderate income
   households.

   2510.4. The amounts calculated shall be applied to a four (4) person household
   size in each income category, and using these amounts as a base number, the
   following percentage adjustments shall be calculated to adjust the income
   limits by family size:

   2510.5. The base amounts and the amounts determined by the percentage
   adjustments shall be rounded to the nearest fifty dollars ($50).

   2510.6. The amounts calculated by the Department in accordance with § 2510.2
   through § 2510.5 shall be published as a notice.

   2510.7. The income limits established shall be periodically reviewed and

   households in the Washington area. This review and revision shall be generally
   done on an annual basis; provided, that the current median income established
   by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for
   the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Statistical Area is available.
