2505.1. Except as provided for in §§ 2505 through 2506, all financial
   assistance under the Program shall be Principal-Only Loans repayable, after
   five (5) years, consistent with § 2504.2 of this Chapter, secured by a lien

   the applicant is a Displaced Household, and would be required to move from the
   home he or she now occupies if monthly payments of principal were required
   beginning in the sixth year of the loan, but meets all other requirements of
   this chapter, the applicant may receive an additional deferral of all payments
   beyond the initial five-year deferred period, subject to review and approval
   by the Department for a period not to exceed five (5) years after the date of
   such additional deferment.
