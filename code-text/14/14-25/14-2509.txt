   after settlement of the loan, except as provided in ยง 2506.

   2509.2. The prepayment penalty shall be equal to the interest on the principal

   2509.3. The rates shall be disclosed to the recipient at the time of
   settlement.

   2509.4. The prepayment penalty may be waived by DHCD upon a showing that the

   Loan, the principal amount of the HPAP loan, a reasonable brokerage fee and
   whatever paid-in equity the recipient has in the property.
