                                  DC REGULATIONS

AVAILABLE SUBSIDY LEVELS (ยง 14-9303)

9303.1. Owners of existing units, and units to be substantially rehabilitated
   or newly constructed, are eligible to apply for Partnership Program subsidy
   for up to one hundred percent (100%) of the units in each property
   participating in the Partnership Program, or such lesser percentage as may be
   set by the DCHA Board of Commissioners for a particular development, housing
   assistance program or allocation of vouchers under 9302.3 above.

   9303.2. Partnership Program subsidy may be provided for up to one hundred
   percent (100%) of the units in a qualified property if the property is a
   single-family house or units that are specifically for households comprised of
   elderly families, disabled families, families receiving supportive services,
   to the extent permitted under federal funding restrictions, or as otherwise
   permitted by action of the DCHA Board of Commissioners. The maximum percentage
   available can be determined by contacting DCHA&#8217;s Housing Choice Voucher
   Program.

   9303.3. The initial and subsequent rents paid under the Housing Assistance
   Payment Contract (Contract Rents) will be based upon an analysis of the
   reasonableness of the proposed rent in the neighborhood in which the property
   is located.
   
   
   
   Contract Rents will not exceed the payment standard for the areas in which the
   property is located. In some neighborhoods this is as much as 120% of the Fair
   Market Rents (FMRs) adjusted for bedroom size.

   9303.5. For Fiscal Year 2002, 2003, and 2004, FMRs will be based on the 50th
   percentile of rents in the Metropolitan Statistical Area. The current FMRs are
   available by contacting the Housing Choice Voucher Program.

   9303.6. DCHA may, after review by the Board of Commissioners, enter into a
   Housing Assistance Payment contract where the percentage of the total units to
   be subsidized exceeds 50% of the units, provided that the total operating
   subsidy is reasonable and necessary and not in excess of the funds necessary
   for the financial viability and proper operation of the property. Each unit
   and household occupying a voucher assisted unit is subject to Section 9312.7
   as well as all other program requirements.
