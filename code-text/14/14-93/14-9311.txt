                                  DC REGULATIONS

HOUSING ASSISTANCE PAYMENT CONTRACT (ยง 14-9311)

9311.1. For existing units, DCHA will enter into an Agreement to Enter into a
   Housing Assistance Payment (AHAP) Contract for a term of not more than six (6)
   months.

   9311.2. For new construction and substantial rehabilitation, DCHA will enter
   into an AHAP Contract for a term of not more than three (3) years.

   9311.3. If the units have not been occupied by the end of the AHAP Contract
   term, the allocation will be rescinded. If, after rescission, the Owner is
   still interested in the Partnership Program and additional allocations are
   available, the Owner will be required to submit a revised application under a
   new announcement.

   9311.4. Once the Partnership Program units are occupied, DCHA will enter into
   a HAP Contract with the Owner based on the FMRs in place at the time the HAP
   Contract is executed. Upon commencement of the contract term, DCHA will make
   monthly Housing Assistance Payments in accordance with the HAP Contract for
   each unit occupied by an eligible family. The initial term of the HAP Contract
   is up to ten (10) years, subject to future availability of appropriations, and
   the HAP Contract may be extended for an indefinite period thereafter. To
   obtain the current FMRs, see Section 9303.5 of this Title.

   9311.5. Owners agree to accept eligible tenants from DCHA&#8217;s waiting list
   in accordance with their own rental screening criteria and to maintain the
   units at acceptable Housing Quality Standards for the term of the HAP
   Contract.

   9311.6. As long as the vacancy is not the fault of the Owner and the Owner is
   taking every reasonable action to minimize likelihood and extent of any
   vacancy, DCHA will make vacancy payments for up to sixty (60) days for vacant
   units designated for Partnership Program subsidy.

   9311.7. If a unit remains vacant for one hundred and twenty (120) days from
   the first day of the month in which the unit became vacant, DCHA may reduce
   the HAP Contract with the Owner in an amount equivalent to the remaining
   months of subsidy attributable to the vacant unit.
