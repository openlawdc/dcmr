                                  DC REGULATIONS

BILLING (§ 14-5504)

5504.1. The Receiving PHA shall provide initial billing to DCHA:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   No later than ten (10) business days following the date of execution of the
   HAP contract; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   To receive the billing no later than sixty (60) days following the expiration
   date of the Family’s voucher issued by the Initial PHA.

   5504.2. DCHA shall accept billing by mail, fax, or email.   If billing notice
   is not received by the deadline DCHA shall contact the Receiving PHA by mail,
   email, or fax to determine the status of the Family.

   5504.3. If the Receiving PHA reports that the Family is not yet under HAP
   contract, DCHA shall inform the Receiving PHA in writing that they shall not
   accept any subsequent billing on behalf of the Family and shall not honor any
   subsequent billing, and the Receiving PHA shall be required to absorb the
   voucher.

   5504.4. If the Receiving PHA reports that the Family is under HAP contract and
   it cannot absorb the Family DCHA shall accept the subsequent late billing.

   5504.5. The Receiving PHA shall send a copy of the updated HUD Form-50058 at
   each regular recertification for the duration of time the Receiving PHA is
   billing DCHA on behalf of the Family, regardless of whether there is a change
   in the billing amount.

   5504.6. Should DCHA fail to receive an updated HUD Form-50058 by the annual
   recertification date, it shall contact the Receiving PHA to verify the status
   of the Family.  DCHA may not withhold payment solely because the Receiving PHA
   did not submit the updated HUD Form-50058 by the annual recertification date.

   5504.7. DCHA shall also receive a new HUD Form-52665 along with the HUD
   Form-50058 when the Initial PHA reports any changes in the billing amount, if
   applicable. The notice shall be received by DCHA no later than ten (10)
   working days following the effective date of the change.

   5504.8. If the Receiving PHA fails to send the HUD Form-52665 within ten (10)
   working days following the effective date of the change in the billing amount,
   DCHA is not responsible for paying any increase in the monthly billing amount
   incurred prior to the notification.

   5504.9. Should there be a decrease in the monthly billing amount DCHA shall
   notify the Receiving PHA in writing of the overpayment and DCHA shall recover
   overpayment in the following month’s payment. If DCHA is unable to recover
   payments in the following month, DCHA shall demand that the Receiving PHA
   reimburse within thirty (30) days of notification.
