                                  DC REGULATIONS

DENYING PORTABILITY MOVES DUE TO INSUFFICIENT FUNDING (§ 14-5502)

5502.1. If DCHA denies a request for portability due to insufficient funding
   such requests shall be documented with proper financial documentation
   demonstrating DCHA’s inability to support the portability request.

   5502.2. DCHA shall only deny a request to move to a higher cost area if DCHA
   would be unable to avoid terminations of housing choice voucher assistance for
   current participants during the calendar year in order to remain within its
   budgetary allocation (including any available HAP reserves) for housing
   assistance payments.

   5502.3. Before denying the Family’s request to move due to insufficient
   funding, DCHA shall contact the Receiving PHA to determine whether the
   Receiving PHA will absorb the Family.

   5502.4. If the Receiving PHA is willing to absorb the Family, there shall be
   no grounds to deny the portability move for insufficient funding.

   5502.5. If DCHA denies a Family’s request for a portability move due to
   insufficient funding, it shall not admit any additional families to its
   voucher program until it determines that sufficient funding exists to approve
   the move and has notified the Family that the Family may now exercise its move
   to the higher cost area.

   5502.6. DCHA shall consider a Family’s request for a portability move for
   thirty (30) days from the date the request was filed if there is insufficient
   funding to immediately grant the request.

   5502.7. If funds become available within thirty (30) days which would allow
   the Family to move to a higher cost area, DCHA shall notify the Family by
   first class mail that funds are available, and that the request is granted.

   5502.8. If funding is unavailable after thirty (30) days, DCHA shall notify
   the Family by first class mail that the request to port is denied, and that
   they may reapply to port after ninety (90) days from the date of denial.
