BILLING DEADLINES AND ONGOING RESPONSIBILITIES (§ 14-5510)

5510.1. DCHA shall submit initial billing notice as follows:
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   No later than ten (10) working days following the date the HAP contract was
   executed; and
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   In time that it shall be received no later than sixty (60) days following the
   expiration date of the Family’s voucher issued by the Initial PHA.
   
   
   
   5510.2 	When billing, DCHA shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	Send HUD Form-52665 and HUD Form-50058 via fax, mail or email, as
   acceptable by the initial PHA;
   
   
   
   (b) 	DCHA shall inform the Initial PHA of its MTW status and its 	Biennial
   Recertification initiative;
   
   
   
   (c)	Send the Initial PHA a copy of the updated HUD Form-50058 at each biennial
   recertification for the duration of time DCHA is billing the Initial PHA on
   behalf of the Family, regardless of whether there is a change in the billing
   amount; and
   
   
   
   (d) 	Send a new HUD Form-52665 along with the HUD Form-50058 to report any
   changes in the billing amount, if applicable. The notice shall be sent to the
   Initial PHA no later than ten (10) working days following the effective date
   of the change.
   
   
   
   5510.3 	Should the biennial recertification be late and DCHA fail to submit
   the billing within ten (10) days of the effective date the initial PHA may not
   withhold payment solely because DCHA did not submit the updated from HUD
   Form-50058 by the biennial recertification date.
   
   
   
   5510.4 	If DCHA causes the delay, the Initial PHA is not required to pay any
   increase in payment after the billing deadline, and may begin paying the
   increased amount the following month.
   
   
   
   5510.5 	Should DCHA fail to properly notify the Initial PHA and the Initial
   PHA refuses to pay the increased cost, DCHA shall be required to absorb the
   increased cost for the period in which the billing was late.
   
   
   
   5510.6 	When a current Family in good standing requests to port outside of
   DCHA jurisdiction, DCHA shall:
   
   
   
   (a)	Not issue a voucher to the Family; and
   
   
   
   (b)	Notify the Initial PHA of the Family’s desire to port to another
   jurisdiction.

   5510.7. The Initial PHA shall be responsible for issuing a voucher and sending
   the portability paperwork to the PHA where the Family wishes to port.  DCHA
   shall assist the Initial PHA by providing them the most current HUD Form-50058
   and supporting documentation.

   5510.8. Billing arrangements shall be terminated once the HAP payments for the
   landlord terminate. DCHA shall notify the Initial PHA in advance of the
   effective date of the termination of billing.
