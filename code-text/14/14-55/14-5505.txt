                                  DC REGULATIONS

INCOMING PORTABILITY PROCEDURES (§ 14-5505)

5505.1. Once DCHA receives the portability packet, the assigned Housing
   Programs Specialist shall ensure that the Family’s voucher has not expired
   and will not expire within thirty (30) days.

   5505.2. If an incoming Family’s voucher has expired, the specialist shall
   contact the Initial PHA to see if any extensions are granted.  If the Initial
   PHA grants an extension, the PHA must provide a corrected voucher and HUD
   Form-52665 before DCHA will schedule an appointment for the Family.

   5505.3. If the voucher is expired or the term of the voucher will not allow
   sufficient time to process, and the Initial PHA has already been contacted,
   the portability packet shall be returned to the Initial PHA with a cover
   letter stating the reasons for returning the packet.

   5505.4. When DCHA is billing the Initial PHA, the assigned Housing Programs
   Specialist shall ensure that the Family has at least thirty (30) days left on
   the voucher before scheduling an appointment. If the time left on the voucher
   is less than thirty (30) days, the specialist shall contact the Initial PHA
   and request the maximum time allowed on the voucher, in order to ensure that
   the voucher term shall leave sufficient time to process a Request for Lease
   Approval, HQS, and execution of HAP contract, and cover the anticipated
   delivery time so that it shall be received by the Initial PHA by the deadline
   date on the HUD Form-52665.

   5505.5. DCHA shall schedule the portability appointment within two (2) weeks
   of receiving the portability packet.  The notice of appointment date and time
   will be sent by first-class mail. The letter shall also tell the Family what
   documents are needed for the portability appointment.
   
   
   
   5505.6 	DCHA shall not re-determine eligibility for a portable Family that was
   already receiving voucher assistance.

   5505.7. DCHA shall issue the voucher at the time of portability appointment
   and shall not delay the voucher issuance or approval of unit due to new income
   recertification unless the Family refuses to comply with DCHA procedures.
   
   
   
   5505.8 	After issuing a portable voucher, DCHA may take subsequent action
   against the Family based on the results of a background check or adjusted
   income determination.
