ANNUAL LEAVE (§ 14-7119)

7119.1. Annual leave is scheduled paid leave earned by an employee for absence
   from duty without loss of pay for a vacation or time allowed for personal or
   emergency purposes. Annual leave will be accrued at the following rates:
   
   
   
   (a)	Less than 3 years of service ½ day (4 hours) per pay period or 13 days
   per year;
   
   
   
   (b)	3 to15 years of service ¾ day (6 hours) per pay period or 20 days per
   year; and
   
   
   
   (c)	15 or more years of service 1 day (8 hours) per pay period or 26 days per
   year.

   7119.2. Annual leave may be saved. For most employees, a maximum of two
   hundred forty (240) hours may be carried over from year-to-year. In certain
   circumstances, annual leave that has been lost because of administrative error
   or public business may be restored. Such restored leave shall be credited to a
   separate leave account to be used within two (2) years.

   7119.3. At termination of employment with the Authority, an employee will be
   paid a lump sum for any unused annual leave. In the event of death, unused
   annual leave is paid to survivor(s). Payment follows the same order of
   precedence or is made in accordance with specific designation.
