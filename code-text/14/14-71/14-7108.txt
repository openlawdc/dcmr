                                  DC REGULATIONS

HIRING, INFLUENCES IN HIRING, SUPERVISION, ASSIGNMENT OF CLOSE RELATIVES OF
EMPLOYEES (ยง 14-7108)

7108.1. Except in special circumstances, usually related to unique skills and
   qualifications, the hiring or influencing in hiring of close relatives of
   Authority employees is discouraged. A close relative is defined as a person
   related by blood, marriage, or adoption as well as employees involved in
   relationships characterized by the permanence, duration and stability normally
   associated with family relationships or marriage.

   7108.2. Should individuals become related to one another while employed at the
   Authority, they will not be promoted or transferred into a position under the
   supervision of the relative. If individuals become related to one another
   while employed at the Authority and they are in a supervisor/subordinate
   relationship, the Authority may transfer either individual.

   7108.3. When special circumstances are authorized, individuals may not be
   assigned to work in a department or proximate work location to which a close
   relative is assigned.

   7108.4. Applicants will be required to disclose a relationship with a current
   Authority employee if it is one of those listed above.

   7108.5. Exceptions from this policy must be approved by the Executive
   Director.
