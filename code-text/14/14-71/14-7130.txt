                                  DC REGULATIONS

FLEXI-PLACE (ยง 14-7130)

7130.1. The Authority may offer alternative workplace arrangements.
   Flexi-place is a management option rather than an employee benefit and does
   not change the terms and conditions of appointment. Employee participation is
   voluntary and subject to management approval. An employee who works
   flexi-place (other than for short periods) must sign an agreement with the
   Authority. Canceling flexi-place arrangement is effected by either the
   employee or the supervisor, with notice, and in accordance with Authority
   procedures.
