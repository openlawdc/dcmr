                                  DC REGULATIONS

PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS OR APPRAISALS (§ 14-7113)

7113.1. The evaluation of an employee’s performance is intended to assist
   the employee to become a more effective worker through standards of
   performance established by the supervisor. In no event is an employee’s
   employment performance record a substitute for disciplinary action under the
   personnel policy and procedures. However, the performance evaluation must be
   used to establish attempted non-disciplinary corrective action in support of
   subsequent disciplinary action for unsatisfactory work performance. The
   Performance Appraisal (PA) is intended to cover over-all performance during a
   specific period of time. The PA shall be made a permanent part of the
   employee’s file.

   7113.2. The PA shall also contain performance standards which identify the
   duties of each position, the position’s priorities, resources and expected
   accomplishments.

   7113.3. The PA shall contain a written evaluation of the performance of the
   employee designed to inform the employee of the manner in which the expected
   accomplishments are to be met.
