                                  DC REGULATIONS

PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE (§ 14-7138)

7138.1. Progressive disciplinary action against an employee is short of
   removal and must provide notice to the employee and the possible consequences
   of such discipline. The Disciplinary Action Notice must delineate the problem,
   the employee’s required action to correct the behavior, and the consequences
   if corrective action is not taken. Written warnings and corrective actions
   must be discussed with the employee. Supervisors must give employees one (1)
   corrective action warning for violations of policy, departmental rules or
   regulations, HUD rules and regulations, or acts of misconduct, as a means of
   progressive discipline, prior to issuing a Disciplinary Action Notice.
   However, under appropriate circumstances, immediate dismissal may be
   warranted.

   7138.2. The following offenses shall be cause for progressive discipline
   whenever practicable:

   (c)	Sexual harassment which has the effect of unreasonably interfering with an

   (d)	Habitual tardiness;
