                                  DC REGULATIONS

SICK LEAVE (§ 14-7120)

7120.1. Sick leave is paid leave granted to employees to be used when an
   employee is incapacitated by sickness or injury, or disability, as certified
   by a physician’s certificate, for disabilities caused, or contributed to, by
   pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, childbirth and recovery therefrom, for
   medical, dental or optical examination or treatment, for necessary care and
   attendance during illness of children, spouse, or the employee’s immediate
   family. The family is defined as persons related by blood, marriage, or
   adoption, as well as employees involved in relationships characterized by the
   permanence, duration and stability normally associated with family
   relationships or marriage. Use of sick leave for any other purpose should be
   considered abuse of this policy and may subject the employee to disciplinary
   action.

   7120.2. The earning rate for full time employees is four (4) hours for each
   full bi- weekly pay period. Sick leave that is not used during the leave year
   in which it accrues shall accumulate and be available for use in succeeding
   years. There is no limitation on the amount of sick leave an employee can
   accumulate.

   7120.3. A physician’s statement may be required for a sick leave absence for
   an unreasonable period of time, i.e., in excess of three (3) work days.

   7120.4. An employee must complete ninety (90) days of employment to become
   eligible for paid sick leave upon separation from the Authority.
