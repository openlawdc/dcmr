                                  DC REGULATIONS

DISCIPLINARY PERFORMANCE PROBATION (§ 14-7115)

7115.1. A permanent employee, who is not serving a promotion probationary
   period, may be placed on probation as a disciplinary measure or as a result of
   a less than a “fully successful” Performance Appraisal. The supervisor
   must state, in writing, the steps the employee must take to improve his or her
   conduct or performance. If it is determined that an employee is to be placed
   on disciplinary performance probation for a period of evaluation, the period
   of probation shall not exceed three (3) months. Receipt of a less than
   “fully successful” performance appraisal at the completion of the
   three-month (3) period may result in removal under the provisions outlined in
   § 7111.

   7115.2. A disciplinary performance probation action is not subject to the
   progressive discipline provisions of § 7138 of this chapter. During this
   probationary period, the employee shall not be selected for another position
   that may become vacant, nor is he or she eligible to use annual leave, except
   for an extreme emergency approved by the Department Director.

   7115.3. The following are illustrations of less than “fully successful”
   conduct:
   
   
   
   (a)	Failure to observe departmental rules, regulations, directives, policies
   or procedures of the Authority or HUD rules and regulations.
   
   
   
   (b)	Failure to comply with standards of efficient service or competence;
   
   
   
   (c)	Failure to comply with the instructions of an authorized supervisor;
   
   
   
   (d)	Carelessness in performance of duties and responsibilities.
