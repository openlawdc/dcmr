STEP INCREASES (§ 14-7117)

7117.1. No employee shall receive a step increase whose performance is rated
   less than fully successful. The performance of such employees shall be
   re-evaluated for up to three (3) months, in conjunction with the Disciplinary
   Performance Probationary period, until a “fully successful” or better
   rating is achieved or the employment is terminated. Once an employee achieves
   a fully successful or better rating, a step increase will be granted and the
   anniversary date for future step increases changed to the date of the delayed
   increase.
