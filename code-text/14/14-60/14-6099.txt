DEFINITIONS (ยง 14-6099)

(a) 	Annual Income includes, but is not limited to, the following:



(1) 	The full amount, before any payroll deduction, of wages and salaries,
overtime pay, commissions, fees, tips, and bonuses, and other compensation for
personal services;



(2) 	The net income from operation of a business or profession.  Expenditures
for business expansion or amortization of capital indebtedness shall not be used
as deductions in determining net income.  An allowance for depreciation of
assets used in a business or profession may be deducted, based on straight line
depreciation, as provided in Internal Revenue Service regulations.  Any
withdrawal of cash or assets from the operation of a business or profession will
be included in income, except to the extent the withdrawal is reimbursement of
cash or assets invested in the operation by the family;



(3) 	Interest, dividends, and other net income of any kind from real or personal
property greater than $1,000 per year.  Expenditures for amortization of capital
indebtedness shall be used as deduction in determining net income. All allowance
for depreciation is permitted only as authorized in paragraph (a)(2) of this
definition. Net income from assets will be included in Annual Income for the
purposes of this title if net income from assets exceeds $1,000. 
Notwithstanding this threshold, all assets with a value greater than $15,000
must be reported annually.  Regardless of the value of the assets, imputed
income from assets will not be included in Annual Income.
