                                  DC REGULATIONS

PREFERENCES FOR PUBLIC HOUSING (ยง 14-6105)

6105.1. At the time of application, applicants self-certify their preference.
   Verification of a preference is not required until an applicant reaches the
   top of the waiting list. Applicants will be required to provide verification
   that they meet the preference as part of the eligibility determination
   process.

   6105.2. The granting of a preference does not guarantee admission to public
   housing. Preferences are used merely to establish the order of placement on
   the waiting list. Every applicant for public housing or the Housing Choice
   Voucher Program must also meet DCHA&#8217;s Applicant Selection Criteria
   outlined in Section 6109 below.
   
   
   
   (a)	Preferences
   
   
   
   (1)	Mixed Population Properties
   
   
   
   (i)	the following admission preference system will be applied in the selection
   of otherwise eligible applicants from the waiting list (based on the time and
   date of application) for a public housing unit offered in mixed population
   properties:
   
   
   
   	Preference #1: Elderly Families and/or Disabled Families
   
   
   
   	Preference #2: Near Elderly Families
   
   
   
   	Preference #3: All Other Families
   
   
   
   (ii)	no individual shall be considered a person with disabilities, for
   purposes of eligibility for public housing under this Title, solely on the
   basis of any current drug or alcohol dependence.
   
   
   
   (2)	General Population Properties &#8211; the following applicant admission
   categories, including percentages, will be applied to the selection of
   otherwise eligible applicants from the public housing waiting list (based on
   the time and date of application) for public housing units offered in general
   population properties:
   
   
   
   	Category #1: Working Families (50% Annually)
   
   
   
   	Category #2: All Other Families (40% Annually)
   
   
   
   (3)	Emergency Category &#8211; Up to 10% (not to exceed 100 units) annually of
   all applicants housed in the general and/or mixed-population properties will
   be selected from qualified applicants in the emergency category. Emergency
   category is defined in 14 DCMR Section 6099.1.
   
   
   
   (b)	If there are no applicants on the waiting list that qualify for the
   emergency category, otherwise eligible applicants will be selected for
   admission.
   
   
   
   (c)	The admission systems described above will work in combination with
   requirements to match the characteristics of applicant families to the type of
   units available, including units for targeted populations, e.g., elderly,
   disabled. The ability to provide public housing for qualified applicants will
   depend on the availability of appropriately sized public housing units.

   6105.3. The DCHA shall select families from the waiting list in the Emergency
   Category by date and time of application, except when a situation is a
   federally or locally declared natural disaster or civil disturbance, in which
   case the Executive Director has the discretion to waive date and time of
   application in selection. Any determination by the Executive Director to waive
   the date and time of application must be in writing stating the maximum number
   of applications that will be selected under these provisions or any limits on
   time for the waiver, with such waiver being approved for form and legal
   sufficiency by General Counsel and published in the D.C. Register.

   6105.4. The preferences for admission to the Housing Choice Voucher Program
   are found in the DCHA&#8217;s Administrative Plan for the Section 8
   Certificate and Housing Voucher Programs.
