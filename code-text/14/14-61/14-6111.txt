6111.1 	When an applicant reaches the top of the waiting list, DCHA shall
   review the applicant’s file to determine whether the information is current
   and correct. Information shall be considered current if it was verified by
   DCHA within no more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to tenant

   submit information in accordance with Section 6106 of this Chapter.

   6111.3. Eligible applicants shall be offered an appropriate unit, when
   available, consistent with the priorities and requirements of this Title.

   6111.4. Each applicant shall be assigned an appropriate unit, on a
   community-wide basis, in sequence based upon the date and time of application,
   suitable type or size or unit, preference, consistent with the objectives of
   Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and applicable HUD regulations and
   requirements.

   6111.5. Suitable vacancies arising at a given time at any location shall be
   offered to the selected applicant first in sequence at the time of vacancy;
   provided, that referrals may be made out of sequence in the following
   situations:
   
   
   
   (a)	For applicants with a preference or in the emergency category, assignments

   before the applicant may be offered a second location.

   6111.8. If the applicant is willing to accept the unit offered but is unable
   to move at the time of the offer, and presents clear evidence to DCHA’s

   count as one of the number of allowable refusals permitted the applicant
   before removing the applicant from the waiting list.

   6111.9. If the applicant presents evidence to the satisfaction of DCHA that
   acceptance of a given offer of a suitable vacancy may result in undue hardship
   not related to considerations of race, sex, color, or national origin, such as
   inaccessibility to employment, children&#8217;s day care, refusal of such an
   offer shall not be counted as one of the number of allowable refusals
   permitted an applicant before removing the applicant from the waiting list.

   unit, the refusal shall not be counted as one of the allowable refusals.
