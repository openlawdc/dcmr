LIVE-IN AIDES (ยง 14-6121)

6121.1. It is the policy of DCHA to grant reasonable accommodations, such as a
   live-in aide, subject to compliance with the provisions set forth in Chapter
   74 of this Title.

   6121.2. Live-in aide means a person who resides with one or more elderly
   persons, or near-elderly persons, or persons with disabilities, and who:
   
   
   
   (a)	Is determined to be essential to the care and well-being of the person(s);
   
   
   
   (b)	Is not otherwise legally or financially obligated for the support of the
   person(s); and
   
   
   
   (c)	Would not be living in the unit except to provide the necessary supportive
   services.

   6121.3. A live-in aide is subject to approval of DCHA prior to occupancy. At
   any time, DCHA may refuse to approve a particular person as a live-in aide.
   DCHA may withdraw such approval for reasonable cause. A live-in aide resides
   in a unit identified on a lease, but is not a lessee with rights of tenancy,
   and does not possess the right to participate in the resident council.

   6121.4. A live-in aide must abide by all the rules and regulations of DCHA as
   well as those of the particular property where they reside. DCHA will provide
   a thirty (30) day written warning notice to a resident of a determination to
   withdraw approval of a live-in aide prior to issuing any notice required to
   commence a legal action to terminate the lessee&#8217;s tenancy This decision
   by DCHA is subject to the Grievance Process available to Lessees.

   6121.5. The income of an approved live-in aide shall not be included in the
   calculation of rent, and the name of an approved live-in aide shall not be
   added as a Lessee to the Dwelling Lease, but shall be added as a live-in aide
   prior to taking up occupancy of a unit, otherwise such person is deemed to be
   an unauthorized occupant. While an application is pending for a live-in aide
   the live-in-aide may occupy the unit to provide the necessary supportive
   services as a guest of the Lessee in accordance with Subsection 6500.1(h).

   6121.6. Definitions of &#8220;elderly,&#8221; &#8220;near-elderly,&#8221; and
   &#8220;persons with a disability&#8221; are as required by federal regulations
   in 24 CFR ยง 5.403 as may be amended.
