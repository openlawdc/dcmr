                                  DC REGULATIONS

TENANT SELECTION AND ASSIGNMENT[COLON] FAMILIES WITH DISABILITIES (§ 14-6112)

6112.1 In the selection of a family to occupy a UFAS-Accessible Unit, as such
   units become available in the appropriate bedroom size in DCHA-owned
   properties, DCHA shall offer the UFAS-Accessible Unit to a family that is
   qualified for the available bedroom size of the Unit and has a verified need
   for the features of a UFAS-Accessible Unit in the following order of priority,
   with date and time of application or transfer request where there are multiple
   applicants within any one priority:
   
   
   
   (a)	First, to any current resident requesting, and eligible for, a transfer to
   a UFAS-Accessible Unit;
   
   
   
   (b)	Second, to an applicant household eligible for a UFAS-Accessible Unit in,
   which applicant is designated for interim assistance under the terms of
   DCHA’s Amended Voluntary Compliance Agreement with the U.S. Department of
   Housing and Urban Development, dated May 1, 2006, hereinafter referred to as
   the Amended VCA.
   
   
   
   (c)	Third, to the next applicant household eligible for a UFAS-Accessible
   Unit;
   
   
   
   6112.2 In the selection of a family to occupy a Reasonable Accommodation Unit,
   as such units become available in the appropriate bedroom size in DCHA-owned
   properties, DCHA shall offer the Reasonable Accommodation Unit as follows,
   based on the earliest date and time of application:
   
   
   
   (a)	First, to the next applicant household of the appropriate size, whose
   application indicates a household member is mobility impaired and uses a
   walker, crutches or cane and is qualified for a Reasonable Accommodation Unit;
   
   
   
   (b)	Second, if there is not an eligible, qualified applicant under 6112.2(a)
   above who wishes to reside in the available Reasonable Accommodation Unit,
   then it will be offered to an applicant household of the appropriate size,
   whose application indicates a household member is mobility impaired and uses a
   walker, crutches or cane, but who does not need the accessible features of the
   unit.

   6112.3. If a UFAS-Accessible Unit or a Reasonable Accommodation Unit are
   vacant for a period of more than thirty (30) days, and there are no families
   with mobility disabilities requesting the reasonable accommodation on the
   transfer or waiting lists, then DCHA may offer the unit to an applicant who
   does not need the accessibility features of the unit.

   6112.4. Households electing to occupy either a UFAS-Accessible Unit or a
   Reasonable Accommodation Unit that do not require the accessibility features
   of the unit, will be required to execute a Special Supplement to the Lease
   that legally obligates the household to relocate to a vacant unit of an
   appropriately sized without accessibility features within ten (10) days of
   written notice from DCHA that there is an eligible applicant or existing
   resident with disabilities who requires the accessibility features of the
   unit.
