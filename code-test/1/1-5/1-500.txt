   cross-appeals then pending but not heard.

   500.2. No case which is pending but not heard after the effective date of
   these rules shall be disposed of on the sole ground that either party failed

   corrected.

   500.3. Except for the time limits for filing a notice of appeal and a notice
   of cross-appeal (§§ 503.2 and 503.4), the Board for good cause shown may, in

   adopted by a District department, agency, or office, this chapter shall
   govern. In the event of a conflict within this chapter between a general and a
