INVOLUNTARY DISMISSALS AND DEFAULTS (§ 1-2818)

2818.1. Except as provided in Subsection 2818.2, if the party initiating a

   or otherwise fails to prosecute the case, the Administrative Law Judge may, on
   his or her own motion or on the motion of the opposing party, dismiss all or
   part of the case.  Dismissal will ordinarily be with prejudice unless the

   unless the Administrative Law Judge decides otherwise.

   2818.3. If an attorney, representative, or unrepresented party fails, without
   good cause, to appear at a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge may dismiss
   the case, enter an order of default, decide the case on the merits, or impose
   other sanctions.

   2818.4. If an attorney, representative, or unrepresented party fails, without
   good cause, to appear at a pretrial, settlement, or status conference, the
   Administrative Law Judge may determine the appropriate sanction, which may
   include dismissal or entry of default.
