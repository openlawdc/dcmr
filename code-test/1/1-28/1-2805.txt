                                  DC REGULATIONS

DEFAULTS IN CIVIL FINE CASES (§ 1-2805)

2805.1. This Section contains rules for deciding civil fine cases in which the
   Respondent does not file an answer.  There are separate procedures for Civil
   Infractions Act cases, Litter Control Administration Act cases, and other
   cases, because the law establishes different requirements for each of those
   cases.

   2805.2. In a Civil Infractions Act case filed on or before September 30, 2010,
   if a Respondent fails to answer a Notice of Infraction within the time allowed
   by law, the Government must issue a second Notice of Infraction, as required
   by the Civil Infractions Act.  OAH also may issue a notice of default.  The
   notice of default shall inform the Respondent of any penalty provided by law,
   and shall direct the Government to issue a second Notice of Infraction.
   
   
   
   2805.3  	In a Civil Infractions Act case filed on or before September 30,
   2010, if the Government fails to file a second Notice of Infraction within
   thirty (30) calendar days after a notice of default is served, an
   Administrative Law Judge may dismiss the charge against the Respondent.

   2805.4. In a Civil Infractions Act case filed on or before September 30, 2010,
   if a Respondent fails to answer a second Notice of Infraction within the time
   allowed by law, an Administrative Law Judge shall determine whether:
   
   
   
   		(a)	The Government has submitted evidence of proper service; and
   
   
   
   		(b)	Each Notice of Infraction meets all legal requirements on its face.
   
   
   
   If so, the Administrative Law Judge shall find the Respondent in default and
   shall impose the legally authorized fine and penalty.  If not, the
   Administrative Law Judge shall dismiss both Notices of Infraction without
   prejudice.
   
   
   
   2805.5 	In a Civil Infractions Act case filed on or after October 1, 2010, and
   in a Litter Control Administration Act case, if a Respondent fails to answer
   within the time allowed by law, an Administrative Law Judge shall determine
   whether:
   
   
   
   		(a)	The Government has submitted evidence of proper service; and
   
   
   
   (b)	The Notice of Infraction or Notice of Violation meets all legal
   requirements on its face.
   
   
   
   If so, the Administrative Law Judge shall find the Respondent in default and
   shall impose the legally authorized fine and penalty.  If not, the
   Administrative Law Judge shall dismiss the Notice of Infraction or Notice of
   Violation without prejudice.

   2805.6. In a Civil Infractions Act case filed on or after October 1, 2010, if
   the USPS returns an order finding the Respondent in default to the Clerk’s
   Office, for reasons that call into question the accuracy of any affidavit
   filed under Subsection 2803.5 (for example, “no such address,”
   “addressee unknown”), an Administrative Law Judge shall issue an order
   requiring the Government to show why the default order should not be vacated. 
   If the Government does not respond with sufficient evidence showing that it
   mailed the Notice of Infraction to a valid address for the Respondent, the
   default order shall be vacated and the Notice of Infraction shall be
   dismissed.
   
   
   
   2805.7  	In default cases not brought under the Civil Infractions Act or the
   Litter Control Administration Act, the procedure shall be consistent with the
   applicable law and shall ensure that:
   
   
   
   		(a)	There is sufficient evidence of proper service on the Respondent;
   
   
   
   (b)	The charging document meets all legal requirements on its face; and
   
   
   
   (c)	A Respondent who fails to answer shall be held in default and must pay the
   legally authorized fine and penalty.
