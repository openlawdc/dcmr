                                  DC REGULATIONS

BEGINNING A CASE BY REQUESTING A HEARING (§ 1-2808)

2808.1. Unless a statute or these Rules describe a different way to begin a
   case, a party seeking a hearing at OAH must file a request for hearing in
   writing.

   2808.2. The request for hearing need not follow any specific format, although
   blank forms are available from the Clerk’s office.  A request for hearing
   should contain the following information:
   
   
   
   		(a)	A short description of your dispute;
   
   
   
   		(b)	A description of what you want the judge to do;
   
   
   
   		(c)	Any key dates that are involved;
   
   
   
   		(d)	A copy of any ruling or decision that you are disputing or appealing;
   
   
   
   		(e)	Your full name, address, and telephone and fax numbers; and
   
   
   
   (f)	If known, the full name, address, and telephone and fax numbers of every
   other party involved in the dispute.

   2808.3. Parties must pay close attention to any deadlines for filing hearing
   requests.  The deadlines are set by statute, regulations, or agency rules
   other than these Rules, and not by OAH.

   2808.4. A party requesting a hearing in a Child Support Services Division
   (CSSD) enforcement action must file a copy of the Order of Condemnation or
   other proof that CSSD has issued an Order of Condemnation.

   2808.5. Any hearing request to appeal a proposed tax assessment, other than a
   proposed real property tax assessment, must be filed with OAH and sent to the
   District of Columbia Office of Tax and Revenue.  The hearing request should
   state the type of tax (for example, personal, business, or franchise), tax
   year(s), and amount of tax appealed.  The hearing request should include a
   copy of the proposed tax assessment.

   2808.6. Any hearing request to appeal a decision concerning a Certificate of
   Need must be filed with OAH and sent to the Director of the State Health
   Planning and Development Agency (SHPDA) in the Department of Health.  SHPDA
   must transfer the agency record of the proceedings to OAH within thirty (30)
   calendar days of service of the request for hearing.
