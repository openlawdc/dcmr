                                  DC REGULATIONS

ABATEMENT COST REQUESTS (§ 1-2807)

2807.1. Before or after an Administrative Law Judge has issued a final order
   finding a Respondent liable for a violation of the Litter Control
   Administration Act, the Government may file a motion to require the Respondent
   to pay abatement costs.  The Government must file the motion, with an
   itemization, not later than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after
   service of a final order.

   2807.2. A Respondent may request a hearing on the Government’s motion.  The
   request must be in writing and must be filed within thirty (30) calendar days
   after the Government serves its motion.

   2807.3. If a Respondent timely requests a hearing on the Government’s
   motion, the presiding Administrative Law Judge shall hold a hearing on the
   issue of abatement costs, which may be consolidated with any hearing on the
   violation.  If an Administrative Law Judge has held a separate hearing on the
   violation and found the Respondent liable for the violation, or if the
   Respondent has admitted liability, or if an Administrative Law Judge has found
   the Respondent in default, the Respondent may not have another hearing on
   liability for the violation.

   2807.4. If a Respondent does not file a timely request for a hearing on the
   Government’s motion, the Administrative Law Judge may:
   
   
   
   (a)	Decide, based on the papers filed, whether the Government is entitled to
   recover abatement costs and their amount; or
   
   
   
   (b)	Before deciding the issue, order the Government and the Respondent to
   appear 	for a hearing on the issue.
