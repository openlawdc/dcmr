                                  DC REGULATIONS

BEGINNING A CIVIL FINE CASE (§ 1-2803)

2803.1. Sections 2803 through 2807 establish procedures for cases in which the
   Government seeks payment of a civil fine.

   2803.2. When the Government is seeking a civil fine, it must file a Notice of
   Infraction or a Notice of Violation, as authorized by law, at OAH.  The
   Government may not file a Notice of Infraction, under the Civil Infractions
   Act, without complying with Subsection 2803.5, and may not file a Notice of
   Violation, under the Litter Control Administration Act, without complying with
   Subsection 2803.8.

   2803.3. The Government must provide a copy of the Notice of Infraction or
   Notice of Violation to the Respondent (the person or entity that the
   Government wants to pay the fine) in the manner specified in the Civil
   Infractions Act, the Litter Control Administration Act, or other applicable
   law.

   2803.4. If a Respondent files an answer before the Government files a Notice
   of Infraction or a Notice of Violation, OAH will open a case.  The
   Administrative Law Judge may require the Government to file the original
   Notice of Infraction or Notice of Violation.

   2803.5. In a Civil Infractions Act case filed on or after October 1, 2010, if
   the Government sends a Notice of Infraction to the Respondent by first-class
   mail, the Government may not file the Notice of Infraction until at least
   fifteen (15) calendar days after the date that it mailed the Notice of
   Infraction.  When it files the Notice of Infraction, the Government also must
   file an affidavit, on a form approved by the Chief Administrative Law Judge,
   verifying that the United States Postal Service (USPS) did not return the
   Notice of Infraction to the Government.

   2803.6. If the USPS returns a Notice of Infraction to the Government after it
   has filed the affidavit required by Subsection 2803.5, the Government must
   notify OAH by filing a new affidavit, on a form approved by the Chief
   Administrative Law Judge.

   2803.7. If the USPS returns the Notice of Infraction to the Government, the
   Government may file proof of any alternative service of the Notice of
   Infraction.

   2803.8. In a Litter Control Administration Act case, if the Government sends a
   Notice of Violation to a Respondent by certified mail, the Government must
   file a copy of a signed certified mail receipt or other proof that the USPS
   delivered the Notice of Violation to the Respondent’s address.  If the USPS
   returns the certified mail to the Government, the Government may file proof of
   any alternative service of the Notice of Violation.

   2803.9. When it files a Notice of Infraction or a Notice of Violation, the
   Government must file a copy of all exhibits it expects to offer at any hearing
   in the case and must provide a copy of each exhibit to the Respondent.  An
   Administrative Law Judge may allow the Government to use exhibits that it did
   not file or provide in accordance with this Subsection if there is no
   prejudice to the Respondent.

   2803.10. OAH may dismiss or may refuse to accept for filing any Notice of
   Infraction or Notice of Violation that does not comply with the applicable law
   or these Rules.

   2803.11. In civil fine cases, the Government may transfer data by electronic
   means as authorized by Subsection 2841.14.
