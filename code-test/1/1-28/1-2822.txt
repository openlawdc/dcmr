                                  DC REGULATIONS

BURDEN OF PROOF (§ 1-2822)

2822.1 	Unless otherwise established by law, the proponent of an order shall
   have the burden of proof, that is, the requirement to persuade the
   Administrative Law Judge on every contested factual issue.
   
   
   
   2822.2 	Unless otherwise established by law, the burden of production, that
   is, the requirement to introduce evidence first, shall be as follows:
   
   
   
   (a) 	Whenever a party challenges the Government’s denial of an application
   for a license, permit, or public benefit, the Government shall have the burden
   of producing sufficient evidence to establish the reasons for the denial;
   
   
   
   (b) 	Whenever the Government suspends, revokes, or terminates a license,
   permit, or public benefit, or proposes to do so, the Government shall have the
   burden of producing sufficient evidence to establish the reasons for its
   action;
   
   
   
   (c) 	The party asserting an affirmative defense identified in District of
   Columbia Superior Court Civil Rule 8(c) shall have the burden of producing
   sufficient evidence to establish that defense; and
   
   
   
   (d) 	The party asserting an exception to the requirements or prohibitions of
   any statute or rule shall have the burden of producing sufficient evidence to
   establish that exception.
   
   
   
   2822.3 	Otherwise, an Administrative Law Judge shall allocate the burden of
   producing evidence to promote fairness, equity, substantial justice, and sound
   judicial administration.
   
   
   
   2822.4  	If the party with the burden of production fails to appear, the party
   with the burden of proof still must meet its burden, unless otherwise provided
   by law.

   2822.5. If a party has presented all of its evidence on an issue on which it
   has the burden of proof, and the presiding Administrative Law Judge concludes
   that the party has failed to meet its burden, the Administrative Law Judge may
   find against that party on that issue without awaiting the close of all the
   evidence in that case.
