                                  DC REGULATIONS

FILING OF PAPERS (§ 1-2809)

2809.1. A “paper” means any pleading, motion, exhibit or witness list, or
   any other written submission filed with OAH.

   2809.2. Any paper filed at OAH must be legible and signed by a party or a
   party’s representative.

   2809.3. To file any paper at OAH, a person must bring, mail, fax, or have the
   paper delivered to the Clerk’s office during regular business hours from
   9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on a business day.  A paper is filed on the day the
   Clerk’s office receives it during business hours, except as provided in
   Subsection 2809.5 below.

   2809.4. REPEALED

   2809.5. The filing date of a fax transmission will be determined as follows:
   
   
   
   (a)	The filing date is the date on which the fax is received in the Clerk’s
   office between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.  If a paper is received on
   a date or at a time when the Clerk’s office is not open, the paper shall be
   deemed to have been filed when the Clerk’s office is next open.
   
   
   
   (b)	A party filing a paper by fax is responsible for delay, disruption,
   interruption of electronic signals, and legibility of the paper, and accepts
   the risk that the paper may not be filed.
   
   
   
   (c)	Any incomplete or illegible fax will not be considered received unless a
   hard copy of the fax is filed or a complete and legible fax is received within
   three (3) calendar days of the first transmission.  In a response to a motion,
   the Administrative Law Judge may extend this time.

   2809.6. A party also may file any paper by e-mail, as authorized by Section
   2841.
