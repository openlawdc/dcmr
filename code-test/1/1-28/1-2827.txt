TRANSCRIPTS; CITATION AND COSTS (§ 1-2827)

2827.1. All proceedings, except for mediations, shall be recorded.  The
   recording is the official record of what occurred at the proceeding.

   2827.2. Any party may obtain a copy of the recording of a hearing at the
   party’s expense.

   2827.3. Transcripts of the recording of the proceedings shall be prepared by a
   qualified reporter or transcriber who shall personally certify that he or she
   is not a party or counsel to a party or otherwise related to or employed by a
   party or counsel in the case; that he or she has no material interest in the
   outcome of the case; and that the transcript represents the testimony and
   proceedings of the case as recorded.

   2827.4. In filings, a party may only rely upon a transcript prepared according
   to this Section.

   2827.5. Unless otherwise stipulated by the parties or ordered by an
   Administrative Law Judge, if a party cites to a portion of a transcript, the
   entire transcript of the case must be filed at OAH, and a copy must be served
   on all parties.

   2827.6. In any case in which a party files a petition for review in the
   District of Columbia Court of Appeals, OAH will arrange for the preparation
   and filing of a transcript without charge only if the Court of Appeals has
   permitted the Petitioner to proceed in forma pauperis.  In all other cases,
   OAH will arrange for preparation and filing of a transcript only after OAH
   receives payment for the cost of preparing the transcript.
