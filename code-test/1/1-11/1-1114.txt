PROCEDURES FORREPORTS TO THE BOARD (ยง 1-1114)

1114.1. The standard process for the Board learning of a violation is through
   the receipt of a report of a violation from the CFO on a form that the Board
   shall prescribe. However, the Board may also receive a report from the IG in
   instances where there is a conflict of interest for the CFO. The CFO (or IG)
   shall conduct a preliminary investigation and provide the Board, at a minimum,
   with the following information:
   
   
   
   (a)	The appropriation or fund account, the amount involved for each violation,
   and the date on which the violation occurred;
   
   
   
   (b)	The name(s), position(s), and agency(ies) of the employee(s) involved with
   the violation;
   
   
   
   (c)	All facts pertaining to the violation, including the type of violation
   (for example, over-obligation of an appropriation), the primary reason or
   cause, valid justification, and any germane report by the agency&#8217;s
   fiscal official and/or the agency&#8217;s counsel;
   
   
   
   (d)	A statement from the responsible employee(s) that fully addresses the
   employee&#8217;s actions in the matter so that the Board has the benefit of
   the employee&#8217;s description of what transpired, the basis for the
   employee&#8217;s action, mitigating factors, justification, and other relevant
   factors when it considers culpability and recommends appropriate
   administrative action. If an employee declines to provide a written statement,
   the agency head (or Deputy Mayor, if the agency head is the alleged violator)
   shall provide a written statement to that effect;
   
   
   
   (i)	In the case where an employee is suspected of willfully and knowingly
   violating the Act, a statement as to whether, and when, this matter has been
   reported to the IG and/or the United States Attorney for the District of
   Columbia;
   
   
   
   (j)	A statement regarding the adequacy of the system of administrative
   controls;
   
   
   
   (k)	A statement of any additional action taken by, or at the direction of, the
   agency head (or Deputy Mayor, as appropriate), including any new safeguards
   provided to prevent recurrence of the same type of violation; and
   
   
   
   (l)	If another agency is involved, a statement concerning the steps taken to
   coordinate the report with the other agency.

   1114.2. In extraordinary circumstances, the Board may vote to accept a report
   from an alternative source.
