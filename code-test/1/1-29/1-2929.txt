RENTAL HOUSING CASES &#8211; CONSOLIDATION OF PETITIONS AND EXPANDING THE SCOPE
OF A PROCEEDING (ยง 1-2929)

2929.1 	An Administrative Law Judge may consolidate (join) two (2) or more
   petitions if they present identical or similar issues, involve the same rental
   unit or housing accommodation, or involve other circumstances in which
   consolidation would be expedient and would not prejudice the parties.  A party
   may file a motion to consolidate or an Administrative Law Judge may
   consolidate cases on his or her own motion.
   
   
   
   2929.2 	If the Administrative Law Judge determines that the issues raised in a
   tenant petition may affect other tenants or all tenants in the housing
   accommodation, the Administrative Law Judge may expand the scope of the
   proceeding to include all affected tenants.

   2929.3. Before expanding the scope of the proceeding, the Administrative Law
   Judge shall provide notice to the affected tenants and the housing provider.

   2929.4. That notice shall state the issues to be decided and shall advise the
   tenants that they have a right to participate in the proceedings and that any
   decision shall be binding on them.

   2929.5. Tenants and the housing provider may present any arguments in support
   of or opposition to expanding the scope of the proceeding.
