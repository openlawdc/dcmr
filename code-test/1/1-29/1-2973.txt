                                  DC REGULATIONS

PUBLIC BENEFITS CASES &#8211; ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEWS (§ 1-2973)

2973.1 	An administrative review is an informal meeting between the person who
has requested a hearing at OAH and a representative of the agency or service
provider whose action or inaction is being challenged by that person.  The
purpose of an administrative review is to determine whether the agency’s or
service provider’s position is valid and, if possible, to achieve an informal
solution.



2973.2 	An agency or service provider shall offer each person who requests a
hearing at OAH an opportunity for an administrative review, if required by law. 
At least five (5) calendar days before the hearing date, the agency or service
provider shall file and send to all parties and their representatives a status
report, which says whether an administrative review was held, and the results of
any review.



2973.3 	In cases involving shelter or other services for homeless persons, as
required by the Homeless Services Reform Act of 2005, D.C. Official Code §§
4-1601.01, et seq., the Department of Human Services shall conduct the
administrative review.



2973.4 	As required by law, the agency or service provider shall make the case
file available to the person who requested the hearing.
