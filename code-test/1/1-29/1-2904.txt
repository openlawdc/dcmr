DCPS STUDENT DISCIPLINE CASES &#8211; RECONSIDERATION (§ 1-2904)

2904.1. No party in a student discipline case shall have the right provided by
   Section 2828 to file a motion for reconsideration or for a new hearing or a
   motion for relief from a final order.

   2904.2. If the adult student or minor student’s parent or guardian did not
   receive actual notice of the hearing and DCPS has issued a final notice of
   disciplinary action, the adult student or minor student’s parent or guardian
   may file a request for reconsideration with DCPS and request that DCPS vacate
   the final notice and refer the case back to OAH for a hearing and to vacate
   the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.  When it decides such a request,
   DCPS may order a new hearing or DCPS may ask for OAH to decide whether to
   grant a new hearing.
