  <heading>NOTICE OF VIOLATION OR NOTICE OF INFRACTION, AND ORDER TO ELIMINATE LEAD-BASEDAINT HAZARDS (§ 20-3318)</heading>
  <level>
    <num>3318.1.</num>
    <text>DDOE may take steps to determine the existence of a lead-based paint hazard whenever DDOE has reason to believe that there is a risk that a lead-based paint hazard is present in a dwelling unit, an accessible common area of a multifamily property,
      or a child-occupied facility such as a day care center or kindergarten program that is regularly attended by children under the age of six (6) years constructed prior to 1978.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>3318.2.</num>
    <text>To determine whether a lead-based paint hazard is present, DDOE’s investigation of a dwelling unit, accessible common area, or a child-occupied facility pursuant to § 3318.1 shall be followed by a report to the owner and the tenant, and may include:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>A visual inspection; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Any other form of lead hazard evaluation.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>3318.3.</num>
    <text>If a lead-based paint hazard is identified, DDOE may issue a written Notice of Violation or Notice of Infraction, and an Order to Eliminate Lead-Based Paint Hazards (collectively “Notice and Order”), to the property owner or to any other person. A
      Notice and Order shall:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>Identify the violation;</text>
