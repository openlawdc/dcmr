      <text>The requestor is confronted with a situation involving the Act or this title which requires, or may require, him or her to take action; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>The legality or propriety of the action to be taken is not clear from the plain text of the Act or this title.</text>

    <text>Any request for an advisory opinion shall set forth sufficient information to allow the Board to understand the issues involved and to frame a response. The requestor shall also state which section of the Act or section of this title the requestor

    <num>1902.3.</num>
    <text>If the writer presents insufficient facts in any request for an advisory opinion, the Board may, in its discretion, issue a letter of information; engage in fact-finding through investigation or in a noncontested case hearing; request the writer to
      provide by letter more facts or details in support of his or her request; or decline to issue an advisory opinion.</text>

  </level>
  <level>
    <num>1902.5.</num>
    <text>If issued, an advisory opinion is not binding upon the requestor but shall constitute guidance to the requestor as to how the Board may interpret the Act or this title on a particular matter, the facts of which are consistent with those raised by
      the requestor. Where the requestor is also a licensee, the Board may issue a show cause notice pursuant to ยง 1604 of this title in the instance where the facts raised by the requestor provide the Board with reasonable cause to believe that the requestor&amp;#8217;s

      the reasons and legal argument which support the requestor&amp;#8217;s points of disagreement, or may request the Board to issue a declaratory order, pursuant to ยง 1903. Advisory opinions of the Board may not form the basis of an appeal to any court
