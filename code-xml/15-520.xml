  <heading>REPORTS REQUIRED IN SECOND AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS (§ 15-520)</heading>
  <level>
    <num>520.1.</num>
    <text>The company shall provide a written report by February 15th of each year that examines and explains in detail the reasons for operating performance results outside the ranges forecast in the company&amp;#8217;s prior year report concerning its annual
      projections of monthly fuel prices, consumption and expenditures, generating system operating performance and maintenance budget, and timetable.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>520.2.</num>
    <text>In addition to this report, after the first six (6) months of data becomes available and again upon the filing of the annual PIP on February 15th, the company shall submit another report to the Commission identifying and discussing in detail the factors
      responsible for its progress or lack of progress toward meeting the prior year&amp;#8217;s productivity improvement objectives.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>520.3.</num>
    <text>In the second year and in each year thereafter, the staff shall prepare a report for the Commission summarizing the company&amp;#8217;s operating performance over the first six (6) months under the FAC, and shall again as part of its annual PIP report
      do the following:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>Provide an analysis of the company&amp;#8217;s progress in meeting its productivity improvement goals; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Evaluate PEPCO&amp;#8217;s operating performance under the FAC over the previous twelve (12) months.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>520.4.</num>
    <text>The staff may recommend that the particular operating performance should be investigated further by the Commission. (This recommendation would not necessarily presume that imprudent management decisions were the cause of the abnormal performance,
      but would suggest to the Commission that the company should thoroughly reveal the reasons for its performance to the Commission&amp;#8217;s satisfaction).</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>520.5.</num>
    <text>If the Commission finds that further investigation is unnecessary, the staff’s request shall be denied. However, if the Commission is not satisfied with the company&amp;#8217;s explanation of its performance a further investigation (which may include
      an evidentiary hearing) shall be undertaken.</text>
