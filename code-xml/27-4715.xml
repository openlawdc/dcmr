  <heading>BASIC ORDERING AGREEMENTS (§ 27-4715)</heading>
  <level>
    <num>4715.1.</num>
    <text>Under basic ordering agreements (also known as task order contracts or term contracts), the contractor’s performance obligations are triggered when the Department subsequently issues task orders pursuant to the contract.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4715.2.</num>
    <text>Basic ordering agreements include:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>Requirements contracts; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Indefinite quantities contracts.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4715.3.</num>
    <text>A requirement contract provides the mechanism for the Department to order from the contractor all of its requirements for designated supplies or services during a specified period subject to any maximum ordering limitation in the contract. This type
      of contract should only be used when the Department determines that a requirement contract will provide superior economic benefits to an indefinite quantity contract as it locks the Department into one (1) source of supply for the goods or services
      required under the basic ordering agreement. The CCO and the Contracting Officer must approve requirement contracts.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4715.4.</num>
    <text>An indefinite quantity contract provides for an indefinite quantity, within specified limits, of supplies or services to be furnished during a fixed period.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4715.5.</num>
    <text>An indefinite quantity contract:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>Requires the Department to order and the contractor to deliver at least the stated minimum quantity of supplies or services; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Requires the contractor to deliver any additional quantities the Department may order during the contract period subject to any maximum quantity limitations in the contract.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4715.6.</num>
    <text>The Department may award a single indefinite quantity contract for particular goods or services, or may award multiple contracts and choose between the selected contractors in awarding subsequent delivery orders.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4715.7.</num>
    <text>If an indefinite quantity contract is used, the Department shall establish, at the time the basic ordering agreements are awarded, a procedure by which work will be awarded under the basic ordering agreements (award procedure).</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4715.8.</num>
    <text>Generally, one (1) of the following three (3) award procedures shall be used for indefinite quantity contracts:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The rotating award procedure, where work is assigned on a rotation basis (that is, the first task order is given to Contractor A, the second task order to Contractor B, and so on);</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>The competitive award procedure, where the Department requests task order proposals from two (2) or more contractors holding an indefinite delivery contract; or</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>Attempt to otherwise divide the work (for example, by geographic area or facility) equitably among the contractors.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4715.9.</num>
    <text>The competitive award procedure is preferred.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4715.10.</num>
    <text>If the competitive award procedure is used, each task order request shall specify:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The specific goods or services required;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>A delivery date; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>Such other information as the Department may reasonably request.</text>
