    <text>The gallon retained by the BMP or land cover shall:</text>
    <text>Be in excess of the Stormwater Retention Volume (SWRv) for a major regulated project or, for a site that is not regulated, in excess of pre-project retention;</text>
    <text>Be no more than the SRC ceiling; and</text>
    <text>Not be installed to comply with a stormwater management requirement of a statute, regulation, or court order, including for:</text>

      <text>Reduction of Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) in compliance with the court-approved consent decree, including court-approved modifications, for reducing CSOs in the District of Columbia, except that retention capacity installed on an experimental
        basis as a requirement of the consent decree shall be eligible if a subsequent modification of the consent decree ends the requirement to maintain that retention capacity; or</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(B)</num>
      <text>Compliance with a Watershed Implementation Plan established under a Total Maximum Daily Load for the Chesapeake Bay.</text>

    <text>Other documentation that the Department requires to determine that the eligibility requirements are satisfied, including documentation that a maintenance provider has the expertise and capacity to provide required maintenance for the time period of
      SRC certification; and</text>
    <text>A signed promise from the owner of the property on which the BMP or land cover is located to notify the Department if, during the period of time for which a SRC is certified, the property is sold or otherwise transferred to another person.</text>

    <text>At the Director’s discretion and to allow for the aggregation of SRCs, the Department may approve a SWMP that proposes aggregation of retention from small sites under a common design and that:</text>
