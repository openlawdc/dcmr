    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(d)</num>
      <text>The proposed small generator facility, in aggregation with other generation on the distribution circuit, may not contribute more than ten (10) percent to the distribution circuit&amp;#8217;s maximum fault current at the point on the primary line

        there are known or posted transient stability limitations to generating units located in the general electrical vicinity.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(l)</num>
      <text>Except as permitted by an additional review in Level 2 Procedures, Section 4005.7, no construction of facilities by an EDC on its own system shall be required to accommodate the small generator facility.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4005.3.</num>
    <text>Interconnection to area networks is not permitted under the Level 2 review process.</text>

  <level>
    <num>4005.4.</num>
    <text>The Level 2 interconnection review shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>An EDC shall, within ten (10) business days after receipt of the interconnection request, inform the interconnection customer in writing or by electronic mail that the interconnection request is complete or incomplete. As part of this process, the
        EDC shall assign a queue position. The queue position of the interconnection request shall be used to determine the potential adverse system impact of the small generator facility based on the relevant screening criteria. If there are higher queued
        interconnection customers on the same radial line circuit or spot network, the EDC shall evaluate the interconnection request by performing any Level 2 screens requiring aggregate capacity calculations and determine if the small generator facility
        exceeds any of the aggregate capacity requirements. If an aggregate capacity requirement is exceeded, the EDC shall not be obligated to meet the timeline for reviewing the interconnection request until such time as the EDC has completed the review
        of all other interconnection requests that have a higher queue position and impact the aggregate capacity calculation that has been exceeded and shall so notify the interconnection customer.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>When an EDC determines that additional information is required to complete an evaluation, the EDC shall request the information. The time necessary to complete the evaluation may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, but only to the extent
        of the time required for receipt of the additional information. During an extension of time to submit additional information, the EDC may not begin a new review process or alter the interconnection customer&amp;#8217;s queue position.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>Within twenty (20) business days after the EDC notifies the interconnection customer that it has received a completed interconnection request, the EDC shall:</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(1)</num>
      <text>Evaluate the interconnection request using the Level 2 screening criteria;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(2)</num>
      <text>Review the interconnection customer&amp;#8217;s analysis, if provided by the interconnection customer, using the same criteria used by the customer;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(3)</num>
      <text>Conduct a spot network impact study at its own expense within the above noted timeframe, if deemed necessary by the EDC; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(4)</num>
      <text>Provide the interconnection customer with the EDC&amp;#8217;s evaluation, including a comparison of the results of its own analyses with those of interconnection customer, if applicable. When an EDC does not have a record of receipt of the interconnection
        request and the interconnection customer can demonstrate that the original interconnection request was delivered, the EDC shall expedite its review to complete the evaluation of the interconnection request within twenty (20) business days of the
        interconnection customer&amp;#8217;s re-submittal.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4005.5.</num>
    <text>When an EDC determines that the interconnection request passes the Level 2 screening criteria, the EDC shall provide the interconnection customer a small generator interconnection agreement within five (5) business days after the determination.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4005.6.</num>
    <text>When an EDC determines that the interconnection request fails one (1) or more of the Level 2 screening criteria but determines that the small generator facility can be interconnected safely and reliably, the EDC shall provide the interconnection customer
      a small generator interconnection agreement within five (5) business days after the determination.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4005.7.</num>
    <text>Additional review may be appropriate when a small generator facility has failed to meet one or more of the Level 2 screens. An EDC shall offer to perform additional review to determine whether minor modifications to the electric distribution system
      would enable the interconnection to be made consistent with safety, reliability and power quality criteria. The EDC shall provide the interconnection customer with a nonbinding, good faith estimate of the costs of additional review and minor modifications.
      The EDC shall undertake the additional review or modifications only after the interconnection customer consents to pay for the review and modifications.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4005.8.</num>
    <text>An interconnection customer shall have thirty (30) business days to sign and return the agreement. When an interconnection customer does not sign the agreement within thirty (30) business days, the interconnection request shall be deemed withdrawn
      unless the interconnection customer requests to have the deadline extended in writing prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) business day period. The request for extension may not be unreasonably denied by the EDC.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4005.9.</num>
    <text>When construction is required under the provisions of Sections 4005.5 and 4005.6, the interconnection of the small generator facility shall proceed according to all milestones agreed to by the parties in the small generator interconnection agreement.
      The small generator interconnection agreement shall not become final until:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The milestones agreed to in the small generator interconnection agreement are satisfied;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>The small generator facility is approved by electric code officials with jurisdiction over the interconnection;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>The interconnection customer provides a certificate of completion to the EDC. Completion of local inspections may be designated on inspection forms used by local inspecting authorities; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(d)</num>
      <text>There is a successful completion of the witness test per the terms and conditions found in the Standard Agreement for Interconnection of Small Generator Facilities, unless waived.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4005.10.</num>
    <text>If the small generator facility is not approved under a Level 2 review, the EDC shall provide the interconnection customer a letter explaining its reasons for denying the interconnection request. The interconnection customer may submit a new interconnection
      request for consideration under a Level 3 or Level 4 interconnection review. The queue position assigned to the Level 2 interconnection request shall be retained provided the request is made within fifteen (15) business days of notification that
      the current interconnection request is denied.</text>
