  <level>
    <num>6212.1.</num>
    <text>The Neighbor to Neighbor Initiative is intended to assist public housing residents in improving their economic and social well-being and to give residents a greater stake in their communities. The Neighbor to Neighbor Initiative allows residents the
      opportunity to give back to their communities and facilitates upward mobility. Through the performance of voluntary work or duties that provide a community benefit to their neighbors, residents are able, on an individual basis, to improve the quality
      of their lives, enhance their level of self-sufficiency, and increase self-responsibility in their communities.</text>
