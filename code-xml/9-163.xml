  <heading>COMBINED REPORTING[COLON] DETERMINATION OF TAXABLE INCOME OR LOSS USING COMBINEDEPORT (§ 9-163)</heading>
  <level>
    <num>163.1.</num>
    <text>The use of a combined report does not disregard the separate identities of the taxpayer members of the combined group. Each taxpayer member is responsible for tax based on its taxable income or loss apportioned or allocated to the District, which
      shall include, in addition to other types of income, the taxpayer member’s apportioned share of business income of the combined group, where business income of the combined group is calculated as a summation of the individual net business incomes
      of all members of the combined group. A member’s net business income is determined by removing all except business income, expense and loss from that member’s total income, as provided in D.C. Official Code §§ 47-1810.04 and 47-1810.05.</text>
