    <text>The Executive Director may approve a procurement on an emergency basis which does not otherwise comply with the requirements of this title if the procurement is essential to an Agency requirement to deal with an existing emergency condition, as defined

    <text>For purposes of an emergency procurement under this chapter, an &amp;#8220;emergency condition&amp;#8221; is a situation (such as a flood, epidemic, riot, equipment failure, or other reason set forth in a proclamation issued by the Mayor or a written
      determination by the Executive Director) which creates an immediate threat to the public health, welfare, or safety. The existence of an emergency condition creates an immediate need for supplies or services which cannot be met through normal procurement
      methods, and the lack of which would seriously threaten one (1) or more of the following:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The health or safety of any person;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>The preservation or protection of property; or</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>The continuation of necessary governmental functions.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>2410.3.</num>
    <text>The justification for emergency procurement shall not be based solely on the internal operations of the Agency. In the absence of an emergency condition, an emergency procurement shall not be justified on the basis of any of the following circumstances:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The lack of adequate advance planning for the procurement of required supplies or services;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Delays in procurement caused by administrative delays, lack of sufficient procurement personnel, or improper handling of procurement requests or competitive procedures; or</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>Pending expiration of budget authority.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>2410.4.</num>
    <text>The emergency procurement of supplies or services shall be limited to quantities or a time period sufficient to meet the immediate threat and shall not be used to meet long-term requirements.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>2410.5.</num>
    <text>The emergency procurement of services shall be limited to a period of not more than one hundred twenty (120) days.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>2410.6.</num>
    <text>If a long-term requirement for the supplies, services, or other items is anticipated, the contracting officer shall initiate a separate non-emergency procurement action as soon as possible after the emergency procurement is made.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>2410.7.</num>
    <text>A contract procured on an emergency basis shall not be modified to expand the scope or extend the time of the procurement unless a limited number of additional supplies, services, or other items are needed to fill an on-going emergency requirement
      until regular procurement action procedures can be completed.</text>
