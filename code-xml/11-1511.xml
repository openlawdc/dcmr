    <num>1511.1.</num>
    <text>The Tree and Slope Protection (TSP) Overlay District is established to preserve and enhance the park-like setting of designated neighborhoods adjacent to streams or parks by regulating alteration or disturbance of terrain, destruction of trees, and
      ground coverage of permitted buildings and other impervious surfaces.</text>

      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Prevent significant adverse impact on adjacent open space, parkland, stream beds, or other environmentally sensitive natural areas; and</text>

    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>Limit permitted ground coverage of new and expanded buildings and other construction, so as to encourage a general compatibility between the siting of new buildings and the existing neighborhood.</text>

    <num>1511.4.</num>
    <text>The TSP Overlay District is designed for residential neighborhoods that are located at the edge of stream beds or public open spaces and that have a significant quantity of steep slopes, stands of mature trees, and undeveloped lots and parcels subject
      to potential terrain alteration and tree removal. It is not suitable for mapping in neighborhoods where nearly all lots are already developed on a rectangular grid system and the existing mature trees are either yard trees or street trees.</text>
