    <text>For each procurement in an amount over one thousand dollars ($1,000), the contracting officer shall solicit quotations from at least three (3) sources to promote competition to the maximum extent practicable and to ensure that the purchase is in the
      best interests of the Agency, considering quality, price, and other factors (including the administrative cost of the purchase). If practicable, two (2) sources not included in the previous solicitation for similar items shall be requested to furnish
      quotations.</text>

    <text>If the contracting officer determines that it is impractical under the circumstances to solicit more than two (2) sources (due to time constraints, lack of available sources, or other factors set forth in ยง 2502.4), the contracting officer may solicit
      quotations from two (2) sources. In no instance shall the contracting officer solicit quotations from fewer than two (2) sources unless the provisions of ยง 2502.5 are followed.</text>
