      or evaluated, and includes the establishment of agency needs, solicitation of sources, award of contracts, contract financing, contract performance, contract administration, and those technical and management functions related to the process of

    <text>A grant is financial assistance to an organization to support or stimulate the accomplishment of a public purpose as defined by the law that authorizes the grant. For purposes of this chapter, a subgrant is the award of grant funds by the District
      to a subrecipient organization to accomplish the same public purpose.</text>

      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Is the principal purpose of the relationship the transfer of money, property, services, or anything of value to the subgrantee to accomplish a public purpose of support and stimulation authorized by statute, rather than an acquisition of goods or
        services for the direct benefit of the District government?</text>
    </level>

      <num>(c)</num>
