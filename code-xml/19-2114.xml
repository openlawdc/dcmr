    <text>In mid-ring the referee shall instruct the contestants in the following manner:</text>
    <text>“You are to box_____ rounds, under the rules of the District of Columbia. Do not hold behind the neck and punch with one hand. Do not strike a rabbit punch. Do not strike a kidney punch. Do not use backhand blows. Do not hit on the break away at any
      time. Step back cleanly, and break when I tell you to do so. Do not make me pull you apart.”</text>
    <text>“In case of a knockdown, I want the contestant scoring it to retire immediately to the neutral corner farthest removed from the knockdown and remain there until I motion him (or her) back, or I will stop counting. A contestant who has been knocked
      down shall take a count of eight. Penalties are scored in case of fouls. If you lose on a deliberate foul, your purse may be forfeited.”</text>
    <text>“Keep your punches up.”</text>
    <text>“Shake hands now and come out boxing. Do not shake again until the beginning of the last round.”</text>
