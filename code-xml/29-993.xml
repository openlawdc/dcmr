      living one-to-one services means services provided to one person exclusively by a supported living services provider who has been trained in all general requirements and possesses all training required to implement the person&amp;#8217;s specific
      behavioral and/or clinical protocols and support plans for a pre-authorized length of time. One-to-one supported living services shall be reimbursed at the daily rate of four hundred and ninety-five dollars ($495.00) for one-to-one services with
      awake overnight staff, billable in quarter hour units of five dollars and sixteen cents ($5.16) per unit. One-to-one supported living services with asleep overnight staff or for any additional people in the same house with another person receiving
      one-to-one services shall be reimbursed at the daily rate of four hundred three dollars ($403.00), billable in quarter hour units of four dollars and twenty cents ($4.20) per unit. The rate adjustment for multiple people in the same house receiving
      one-to-one services avoids duplication of administrative and management fees.</text>
