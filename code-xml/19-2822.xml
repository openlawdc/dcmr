    <text>For purposes of this section, a “claim” means a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other
      relief arising under or relating to a contract.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>2822.2.</num>
    <text>A claim arising under a contract, unlike a claim relating to that contract, is a claim that can be resolved under a contract clause that provides for the relief sought by the claimant. However, a written demand or written assertion by the contractor
      seeking the payment of money exceeding fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) is not a claim under this chapter until certified as required by subsection 2815.3</text>
