    <num>820.1.</num>

      of properly located industrial sites.</text>

    <text>Since the zoning regulations relative to operation of permitted uses are only those minimally required to protect nearby industrial and commercial uses, M Districts, whenever possible, shall not be mapped adjacent to Residence Districts.</text>
