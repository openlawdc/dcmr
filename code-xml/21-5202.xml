    <text>Employee classifications:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>

        disciplinary, non-union appeals, and reduction in force regulations and policies and procedures.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>Full-time &amp;#8211; An employee who is hired to work a regularly scheduled workweek of forty (40) or more hours or regularly scheduled to work 80 hours in a two workweek pay period.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(d)</num>
      <text>Part-time &amp;#8211; An employee who is hired to work a regularly scheduled workweek of less than twenty (20) hours, or works 1,040 hours per year or less. Part-time employees are not covered by the Authority&amp;#8217;s disciplinary, non-union
        appeals, and reduction in force regulations and policies and procedures.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(e)</num>
      <text>Probationary &amp;#8211; All new full-time employees in regular positions and all full-time employees who accept a regular position must serve a probationary period of not less than twelve (12) months. Any employee hired is a new Authority employee
        and must satisfy the probationary period requirement regardless of prior government service. Completion of the probationary period means that, in the judgment of the Authority, the employee has performed in an acceptable manner for a minimum of
        twelve (12) months. The Authority, in its discretion, may extend a probationary period up to ninety (90) days. If an employee does not complete the probationary period, the Authority may terminate his/her employment. A decision to terminate a
        probationary employee is not subject to appeal.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>5202.3.</num>
    <text>Vacancies will generally be posted for a minimum of ten (10) working days before a job is offered. Vacancies for positions designated as scarce skills, or in situations where posting of the vacancy for ten (10) working days is determined by the General
      Manager to be impossible or impractical, a vacancy may be posted for less than ten (10) working days before a job is offered. The General Manager may appoint senior management staff, executive staff, and make emergency staff appointments without
      the necessity of posting the vacancy or competing the position.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>5202.4.</num>
    <text>The Authority&amp;#8217;s Human Resources Department is responsible for recruiting candidates to fill new and vacant positions including, but not limited to, recruitment, applicant processing, screening interviews, reference checks, medical examinations,
      job offers, compensation and benefits processing, and employment records. These responsibilities may be delegated by the General Manager to another organizational component, as deemed appropriate.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>5202.5.</num>
    <text>As part of the selection process, all applicants who have been conditionally offered employment with the Authority will undergo a pre-employment medical evaluation that will include, among other things, drug screening. Any applicant whose medical
      evaluation indicates the presence of illegal drugs or an inability to perform the essential functions of a position due to mental and/or physical conditions which cannot be reasonably accommodated, will not be employed by the Authority.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>5202.6.</num>
    <text>Relatives of employees are eligible for employment by the Authority provided that such employment does not create a supervisory relationship in which the employees are in one another&amp;#8217;s chain of command. For purposes of this section, &amp;#8220;relative&amp;#8221;
      is defined as spouse, parent, parent-in-law, child, step-child, sister, brother, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, step-parent, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, niece, nephew, first cousin, grandparent or grandchild, or any other related or unrelated individual
      that resides in the same household as the employee. If a supervisory relationship is created between employees who are related, at the Authority&amp;#8217;s discretion, one employee may be reassigned noncompetitively to another position selected
      by the Authority for which the employee is qualified where involuntary displacement of another employee does not result. This reassignment may be conducted without regard to any posting or recruitment requirements. If a position cannot be identified,
      or reassignment is impossible or impractical, one employee will be required to separate from his or her Authority employment.</text>
