    <text>The EDC shall use the Level 4 study review procedures for evaluating interconnection requests when:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The nameplate capacity of the small generation facility is less than 10 MW;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>The interconnection request was not approved under a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 expedited review and the interconnection customer has submitted an interconnection request for consideration under a Level 4 study review; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>The interconnection request does not meet the criteria for qualifying for an expedited review under Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 review procedures.</text>

    <text>The Level 4 review shall be conducted in accordance with the following process:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>Within ten (10) business days from receipt of an interconnection request, the EDC shall notify the interconnection customer whether the request is complete. When the interconnection request is deemed not complete, the EDC shall provide the interconnection
        customer with a written list detailing information required to complete the interconnection request. The interconnection customer shall have ten (10) business days to provide appropriate data in order to complete the interconnection request, or
        the interconnection request shall be considered withdrawn. The parties may agree to extend the time for receipt of the additional information. The interconnection request shall be deemed complete when the required information has been provided
        by the interconnection customer, or the parties have agreed that the interconnection customer may provide additional information at a later time.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>When an interconnection request is complete, the EDC shall assign a queue position. The queue position of an interconnection request shall be used to determine the cost responsibility necessary for the facilities to accommodate the interconnection.
