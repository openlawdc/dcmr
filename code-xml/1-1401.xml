      <heading>EDITOR’S NOTE</heading>
      <text>The Bureau of Facility Management (BFM), Buildings Management Administration (BMA), referenced in this chapter in earlier editions of Title 1 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulation, was formerly a component of DAS. Subsequent to the transfer
        of real property management functions from DAS to OPM, the BFM, BMA has been redesignated the Facility Management Division. Therefore, all prior references in this chapter to the Bureau of Facility Management (or BFM) or Buildings Management Administration
        (or BMA) have been replaced with Facility Management Division (or FMD) and the Office of Property Management (or OPM), respectively. Other technical changes made to this chapter include the substitution of “Building Manager, FMD” for “Chief, BMD”
        and “Administrator, FMD” for “Associate Director, BMA.”</text>
