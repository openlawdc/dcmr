    <num>139.1.</num>
    <text>The Administration provides applicants/clients the voluntary option to request mediation, a formal dispute resolution process mandated by 34 C.F.R. § 361.57. Mediation is available whenever there is a dispute about services. Mediation is facilitated
      by an impartial qualified mediator and relies upon the good faith efforts of all interested parties to communicate in a productive manner to reach a collaborative agreement as to how the dispute should be resolved.</text>

    <num>139.2.</num>
    <text>Mediation does not involve findings of facts or the weighing of evidence, similar to a formal, impartial due process hearing. Mediation is a voluntary process and does not affect the applicant’s/client’s right to request an impartial due process hearing.
      In the event mediation is concluded without a resolution, detailed in a written mediation agreement, either party may pursue resolution through an impartial due process hearing.</text>
