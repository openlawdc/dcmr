    <num>730.2.</num>
    <text>In October 2005, the Council of the District of Columbia unanimously passed legislation amending the Animal Control Act of 1979, effective October 18, 1979 (D.C. Law 3-30; D.C. Official Code 8-1801 et seq.)(2001) which authorized the Mayor to create
      fenced-in, off-leash dog parks. The Council recognized that a significant and growing portion of residents needed safe places to recreate and exercise together with their dogs. The creation of dog parks in the District of Columbia requires a certain
      degree of flexibility, due to the density of buildings as well as the scarcity of District-owned parkland. Successful dog parks require partnerships with the community that enhance and protect the character of the neighborhood and accommodate changing
      needs.</text>
