  <level>
    <num>545.1.</num>
    <text>Erosion shall be controlled by the installation of gutters and downspouts as soon as practicable.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>545.2.</num>
    <text>Measures shall be taken to achieve a non-eroding velocity for stormwater exiting from a roof or downspout or to temporarily pipe that stormwater directly to a storm drain.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>545.3</num>
    <text>545.3 The site work shall maximize the preservation of natural vegetation and limit the removal of vegetation to that which is necessary for construction or landscaping activity.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>545.4.</num>
    <text>If site conditions preclude employment of other means of erosion control, the Department may approve installation of small dikes constructed along a low-lying perimeter area of a job site.</text>
  </level>

    <num>545.5.</num>
    <text>In an area along a waterbody, a buffer must be established:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>By not disturbing the land immediately adjacent to the waterbody, except to restore native vegetation;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Of at least twenty-five feet (25 ft) on both sides of the water body, measured perpendicular to and horizontally from the top of bank; and</text>
    </level>
    <text>With vegetation or other measure required by the Department to insure that the buffer acts as a filter to trap sediment and keep it onsite.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>545.6.</num>
    <text>The Department may approve an exception to or modification of the requirement for a project to establish a buffer if:</text>
    <text>During construction, the project employs the control measures specified in the Department-approved Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan for the project; and</text>
    <text>By the end of construction and thereafter, the project:</text>
    <text>Achieves a 1.7 inch Stormwater Retention Volume (SWRv) for the area of land disturbance within the buffer, calculated using the SWRv formula in Section 520 of this chapter, with a P equal to 1.7 inches;</text>
    <text>Applies for relief from extraordinarily difficult site conditions for a portion of the 1.7 inch SWRv and achieves the treatment and off-site retention requirements for the volume of relief granted; or</text>
    <text>Receives a Department determination to grant relief for a portion of a the 1.7 inch SWRv, on-site treatment is not feasible, and the Department approves alternatives to on-site treatment that will help to protect or restore the waterbody for which
      the buffer is intended; and</text>
    <text>The land disturbance is:</text>
    <text>Required to construct, install, or repair a:</text>
    <text>Public trail for walking, biking, and similar purposes;</text>
    <text>Public point of access for boating, fishing, or viewing a waterbody; or</text>
    <level>
      <num>(C)</num>
      <text>Stormwater outfall or other utility line; or</text>
    </level>
    <text>Required to enable development of the rest of the site in a manner that is similar to the proposed project.</text>
