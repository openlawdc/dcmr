    <text>It shall be considered a violation of Title I of the Act to discriminate against any individual on the basis of outward appearance for purposes of recruitment, hiring, or promotion. However, an employer may prescribe standards of appearance or dress
      for personnel which serve a reasonable business purpose; for example, to identify its employees to the public by means of a distinctive uniform, or to maintain a neat and clean appearance.</text>
    <text>513. 2 An employer may also prescribe standards of appearance or dress for personnel in order to prevent a danger to the health, welfare, or safety of employees or customers; for example, requiring head or hand coverings in food service jobs, or prohibiting
      loose items of clothing in jobs where the items become caught in machinery.</text>
