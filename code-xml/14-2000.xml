      <text>Unless otherwise noted, the authority for this chapter is section 302(e) of the Rental Housing Act of 1985, D.C. Law 6-10, D.C. Official Code § 42-3503.02(e) (2001) and Mayor’s Order 86-27, effective February 26, 1986, 33 DCR 1651 (March 14, 1986).</text>

      <heading>EDITOR’S NOTE</heading>
      <text>The rules relating to the Tenant Assistance Program were originally adopted by the Director of the Department of Housing and Community Development. Under Part IIA(f) and B(2) of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1987, D.C. Official Code, Vol. 3, 385
        (2001), all functions relating to the administration of the Tenant Assistance Program were transferred from the Director of the Department of Housing and Community Development (“DHCD”) to the Director of the Department of Public and Assisted Housing
        (“DPAH”). D.C. Law 10-243, the “District of Columbia Housing Authority Act of 1994,” abolished the Department of Public and Assisted Housing (DPAH) and established the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA) as a corporate body and legal
        instrumentality of the government of the District of Columbia. D.C. Law 13-105, the “District of Columbia Housing Authority Act of 1999,” repealed D.C. Law 10-243 and re-established the DCHA as an independent authority of the District government
        and the successor in interest to the former housing authority. Accordingly, the term “Director” in chapters 17 through 21 of this title refers to the Director of the DCHA.</text>
