        for resolution, except when the complainant has expressed a reason for not first making the request of the Provider and that reason is the basis of the complaint. The ADA Coordinator shall promptly notify both the complainant and the Provider
        of the referral and inform the complainant and the Provider that the ADA Coordinator will consider the matter resolved unless the complainant files a new complaint.</text>

        reach a solution acceptable to both parties. If the Provider is a subcontractor or subgrantee of a Department contractor or grantee, the ADA Coordinator will work through the Department’s contractor or grantee, to the extent possible; and</text>

        Services Administration of each referral of an ADA Complaint to OPRMI.</text>
