    <num>4603.1.</num>
    <text>The CCO may delegate contracting authority to employees of the Hospital, or employees of the District of Columbia government acting on behalf of the Hospital, who shall be designated as Contracting Officers. Any such delegation shall be in writing
      and shall specify any limits on a Contracting Officer’s delegated authority (for example, limits on the dollar value of contracts the individual is authorized to award).</text>

    <num>4603.2.</num>
    <text>In delegating contracting authority, the CCO shall ensure that each delegated Contracting Officer has the experience, knowledge, and judgment necessary to fulfill the duties of a Contracting Officer, including a solid understanding of the Hospital’s
      procurement rules. Subject to compliance with these rules, Contracting Officers shall have wide latitude to exercise business judgment in conducting procurements. Consequently, the ability to exercise that discretion wisely and responsibly is an
      important job qualification. In addition, the CCO shall ensure that Contracting Officers periodically receive training to strengthen and update their skills and knowledge concerning procurement matters.</text>
