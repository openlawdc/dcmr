  <heading>INTRODUCTION (ยง 14-9500)
    <text>The District of Columbia Housing Authority&amp;#8217;s (DCHA) Local Rent Supplementrogram (LRSP) is authorized and funded with annual appropriations by theistrict of Columbia government. The intent of the LRSP is to increase the stockf permanent affordable
      housing units in the District of Columbia. It isesigned to complement the Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP) which is fundedy the federal government and administered by the DCHA. Similar to HCVP, theRSP is designed so that households contribute
      thirty percent (30%) of theirdjusted annual income toward the cost for housing. The LRSP will pay theifference in the cost of housing. The LRSP has three types of housingssistance: Tenant-based, Project-based, and Sponsor- based. For the most part,nd
      unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, the LRSP follows the rules andegulations of the HCVP program as may be amended from time to time. Some of theifferences between LRSP and HCVP, as specified more fully herein, are that LRSPs not for housing
      outside of the District of Columbia and the preferences andriorities for the housing assistance are different than those specified in theCVP rules and regulations.</text>
