      form provided by the Taxi Smart Meter System that contains, at a minimum, all information required by ยง823.2. An electronic manifest must be capable of providing a printed record immediately upon request by a Hack Inspector, law enforcement personnel,
      or other Commission personnel.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>823.2.</num>
    <text>The manifest shall be the same form as Appendix 8-3 and should contain, but not be limited to, the following:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The date, operator&amp;#8217;s identification card number, taxicab company, vehicle number, and license plate number;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>The interstate mileage at the beginning and ending of an interstate trip;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>The time and place of origin and time and place of destination of each trip;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(d)</num>
      <text>The number of passengers and fare charged for each trip; and</text>

      <num>(e)</num>
      <text>The time and interstate mileage at the end of the workday.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>823.3.</num>
    <text>A complete and accurate record of all information required on the manifest shall be kept, and each trip record shall be logged immediately following completion of the trip.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>823.4.</num>
    <text>The manifest shall be kept on file and available for a period of two (2) years. The manifest shall be provided to the Commission upon demand and to any authorized agency of the District of Columbia or the United States Government.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>823.5.</num>
    <text>The daily manifest shall not be altered in any manner. Evidence of alternation may include, but is not limited to, changing or striking out any of the information required by ยง 823.2, attempting to manipulate the manifest provided by the Taxi Smart
      Meter System or completing the manifest with false information after it has been requested by a Hack Inspector, law enforcement personnel, or other Commission personnel. An altered manifest represents a failure to properly complete and maintain
      a manifest and any corresponding violation represented by the actual alteration, such as a failure to charge proper fare or a failure to haul when on duty, for which fines are provided in this chapter. However, when applicable a correction of a
      written, rather than an electronic, manifest by an operator is permitted when a mistake or error is struck out, initialed, and dated by the operator.</text>

    <num>823.6.</num>

      public vehicles for hire picking up passengers in the District of Columbia pursuant to ยง 828.</text>
