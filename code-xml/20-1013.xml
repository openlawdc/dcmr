    <num>1013.1.</num>
    <text>The Director shall conduct an audit of the NOx Budget Program beginning in 2002 and every three (3) years thereafter to ensure that the program is providing expected performance regarding emissions monitoring and allowance use. The audits shall include,
      as appropriate, confirmation of emissions reporting accuracy through validation of CEMS and data acquisition systems at the budget source, and review of allowance transfer and use by budget sources measured by geographic distribution and daily emission
      totals. Each periodic audit will examine the extent to which banked allowances have, or have not, contributed to emissions in excess of the budget for each year preceding the audit. The periodic audit shall further provide an assessment that the
      program is consistent with the requirements for reasonable further progress and the attainment demonstration.</text>
