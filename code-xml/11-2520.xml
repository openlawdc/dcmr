  <level>
    <num>2520.1.</num>
    <text>The purposes for the regulation of antennas as a particular type of structure shall be as follows:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The Zoning Commission has determined that certain antennas, because of their size, shape, design, construction, or location may affect the health, welfare, or safety of the population and may detract from the streetscape, landscape, skyline, scenic
        beauty, or aesthetic interests of Washington, D.C., and its role as the Nation&amp;#8217;s Capital;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>The Zoning Regulations therefore regulate the size, height, construction, design, and location of antennas and antenna structures that have the greatest potential for adverse impact on the health, safety, and welfare of the population and on neighborhood
        quality, and those which have the greatest potential for adverse impact on the scenic beauty of the Nation&amp;#8217;s Capital; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>The principal types of antennas regulated are those that, because of their shape and relatively large mass, potentially have the greatest visual impact and include, by example, large satellite earth station antennas and certain microwave terrestrial
        antennas.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>2520.2.</num>
    <text>If the Zoning Administrator determines that an antenna does not meet the definition of any specific class of an antenna in ยง 199.1, the Zoning Administrator shall determine the class of antenna to which it is closest and treat the antenna accordingly.</text>
