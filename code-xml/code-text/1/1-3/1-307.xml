    <text>ODAI shall accept electronic submissions of documents. A person seeking to submit a document to ODAI shall sign onto the e-rulemaking system at www.dcregs.org and submit the document. Submissions should be in Microsoft Word format. Rulemaking submissions
      should adhere to the rules in §307.9-307.15 of this chapter.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>307.2.</num>
    <text>All documents submitted to ODAI shall adhere to the ODAI Handbook and Style manual. The requirements include:</text>
    <text>a) To be eligible for publication in the D.C. Register, a document must be formatted for eight and one-half inch by eleven inch (8½ in. x 11 in.) white, opaque paper. The text must be set within margins not less than one (1) inch on all sides</text>
    <text>b) The preferred Font family for all ODAI publications is Times New Roman, in 12 point size with “Automatic” font color. The use of color in type faces or charts is discouraged, to enable ease of reading when printed in black and white.</text>
    <text>c) All documents submitted for publication in the D.C. Register must be single-spaced. Extra single spaces between paragraphs or sections, as well as additional spaces between major divisions of documents, are generally acceptable. Documents should
      be prepared with attention to the ease of reading.</text>
    <text>d) Documents should be prepared to be read vertically. Charts or other materials which cannot be reproduced in vertical form may be accepted for publication. In such cases, the text should be prepared for publication so that the top of the text will
      appear on the left margin of the page.</text>
    <text>e) Documents generally should not be signed on the originals, except Council acts and Mayor&amp;#8217;s Orders. Signed originals or copies are not acceptable as substitutes for the signature required on the transmittal form.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>307.5.</num>
    <text>Documents on letterhead and documents in the form of letters or memoranda are generally not acceptable for publication in the D.C. Register.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>307.6.</num>
    <text>Except when considered necessary by the Administrator, blank forms for applications, registrations, reports, contracts, and similar items, and the instructions for preparing the forms, may not be published in full. A brief description or list of forms
      describing the purpose and use of each form, as well as where copies of the form(s) may be obtained (website address, telephone number, etc), may be submitted for publication.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>307.7.</num>
    <text>After a document has been submitted for publication, a substantive error in the text may be corrected only by the filing of another document making the correction. Pending the receipt of the corrected document, the Office of Documents and Administrative
      Issuances should be informed by telephone or email to dcdocuments@dc.gov of the need to withhold publication pending the submission of the corrected document.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>307.8.</num>
    <text>If a document has been adopted by a legislative or quasi-legislative body in session, substantive or technical errors in the documents as adopted will not be corrected by the Office of Documents and Administrative Issuances unless the correction is
      approved by the body in public session or the correction is made pursuant to the lawful adopted procedural rules of the body.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>307.9.</num>
    <text>All documents submitted for publication in the D.C. Register shall be submitted on the e-rulemaking system. Anyone wishing to submit documents must obtain a log-on and password from the Office of Documents and Administrative Issuances. The request
      for a log-on and password shall be submitted in writing to dcdocuments@dc.gov. The request shall include the name of the agency, the name of the person with rulemaking authority for the agency, and the contact information for the agency liaison
      requesting the information and access to the e-rulemaking system. The Administrator of ODAI will create the log-on and password for the rulemaking authority and deliver the information. The rulemaking authority may create additional profiles for
      his or her agency staff.</text>

    <num>307.10</num>
    <text>307.10 In place of a transmittal form, the agency drafter shall sign on to the e-rulemaking system with the drafter’s individual password. Electronic submissions will be taken as a confirmation that the document was submitted by the designated agency
      drafter. Any submissions not personally executed by the authorized official and submissions by those not legally vested with authority to adopt rules or attest to the adoption of rules by a rulemaking body will not be accepted.</text>
  </level>

    <num>307.11</num>
    <text>307.11 The Office of the Attorney General will electronically submit approval of rulemakings to the Office of Documents and Administrative Issuances through the e-rulemaking system. Signed transmittal forms are no longer required by ODAI for electronic
      submissions on the e-rulemaking system. However, any paper submissions by offices unable to access the e-rulemaking system must be submitted with a transmittal form that contains the signature of the Office of the Attorney General or Agency Counsel,
      designated Assistant Attorney General, or approved agency counsel certifying that the substance of the text of the rule(s) has been reviewed and is, in the opinion of legal counsel, legally sufficient.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>307.12.</num>
    <text>Certification of legal sufficiency, by the Office of the Attorney General or Agency General Counsel, must be included with all rulemaking actions. Certification of proposed rules may be conditioned upon review of final rules. If the substance of proposed
      rules for which final certification has been given is not modified prior to final rulemaking action, the final rules do not require duplicate certification.</text>
