    <text>When the Government is seeking a civil fine, it must file a Notice of Infraction or a Notice of Violation, as authorized by law, at OAH. The Government may not file a Notice of Infraction, under the Civil Infractions Act, without complying with Subsection
      2803.5, and may not file a Notice of Violation, under the Litter Control Administration Act, without complying with Subsection 2803.8.</text>

    <text>The Government must provide a copy of the Notice of Infraction or Notice of Violation to the Respondent (the person or entity that the Government wants to pay the fine) in the manner specified in the Civil Infractions Act, the Litter Control Administration
      Act, or other applicable law.</text>
  </level>

      after the date that it mailed the Notice of Infraction. When it files the Notice of Infraction, the Government also must file an affidavit, on a form approved by the Chief Administrative Law Judge, verifying that the United States Postal Service
      (USPS) did not return the Notice of Infraction to the Government.</text>

    <text>In a Litter Control Administration Act case, if the Government sends a Notice of Violation to a Respondent by certified mail, the Government must file a copy of a signed certified mail receipt or other proof that the USPS delivered the Notice of Violation
      to the Respondent’s address. If the USPS returns the certified mail to the Government, the Government may file proof of any alternative service of the Notice of Violation.</text>

    <text>When it files a Notice of Infraction or a Notice of Violation, the Government must file a copy of all exhibits it expects to offer at any hearing in the case and must provide a copy of each exhibit to the Respondent. An Administrative Law Judge may
      allow the Government to use exhibits that it did not file or provide in accordance with this Subsection if there is no prejudice to the Respondent.</text>
