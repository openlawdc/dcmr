    <text>The Board shall not accept any challenge which, on its face, does not allege defects in the petition which, if valid, would render the prospective candidate ineligible.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>1309.5.</num>
    <text>The Board may, on its own motion, dismiss a petition challenge where the total number of challenged signatures would not reduce the total number of signatures submitted by the proposer(s) below the required statutory amount.</text>
