  <heading>SKILLED OR INTERMEDIATE NURSING CARE FACILITIES (ยง 29-904)</heading>

    <num>904.1.</num>
    <text>In recognition of the fact that many Medicaid patients require more nursing care than the program presently will pay for, and therefore, it is difficult to locate sufficient placements for Medicaid patients, effective not later than June 5, 1983,
      the District Medicaid program shall eliminate the present ceiling on the number of allowable nursing hours that may be claimed for reimbursement. While this action will increase federal reimbursement for District long term care facilities, this
      increase will be offset by increased costs for placements.</text>
