    <num>972.1.</num>
    <text>The standards established in this section are to provide guidance in determining whether certain cost items will be recognized as allowable base year costs. In the absence of specific instructions or guidelines, each facility shall follow the principles

    <text>Bed Occupancy Allowance &amp;#8211; For purposes of calculating the base year cost, each facility shall maintain at a minimum an average annual occupancy rate of 85%. For each facility with less than an 85% occupancy rate, the bed occupancy allowance
      shall be computed using an 85% factor instead of the lower, actual percentage of occupancy. A reserved bed paid under Medical Assistance shall be counted as an occupied bed. The occupancy level adjustment is applicable to fixed costs, such as depreciation,
      rent, interest, insurance and taxes. The occupancy level adjustment does not apply to variable costs such as staffing and food, since these costs decrease as the occupancy level decreases.</text>
