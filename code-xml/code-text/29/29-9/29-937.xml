    <text>Behavioral support services are services designed to support and encourage the person in his or her decision to reside within the community; decrease the impact of a behavioral event; assist the person in developing alternative and more effective
      communication, adaptive and coping mechanisms; and enable the person to achieve positive personal outcomes. These services shall be available to all Waiver-eligible persons to prevent any unnecessary change in placement; placement in a more restrictive
      environment; prevent a psychiatric hospitalization; enhance the person&amp;#8217;s ability to lead a more typical life; and support the positive development of community living skills and social relationships.</text>

      behavior. The BSP should emphasize positive, proactive and effective strategies, and should minimize and seek to eliminate the use of restricted or intrusive procedures for the individual and circumstance. The BSP may also include the limited use
      of restrictive procedures, but only with the consent and approval of the person and/or their guardian, the agreement of the individual&amp;#8217;s support team, and the written approval of the Department on Disability Services (DDS) Human Rights
