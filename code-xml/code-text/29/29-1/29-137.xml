    <text>An informal administrative review meeting is a non-binding and non-adversarial informal dispute resolution process pursuant to 34 C.F.R. ยง 361.57 (c). The informal administrative review meeting process provides an applicant or consumer an opportunity
      to meet with the Chief of VRSD or the Chief of DSB in an effort to expeditiously resolve a complaint he or she may have about any determination concerning the furnishing or denial of vocational rehabilitation services. The informal administrative
      review meeting may involve fact gathering, interviews and negotiation. The informal administrative review meeting is optional and voluntary, and will not deny or delay an applicant or consumer from pursuing any other due process remedy guaranteed
      by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.</text>
