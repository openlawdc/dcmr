    <text>There shall be two types of auction permits under this section. A public auction permit shall authorize either (1) a licensee who is going out of business or had its license not renewed or revoked, or (2) the licensee&amp;#8217;s successor, to auction
      alcoholic beverages for sale at the Board approved location that may be taken off the premises by the purchasing party. A personal auction permit shall authorize the holder of the permit to auction off for sale the personal alcoholic beverage stock
      of an individual or his or her estate at the Board approved location that may be taken off the premises by the purchasing party. A personal auction permit to sell alcoholic beverages at an estate sale may be obtained by either an off-premises retailer
      or wholesaler licensed to carry the products being sold or an individual or corporate entity without an ABC license. However, a personal auction permit to sell an individual&amp;#8217;s own private alcoholic beverage stock not related to an estate
      sale must be obtained by an off-premises retailer or wholesaler licensed to carry the products being sold.</text>
