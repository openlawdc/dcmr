    <text>The Board shall respond to all such letters in writing, and may refer the writer directly to a member of the ABRA Staff, to a specific section of the Act or this title, or to other District of Columbia government officials. The response may also suggest
      that the writer retain the services of an attorney to properly advise him or her as to how to proceed in a particular matter. If the writer&amp;#8217;s inquiry is so broad, inexact, or vague that the Board is unable to respond, the Board shall so
      advise the writer and may request that the writer provide additional information.</text>
