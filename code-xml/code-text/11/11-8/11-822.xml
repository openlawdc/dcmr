    <text>In determining whether to grant a special exception, the Board shall not take into consideration whether the District of Columbia government issued the applicant an interim operating permit for the facility. The granting of a special exception to
      a facility does not authorize that facility to operate, unless the facility has been granted all other forms of permission required for solid waste handling facilities, including, but not limited to, a valid interim operating permit or solid waste
      facility permit. A solid waste handling facility that has been granted a special exception remains obligated to abide by all laws applicable to solid waste handling facilities and is subject to all claims or enforcement actions that may arise from

  </level>
  <level>
    <num>822.10.</num>
    <text>An applicant seeking a special exception for an EEF shall demonstrate, in addition to the requirements of § 3104, that the proposed use will not, as a consequence of its design, operation, low employee presence, or proximity to other EEFs, inhibit
      future revitalization of the neighborhood, reduce the potential for vibrant streetscapes, deplete street life, or inhibit pedestrian or vehicular traffic.</text>

    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>822.12.</num>
    <text>The Board, in weighing the potentially adverse factors listed in § 822.11(a) through (d), shall consider the economic development potential of the area in which the EEF is proposed to be established and shall give greater negative weight to these
      factors if the EEF is to be located in proximity to an existing or proposed Metrorail station or along a pedestrian corridor.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>822.13.</num>
    <text>The Board may give positive weight to any economic benefits that the proposed EEF will have on adjacent properties, including the potential for increased business activity within the neighborhood, if that activity will foster economic development.</text>
