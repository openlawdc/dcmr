    <num>724.2.</num>
    <text>There is a definite mathematical relationship between the figures in columns 2 and 3 of the table in § 724.1. If the decelerations set forth in column 3 are divided by 32.2 ft/sec., the column 2 figures will be obtained. (For example, 17 divided by
      32.2 gives 52.8%) Column 2 is included in the table because certain brake-testing devices utilize this factor.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>724.3.</num>
    <text>The decelerations in column 3 of the table are an indication of the effectiveness of the basic brakes and, as measured in practical brake testing, are the maximum braking decelerations attained at some time during the stop. This deceleration, as measured
      in brake tests, cannot be used to compute the values in column 4 of the table because it is not sustained at the same rate over the entire period of the stop. The deceleration increases from zero to a maximum during a period of brake-system application
      and brake-force buildup. Also, other factors may cause the deceleration to decrease after reaching the maximum. The added distance which results because a maximum deceleration is not sustained is included in the figures in column 4 but is not indicated
      by the usual brake-testing device for checking deceleration.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>724.4.</num>
    <text>The values in column 4 of the table and the values in column 3 are not directly related. Column 4 is a definite measure of the overall effectiveness of the braking system, being the distance traveled between the point at which the driver starts to
      move the braking controls and the point at which the vehicle comes to rest. It includes distance traveled while the brakes are being applied and the distance traveled while the brakes are retarding the vehicle.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>724.5.</num>
    <text>The distance traveled during the period of brake system application and brake force build-up varies with vehicle type, being negligible for many passenger cars and greatest for combinations of commercial vehicles. This fact accounts for the variation
      from twenty-five to fifty feet (25 ft. to 50 ft.) in the numerical values in column 4 for the various classes.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>724.6.</num>
    <text>The deceleration value in column 3 of the table is the same for all classifications except passenger vehicles (other than buses) because brakes on vehicles in the B, C, and D classifications are capable with reasonable maintenance of producing the
      required decelerations as measured by brake-testing devices. A higher deceleration value is warranted for passenger cars by Bureau of Public Roads test data.</text>
