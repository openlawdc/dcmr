  <heading>LIMITED OCCUPATIONAL LICENSES (§ 18-310)</heading>
  <level>
    <num>310.1.</num>
    <text>Except as provided in § 310.7, a person whose regular driver&amp;#8217;s license, as described in § 1312.1 (a), is revoked, suspended or canceled may request, in writing, that the order be modified to allow the issuance or retention of a driver&amp;#8217;s
      license or privilege on a limited basis. An examiner shall not grant the application unless the applicant demonstrates that the suspension or revocation imposes an extreme hardship for which there is no practical remedy and, in the judgment of the
      examiner, the safety of the public will not be impaired. The determination shall be based solely upon the written application.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>310.2.</num>
    <text>In order to show extreme hardship, the applicant for an occupational license must show to the satisfaction of the examiner that loss of operating privileges precludes carrying out the applicant’s normal business, trade or occupation, and that driving
      is necessary to support the applicant and his or her family.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>310.3.</num>
    <text>In considering whether a limited license can be issued in the interest of the public safety and welfare, the examiner shall determine the general good character of the applicant, the number and seriousness of the violations on the applicant’s traffic
      record, the period of time over which the violations were accumulated, the number and seriousness of violations committed by the applicant during the hours or in the area, or both, for which applicant desires the license, the ease or difficulty
      of enforcement of the conditions and limitations of the license, and the probable impact, so far as the examiner can determine, of the limitation on the future driving conduct of the applicant.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>310.4.</num>
    <text>The applicant may prove his or her general good character by submitting with the application letters of recommendation from responsible business people, the employer of the applicant, law enforcement officers, judicial officials, or other credible
      persons.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>310.5.</num>
    <text>If the applicant operates a commercial vehicle as a livelihood, the application shall be accompanied by a written request from the applicant’s employer that the license be issued.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>310.6.</num>
    <text>When an occupational license is issued, the period of suspension or revocation may be increased over that of the original suspension or revocation period to the extent that, in the judgment of the examiner, the increase is justified to carry out the
      intent under this title of protecting the public interest in safe driving and of improving the driving habits of applicants for licenses.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>310.7.</num>

    <text>A limited license may be issued with restrictions that will permit business use only, daylight hours only, driving to and from work, or any other limited use which, in the opinion of the hearing examiner is appropriate in carrying out the purpose
      of this section.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>310.9.</num>
    <text>An occupational license shall be expressly conditioned on the licensee’s compliance with all traffic laws and rules. Any violation, other than parking infractions, shall result in the immediate revocation of the occupational license and the doubling
