    <text>When, by notice given under this chapter, or by order or decision of an Examiner, an act is required or allowed to be done at or within a specified time, the Examiner for cause shown may, at any time in his or her discretion, do either of the following:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>With or without motion or notice, order the period enlarged, if request therefor is made before the expiration of the period originally prescribed or as extended by a previous order; or</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Upon motion made after expiration of the specified period, permit the act to be done where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect and only then in extraordinary cases where the denial of an enlargement of time would operate to deny
        a person adversely affected thereby any opportunity to notice and hearing.</text>
    </level>
  </level>

    <num>1001.2.</num>
    <text>In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this chapter, by notice, order, rule, or regulation of the Department, or by statute, the day of the act, event, or default after which the designated period of time begins to run is not to
      be included.</text>

  </level>
  <level>
    <num>1001.4.</num>
    <text>Whenever a party has the right or is required to take action within the period prescribed by this chapter, by a notice given thereunder, or by an order or regulation, the examiner may, before the expiration of the prescribed period, with or without
      notice, extend the period; or, upon motion, permit the act to be done after the expiration of the specified period, where the failure to act is clearly shown to have been the result of excusable neglect.</text>
