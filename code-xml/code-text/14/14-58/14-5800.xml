    <text>DCHA takes several steps to avoid recommending participant families and Owners for termination from the Program. Prior to making a Recommendation for Termination (RFT), DCHA will provide notice to the affected party/parties that includes a description
      of the violation, an explanation that failure to correct the violation may result in a recommendation for termination, and instructions on what must be done to correct the violation.</text>

    <text>Before DCHA makes a recommendation for termination, there are several opportunities for a Family or Owner to cure or explain the circumstances surrounding the violation. These include:</text>
    <text>Walk-in Appointment days;</text>
    <text>Scheduled informal meetings; and</text>
    <text>Reviewing reasonable accommodation requests that pertain to the recommendation for termination.</text>
