  <heading>APPLYING UTILITY ALLOWANCES (§ 14-5311)</heading>
  <level>
    <num>5311.1.</num>
    <text>The utility allowance is calculated for each Family based upon DCHA’s utility allowance schedule, which is based on the average utility costs for a unit of comparable size. DCHA shall periodically update the utility allowance to account for increases
      in energy costs. The allowances set by DCHA are applicable to all program types.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>5311.2.</num>
    <text>A DCHA-established utility allowance schedule is used in determining Family share and HAP. DCHA shall use the appropriate utility allowance for the size of dwelling unit actually leased by a Family rather than the voucher unit size for which the Family
      qualifies using DCHA subsidy standards.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>5311.3.</num>
    <text>DCHA shall approve a utility allowance amount higher than shown on DCHA’s schedule if a higher allowance is needed as a reasonable accommodation for a Family member with a disability, in accordance with DCHA’s procedures regarding reasonable accommodation.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>5311.4.</num>
    <text>In the event of an interim recertification, DCHA shall use the current utility allowance schedule. Revised utility allowances shall be applied to a Family’s rent and subsidy calculations at the first regular recertification that is effective after
      the allowance is adopted.</text>
