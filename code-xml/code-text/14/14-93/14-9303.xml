    <text>Partnership Program subsidy may be provided for up to one hundred percent (100%) of the units in a qualified property if the property is a single-family house or units that are specifically for households comprised of elderly families, disabled families,
      families receiving supportive services, to the extent permitted under federal funding restrictions, or as otherwise permitted by action of the DCHA Board of Commissioners. The maximum percentage available can be determined by contacting DCHA&amp;#8217;s

    <num>9303.3.</num>
    <text>The initial and subsequent rents paid under the Housing Assistance Payment Contract (Contract Rents) will be based upon an analysis of the reasonableness of the proposed rent in the neighborhood in which the property is located.</text>

    <text>For Fiscal Year 2002, 2003, and 2004, FMRs will be based on the 50th percentile of rents in the Metropolitan Statistical Area. The current FMRs are available by contacting the Housing Choice Voucher Program.</text>

    <text>DCHA may, after review by the Board of Commissioners, enter into a Housing Assistance Payment contract where the percentage of the total units to be subsidized exceeds 50% of the units, provided that the total operating subsidy is reasonable and necessary
      and not in excess of the funds necessary for the financial viability and proper operation of the property. Each unit and household occupying a voucher assisted unit is subject to Section 9312.7 as well as all other program requirements.</text>
