    <num>311.1.</num>
    <text>The interest in the escrow account described in § 309 on all money paid by the tenant prior to or during the tenancy as a security deposit, decorating fee, or similar deposit or fee, shall commence on the date the money is actually paid by the tenant,
      or within thirty (30) days after February 20, 1976, whichever is later, and shall accrue at not less than the statement savings rate then prevailing on January 1st and on July 1st for each 6-month period (or part thereof) of the tenancy which follows
      those dates. On those dates, the statement savings rate in the District of Columbia financial institution in which the escrow account is held shall be used. All interest earned shall accrue to the tenant except for that described in paragraph (4)(a-1)
      or as set forth in paragraph (2) (14 DCMR § 309).</text>

    <num>311.2.</num>
    <text>Interest on an escrow account shall be due and payable by the owner to the tenant upon termination of any tenancy of a duration of twelve (12) months or more, unless an amount is deducted under procedures set forth in paragraph (2) (14 DCMR §§ 309.1
      and 309.2). Any housing provider violating the provisions of this section by failing to pay interest on a security deposit escrow account that is rightfully owed to a tenant in accordance with the requirements of this section, shall be liable to
      the Rent Administrator or Rental Housing Commission, as applicable, for the amount of the interest owed, or in the event of bad faith, for treble that amount. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term &amp;#8220;bad faith&amp;#8221; means any
      frivolous or unfounded refusal to return a security deposit, as required by law, that is motivated by a fraudulent, deceptive, misleading, dishonest, or unreasonably self-serving purpose and not by simple negligence, bad judgment, or an honest belief
      in the course of action taken. Any housing provider who willfully violates the provisions of this section by failing to pay interest on a security deposit escrow account that is rightfully owed to a tenant in accordance with the requirements of
      this section shall be subject to a civil fine of not more than $ 5000 for each violation.</text>

        interest for administrative costs or other purposes.</text>
