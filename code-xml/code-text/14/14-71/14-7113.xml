    <text>The evaluation of an employee’s performance is intended to assist the employee to become a more effective worker through standards of performance established by the supervisor. In no event is an employee’s employment performance record a substitute
      for disciplinary action under the personnel policy and procedures. However, the performance evaluation must be used to establish attempted non-disciplinary corrective action in support of subsequent disciplinary action for unsatisfactory work performance.
      The Performance Appraisal (PA) is intended to cover over-all performance during a specific period of time. The PA shall be made a permanent part of the employee’s file.</text>
