    <text>No employee shall receive a step increase whose performance is rated less than fully successful. The performance of such employees shall be re-evaluated for up to three (3) months, in conjunction with the Disciplinary Performance Probationary period,
      until a “fully successful” or better rating is achieved or the employment is terminated. Once an employee achieves a fully successful or better rating, a step increase will be granted and the anniversary date for future step increases changed to
      the date of the delayed increase.</text>
