    <num>7115.1.</num>
    <text>A permanent employee, who is not serving a promotion probationary period, may be placed on probation as a disciplinary measure or as a result of a less than a “fully successful” Performance Appraisal. The supervisor must state, in writing, the steps
      the employee must take to improve his or her conduct or performance. If it is determined that an employee is to be placed on disciplinary performance probation for a period of evaluation, the period of probation shall not exceed three (3) months.
      Receipt of a less than “fully successful” performance appraisal at the completion of the three-month (3) period may result in removal under the provisions outlined in § 7111.</text>
