    <num>7120.1.</num>
    <text>Sick leave is paid leave granted to employees to be used when an employee is incapacitated by sickness or injury, or disability, as certified by a physician’s certificate, for disabilities caused, or contributed to, by pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion,
      childbirth and recovery therefrom, for medical, dental or optical examination or treatment, for necessary care and attendance during illness of children, spouse, or the employee’s immediate family. The family is defined as persons related by blood,
      marriage, or adoption, as well as employees involved in relationships characterized by the permanence, duration and stability normally associated with family relationships or marriage. Use of sick leave for any other purpose should be considered
      abuse of this policy and may subject the employee to disciplinary action.</text>
