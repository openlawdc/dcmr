    <text>The Authority may offer alternative workplace arrangements. Flexi-place is a management option rather than an employee benefit and does not change the terms and conditions of appointment. Employee participation is voluntary and subject to management
      approval. An employee who works flexi-place (other than for short periods) must sign an agreement with the Authority. Canceling flexi-place arrangement is effected by either the employee or the supervisor, with notice, and in accordance with Authority
      procedures.</text>
