    <num>4619.12.</num>
    <text>The Contracting Officer shall endeavor to include with every IFB solicitation the form of the contract that the contractor will be required to enter into. To the greatest extent possible, the Contracting Officer should endeavor to provide clear and
      concise contract documents. Contracts which consist of the solicitation, the proposal, and other documents attached together but not integrated into a single contract document are discouraged.</text>
