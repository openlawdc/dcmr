  <heading>BASIC ORDERING AGREEMENTS (§ 27-4615)</heading>
  <level>
    <num>4615.1.</num>
    <text>Under basic ordering agreements (also known as task order contracts or term contracts), the contractor’s performance obligations are triggered when the Contracting Officer subsequently issues task orders pursuant to the contract.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4615.2.</num>
    <text>Basic ordering agreements include:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>Requirements contracts; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Indefinite quantities contracts.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4615.3.</num>
    <text>A requirements contract provides the mechanism for the Contracting Officer to order from the contractor all of its requirements for designated supplies or services during a specified period (subject to any maximum ordering limitation in the contract).
      This type of contract should only be used when the Contracting Officer determines that a requirements contract will provide superior economic benefits to an indefinite quantity contract as it locks the Contracting Officer into one (1) source of
      supply for the goods or services required under the basic ordering agreement. A requirements contract must be approved by the CCO in addition to the Contracting Officer.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4615.4.</num>
    <text>An indefinite quantity contract provides for an indefinite quantity, within specified limits, of supplies or services to be furnished during a fixed period.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4615.5.</num>
    <text>An indefinite quantity contract:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>Requires the Hospital to order and the contractor to deliver at least the stated minimum quantity of supplies or services; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Requires the contractor to deliver any additional quantities the Hospital may order during the contract period (subject to any maximum quantity limitations in the contract).</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4615.6.</num>
    <text>The Contracting Officer may award a single indefinite quantity contract for particular goods or services, or may award multiple contracts and choose between the selected contractors in awarding subsequent delivery orders.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4615.7.</num>
    <text>If an indefinite quantity contract is used, the Contracting Officer shall establish, at the time the basic ordering agreements are awarded, a procedure by which work will be awarded under the basic ordering agreements (“award procedure”).</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4615.8.</num>
    <text>Generally, one (1) of the following two (2) award procedures shall be used:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The rotating award procedure, where work is assigned on a rotation basis (that is, the first task order is given to Contractor A, the second task order to Contractor B, etc.); or</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>The competitive award procedure, where the Contracting Officer requests task order proposals from two (2) or more contractors holding an indefinite delivery contract.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4615.9.</num>
    <text>The competitive award procedure is preferred.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4615.10.</num>
    <text>If the competitive award procedure is used, each task order request shall specify:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The specific goods or services required;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>A delivery date; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>Such other information as the Contracting Officer may reasonably request.</text>
