  <heading>PREPARING SOLICITATIONS (§ 27-4709)</heading>
  <level>
    <num>4709.1.</num>
    <text>After conducting market research, the Contracting Officer shall make a determination as to which procurement method identified in these regulations is most beneficial to the Department. The Department will ordinarily prepare a solicitation requesting
      responses; however, the Department may determine to purchase the required goods or services through its small purchase procedures or from a federal or District supply schedule contract.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4709.2.</num>
    <text>When the Department issues a solicitation, its length and contents will depend on factors such as the size of the procurement, the nature and complexity of the goods or services, the contracting procedure to be used, and the contract type. In general,
      however, a solicitation should clearly describe the Department’s needs (for example, by providing a statement of work outlining the type of services required or information specifying product characteristics or capabilities) and its evaluation criteria.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4709.3.</num>
    <text>In preparing a solicitation, the Department should seek to enhance competition by carefully scrutinizing and eliminating, to the extent possible, any unnecessary requirements that may restrict the number of prospective sources or the range of goods
      or services they can offer. Such provisions may include, for example, technical specifications that unnecessarily limit the competitive field, unnecessarily aggressive delivery schedules, or burdensome terms and conditions that might deter smaller
      companies from competing.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4709.4.</num>
    <text>The Department may issue solicitations in paper form or electronically. The Department may also use oral solicitations where efficient and practical (for example, where the procurement does not involve extensive specifications, detailed evaluation
      criteria, or numerous line items), and those oral solicitations shall direct that proposals be submitted in writing. Oral solicitations shall not be used for contracts that have an estimated value in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4709.5.</num>
    <text>The Department may cancel a solicitation or reject all bids or proposals received at any time before the contract award when cancellation is in the Department’s best interests.</text>
