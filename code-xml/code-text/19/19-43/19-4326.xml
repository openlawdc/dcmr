  <level>
    <num>4326.11.</num>
    <text>A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract may be in either a completion form or level-of-effort form. The completion form shall be the preferred form. A completion form requires the contractor to provide a concrete end product based on a definite goal or target
      specified in the statement of work. The level-of-effort form calls for the contractor&amp;#8217;s services (time and effort) rather than a concrete end product. The level-of-effort form reimburses the contractor&amp;#8217;s incurred costs (within
      a specified ceiling) and is paid a fixed fee based on satisfactory performance.</text>
