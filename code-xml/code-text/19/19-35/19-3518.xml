    <num>3518.1.</num>
    <text>All operating programs shall be required to maintain records of the number of participants served. Participant records shall be kept as follows:</text>
    <text>a. To ensure proper tracking of services to youth, all programs shall be required to have their program participants sign in daily, except as provided in the following paragraph. A sign-in sheet, showing program name, date, the name of the program
      supervisor, and the names of all participants, shall be maintained by each program. Copies of the sign-in sheets shall be provided to CBPA at regular intervals.</text>
    <text>b. In programs where participant confidentiality must be maintained, or where it would be impractical to maintain a sign-in sheet for participants, the NPC must submit an alternative method for participant record-keeping for approval by the NPC Council
      of Chairpersons.</text>
    <text>c. CBPA shall add all new participants’ names from the sign-in sheets to the NPC’s membership rolls within thirty (30) days of receipt.</text>
