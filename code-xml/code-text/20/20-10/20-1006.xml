    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>

    </level>
  </level>

    <num>1006.2.</num>
    <text>NATS will provide a compliance account for each budget source that will hold the current compliance year and future year allowances. NATS will label each account with an account number and provide the following information, at a minimum, to be associated
      with each account: name of account owner, name of AAR, mailing address of AAR, phone number of AAR, street address of associated budget source, and state in which the budget source is located.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>1006.3.</num>
    <text>NATS will allow establishment of general accounts. Any person or group may open a general account. An AAR must be designated for a general account and shall have obligations similar to an AAR designated by a budget source.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>1006.4.</num>
    <text>Only an AAR can request transfers of allowances in a NATS account. For each account, one AAR and one alternate shall be identified to represent the owner or operator of the budget source, or owner of a general account. The AAR shall be responsible
      for all transactions and reports submitted to the NATS. The Alternate AAR shall have the same authority as the primary representative. However, all correspondence from the Administrator shall be directed to the primary AAR.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>1006.5.</num>
    <text>The AAR will be officially designated upon the Director&amp;#8217;s receipt of a form entitled &amp;#8220;Account Certificate of Representation&amp;#8221;, which constitutes an agreement of representation and contains, at a minimum, the following
      information:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>Identification of the budget source by plant name, state, and boiler number for which the certification of representation is submitted;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>The name, address, telephone and facsimile numbers of the AAR and any alternate; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>A list of owners and operators of the budget source.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>1006.6.</num>
    <text>The certificate of representation shall be signed by the AAR for the budget source and shall contain the following statement:</text>
    <text>I certify that I, (name of AAR), was selected as the Authorized Account Representative as applicable by an agreement binding on the owners and operators of the budget source legally designated as (name of facility).</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>1006.7.</num>
    <text>Designation of an AAR for each budget source must be completed within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this section. Thereafter, an AAR can be replaced by submitting a new &amp;#8220;Account Certificate of Representation&amp;#8221;. The Director
      will confirm the change of AAR once the change is recorded in NATS.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>1006.8.</num>
    <text>Each facility account will have a unique identification number and each allowance will be assigned a unique serial number. Each allowance serial number will also indicate the year of allocation.</text>
