    <text>768.1 As an alternative to complying with the provisionsof Â§Â§ 764 through67, the operator of asolvent cleaning machine may demonstrate complianceithÂ§ 768.3 and 768.4. 768.2 The operator shall maintainrecords sufficient toemonstrate compliance.
      The records, whichshall be maintained for not less thanwo (2) years, shall include,at a minimum, the quantity of solvent added to andemoved from thesolvent cleaning machine, and the dates of the additionndremoval. Â 768.3 If the cleaning machine
      has a solvent/airinterface, thewner or operator shall: Â (a) Maintain a logof solvent additions and deletionsor each solvent cleaningmachine; and Â (b) Ensure that emissions from eacholventcleaning machine are equal to or less than the applicable
      emissionlimitresented in Table II of this section. Table II. Emissionlimits for Batch Vapornd In-Line Solvent Cleaning Machines with aSolvent/Air Interface Solventleaning Machine Three (3) MonthRolling Average (kg./m.2/month) Monthly Emissionimit:(lb./ft.2/month)
      Solvent cleaning machines batch vapor 150 30.7Existingnline solvent cleaning machines 153 31.3 New inlinesolvent cleaning machines 990.2 Â 768.4 If the cleaningmachine is a batch vapor cleaning machine and doesot have asolvent/air interface, the
      owner or operator shall: (a) Maintain alogf solvent additions and deletions for each solvent cleaningmachine; and Â (b)nsure that the emissions from each solventcleaning machine are equal to or lesshan the appropriate limitsas described in Â§ 768.5
      and 768.6. Each ownerroperator of a batch vapor or in-line cleaning machine shalldemonstrateompliance with the applicable three (3) month rollingaverage monthly emissionimit on a monthly basis. Â 768.5 Forcleaning machines with a cleaning capacityhat
      is less than orequal to two and ninety-five one hundredths cubic meters2.95m.3), the emission limit shall be determined using Table I inÂ§ 767.3 orhe equation in Â§ 768.6. If thetable is used, and the cleaning capacity ofhe cleaning machinefalls
      between two cleaning capacity sizes, then the lower ofhetwo (2) emission limits applies; 768.6 For cleaning machines with acleaningapacity that is greater than two and ninety-five onehundredths cubic meters2.95 m.3), the emission limit shall bedetermined
      using the following equation: EL = 330 (vol)0.6Â where: Â EL = the three (3) month rolling averagemonthlymission limit (kilograms/month); vol = the cleaningcapacity of machine (cubiceters); Â 768.7 Each owner oroperator of a batch vapor or inline
      solventleaning machine shalldemonstrate compliance with the applicable three (3) monthollingaverage monthly emission limit on a monthly basis. If theapplicable three3) month rolling average emission limit is notmet, an exceedance has occurred.ll
      exceedances shall be reportedto the District within thirty (30) days of theetermination of theexceedance. 768.8 The owner or operator of a batch vapor orn-linesolvent cleaning machine shall maintain records and determinecompliancen accordance with
      the following: (a) On the firstoperating day of every monthnsure that the solvent cleaningmachine system contains only clean liquidolvent; (1) Thisincludes, but is not limited to, fresh unused solvent,ecycledsolvent, and used solvent that has been
      cleaned of soils; (2) Afill lineust be indicated during the first month the measurementsare made; (3) Theolvent level within the machine must be returnedto the same fill-line eachonth, immediately before calculatingmonthly emissions; and (4) The
      solventleaning machine does nothave to be emptied and filled with fresh unused solventefore thecalculations. (b) Using the records of all solvent additionsnddeletions for the previous monthly reporting period, determinesolventmissions using one
      (1) of the following equations: (1) Forcleaning machinesith a solvent/air interface: Â Âwhere: Â E = the total halogenated HAPolvent emissions fromthe solvent cleaning machine during the most recentonthlyreporting period (kilograms of solvent per
      square meter ofsolvent/airnterface area per month);Â SA = the total amountof halogenated HAP liquidolvent added to the solvent cleaningmachine during the most recent monthlyeporting period (kilogramsof solvent per month); LSR = the total amount
      ofalogenated HAPliquid solvent removed from the solvent cleaning machine duringhemost recent monthly reporting period (kilograms of solvent permonth);Â SSR =he total amount of halogenated HAP solventremoved from the solvent cleaningachine in solid
      waste during themost recent monthly reporting period (kilogramsf solvent permonth) determined from tests conducted using EPA referenceethod25d or by engineering calculations included in the compliancereport;Ârea = the solvent/air interface area
      of the solventcleaning machine (squareeters); or Â (2) For cleaningmachines without a solvent/air interface: E =A-LSR-SSR where: E =the total halogenated HAP solvent emissions from theolventcleaning machine during the most recent monthly reportingeriod(kilograms
      of solvent per month); SA = the total amount ofhalogenated HAPiquid solvent added to the solvent cleaningmachine during the most recentonthly reporting period (kilogramsof solvent per month);Â LSR = the totalmount of halogenatedHAP liquid solvent
      removed from the solvent cleaningachine duringthe most recent monthly reporting period (kilograms of solventermonth);Â SSR = the total amount of halogenated HAP solventremoved from theolvent cleaning machine in solid waste during themost recent
      monthly reportingeriod (kilograms of solvent permonth) determined from tests conducted using EPAeference method25d (40 C.F.R. Â§ 60) or by engineering calculationsincludedn the compliance report; and (c) Determine the monthlyrolling average, EA,
      forhe three (3) month period ending with themost recent reporting period using one1) of the followingequations: (1) For cleaning machines with a solvent/airnterface:Â where: Â EA = the average halogenated HAP solventemissions overhe preceding three
      (3) monthly reporting periods,(kilograms of solvent perquare meter of solvent/air interfacearea per month); E = halogenated HAPolvent emissions for eachmonth (j) for the most recent three (3) monthlyeporting periods(kilograms of solvent per square
      meter of solvent/airnterfacearea);Â j=1 = the most recent monthly reporting period; j=2 =theonthly reporting period immediately before j=1; j=3 = themonthly reportingeriod immediately before j=2; or Â (2) Forcleaning machines without aolvent/air
      interface: Â Âwhere: EA = the average halogenated HAP solventmissions over thepreceding three (3) monthly reporting periods (kilograms ofolventper month);Â E = halogenated HAP solvent emissions for eachmonth (j) forhe most recent three (3) monthly
      reporting periods(kilograms of solvent peronth); j=1 = the most recent monthlyreporting period; j=2 = the monthlyeporting period immediatelybefore j=1; j=3 = the monthly reporting periodmmediately beforej=2. SOURCE: Notice of Final Rulemaking published
