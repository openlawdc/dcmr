    <text>The operator of each machine shalldemonstrate that the emissions from each machine, on a three (3)month rolling average, are equal to or less than the allowablelimit determined by the use of Table I in this section or thefollowing equation if the
      volume of the cleaning machine exceedstwo and ninety-five one hundredths cubic meters (2.95 m.3): ÂEL = 330 (vol.)0.6 Â where: Â EL = the threemonth rollingaverage monthly emission limit (kilograms/month); vol. = thecleaning capacity of machine

      good air pollution control practices; The operatorof each machine equipped with a solvent adsorber shall measure andrecord the concentration of solvent in the exhaust of the carbonadsorber weekly with a colorimetric detector tube designed tomeasure
      a concentration of one hundred parts per million (100 ppm)by volume of solvent to air at an accuracy of plus or minustwenty-five parts per million (25 ppm) by volume. This test shallbe conducted while the solvent cleaning machine is in the workingmode
      and is venting to the adsorber; 767.6 The operator of eachmachine equipped with a solvent adsorber shall maintain and operatethe machine and adsorber system so that emissions from the adsorberexhaust do not exceed one hundred parts per million (100
      ppm) byvolume, measured while the solvent cleaning machine is in theworking mode and is venting to the adsorber; 767.7 The machineshall be equipped with a permanent, conspicuous label summarizingthe operating requirements in Â§ 767.8; Â 767.8Airless
      cleaning machines and airtight cleaning machines shall beoperated in accordance with the following procedures: Â (a)Waste solvent, still bottoms, and sump bottoms shall be collectedand stored in closed containers. The closed containers may containa
      device that allows pressure relief but does not allow liquidsolvent to drain from the container; (b) Parts shall be oriented sothat the solvent drains freely from the parts: (1) Cleaned partsshall be drained at least fifteen (15) seconds or until
      drippingceases, whichever is longer; and (2) Parts having cavities or blindholes shall be tipped or rotated while the part is draining; (c)Parts baskets or parts shall not be removed from the inline vaporcleaning machine until dripping has ceased;
      (d) Sponges, fabric,wood, leather, paper products and other absorbent materials shallnot be cleaned in the airless cleaning machines and airtightcleaning machines; (e) Spills during solvent transfer and use ofthe airless cleaning machines and airtight
      cleaning machines shallbe cleaned up immediately, and the wipe rags or other absorbentmaterials shall be immediately stored in covered containers fordisposal or recycling; (f) Work area fans shall be located andpositioned so that they do not blow
      across the airless cleaningmachine and airtight cleaning machine; (g) Spraying operationsshall be done in the vapor zone or within a section of the machinethat is not exposed to the ambient air; and (h) Solvents shall betransferred using threaded
      or other leak proof couplings and theend of the pipe in the solvent sump shall be located beneath theliquid solvent surface when solvent is added to or drained from theairless cleaning machine and airtight cleaning machine. SOURCE:Notice of Final
