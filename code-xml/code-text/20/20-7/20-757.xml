      or otherfactors, the use of the product will result in cumulative VOCemissions below the highest emitting representative spill-proofsystem or representative spill-proof spout in its product categoryas determined from applicable testing. Â</text>

    <text>For the purposes of this section, aâ€œrepresentative spill-proof systemâ€or a â€œrepresentative spill-proofspoutâ€ means a portable fuel container, spout, orcombination portable fuel container and spout which, at the time ofexemption, meets the performance
      standards specified inÂ§ 752 or the Certification Requirements Specified inâ€œCP-501, Certification Procedure for PortableFuel Containers and Spill-Proof Spouts,â€ adopted byCARB July 26, 2006, including any subsequent amendments. 757.5 Amanufacturer
      shall submit an application in writing to theDepartment for an innovative product exemption according to thefollowing requirements: (a) The application must include thesupporting documentation that quantifies the emissions from theinnovative product,
      including the actual physical test methods usedto generate the data; (b) The applicant must provide anyinformation necessary to enable the Department to establishenforceable conditions for granting the exemption; and (c) Allinformation including
      proprietary data submitted by a manufacturerpursuant to this section shall be handled in accordance with theDistrict of Columbia confidentiality requirements in 20 DCMRÂ§ 106. 757.6 Within thirty (30) days of receipt of theexemption application,

      Department shall specify the test methods fordetermining conformance to the conditions established, which mayinclude criteria for reproducibility, accuracy, and sampling andlaboratory procedures. 757.9 For any portable fuel container orspout for
      which an innovative product exemption has been grantedpursuant to this section, the manufacturer shall notify theDepartment in writing at least thirty (30) days before themanufacturer changes a productâ€™s design,delivery system, or other factors
