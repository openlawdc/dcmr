  <heading>CONSUMER PRODUCTS – INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS EXEMPTION (§ 20-736)</heading>
  <level>
    <num>736.1.</num>
    <text>Any manufacturer claiming an exemption from the Table of Standards in § 720.1 based on a CARB Innovative Products exemption under the Innovative Products provisions in Subchapter 8.5, Article 2, § 94511, or Subchapter 8.5, Article 1, § 94503.5 of
      Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations, must submit to the Department a copy of the CARB Innovative Product exemption decision including the executive order and all conditions established by CARB applicable to the exemption.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>736.2.</num>
    <text>Manufacturers of consumer products that have been granted an Innovative Products exemption under the Innovative Products provisions in Subchapter 8.5, Article 2, § 94511, or Subchapter 8.5, Article 1, § 94503.5 of Title 17 of the California Code of
      Regulations based on California specific data, or that have not been granted an exemption by CARB, may apply for an Innovative Products exemption from the District of Columbia if the product meets the following criteria:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The manufacturer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that due to some characteristic of the product formulation, design, delivery systems or other factors, the use of the product will result in less VOC emissions as compared to:</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(1)</num>
      <text>The VOC emissions from a representative consumer product which complies with the VOC limits specified in the Table of Standards in § 720.1; or</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(2)</num>
      <text>The calculated VOC emissions from a non-complying representative product, if the product had been reformulated to comply with the VOC limits specified in the Table of Standards in § 720.1; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(3)</num>
      <text>VOC emissions shall be calculated using the following equation:</text>
    </level>
    <text>ER = ENC x VOCSTD ¸ VOCNC</text>
    <text>where:</text>
    <text>ER = The VOC emissions from the non-complying representative product, had it been reformulated;</text>
    <text>ENC = The VOC emissions from the non-complying representative product in its current formulation;</text>
    <text>VOCSTD = The VOC limit specified in the Table of Standards in § 720.1; and</text>
    <text>VOCNC = The VOC content of the non-complying product in its current formulation;</text>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>If a manufacturer demonstrates that the equation in paragraph (a) of this section yields inaccurate results due to some characteristic of the product formulation or other factors, an alternative method that accurately calculates emissions may be
        used upon approval of the Department;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>For the purposes of this section, representative consumer product means a consumer product that meets all of the following criteria:</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(1)</num>
      <text>The representative product shall be subject to the same VOC limit in the Table of Standards in § 720.1 as the innovative product;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(2)</num>
      <text>The representative product shall be of the same product form as the innovative product, unless the innovative product uses a new form that does not exist in the product category at the time the application is made; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(3)</num>
      <text>The representative product shall have at least similar efficacy as other consumer products in the same product category based on tests generally accepted for that product category by the consumer products industry;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(d)</num>
      <text>To apply for an innovative products exemption under this section, a manufacturer shall submit a written application to the Department, which includes:</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(1)</num>
      <text>The supporting documentation that demonstrates the emissions from the innovative product, including the actual physical test methods used to generate the data and, if necessary, the consumer testing undertaken to document product usage; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(2)</num>
      <text>Any information necessary to enable the Department to establish enforceable conditions for granting the exemption including the VOC content for the innovative product and test methods for determining the VOC content;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(e)</num>
      <text>The Department shall comply with the following process in responding to applications for exemptions:</text>

        effective date of the modified VOC standard, except for those innovative products that have VOC emissions less than the applicable lowered VOC limit and for which a written notification of the product&amp;#8217;s emissions status versus the lowered
