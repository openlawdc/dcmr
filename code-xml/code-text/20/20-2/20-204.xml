    <num>204.1.</num>
    <text>This section shall apply to theconstruction of any new major stationary source or any majormodification at an existing major stationary source in an areadesignated as nonattainment under Â§ 107(d)(1)(A)(i) ofthe Clean Air Act.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>204.2.</num>
    <text>Permit applications submitted pursuant tothis section shall include a control technology evaluation todemonstrate that any new major stationary source or majormodification will meet the lowest achievable emission rate (LAER)for all new or modified
      emissions units, unless otherwise providedin this section.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>204.3.</num>
    <text>Any permit application submitted pursuantto this section shall provide for creditable emission reductionoffsets pursuant to this section. The application shall providedocumentation adequate for the Department to assess the validity ofthe proposed
      offsets.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>204.4.</num>
    <text>Any new major stationary source or majormodification to be constructed in an area designated asnonattainment shall comply with LAER as determined by theDepartment and set forth in a preconstruction permit issuedpursuant to this section.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>204.5.</num>
    <text>Any new major stationary source or majormodification to be constructed in a nonattainment area shall notbegin actual construction without a permit issued by the Departmentthat incorporates the applicable control technology and offsetrequirements as
      specified in Â§ 204.18 and204.19.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>204.6.</num>
    <text>Before applying for a permit to construct,the owner or operator shall determine applicability pursuant to theprovisions below and submit this determination with the permitapplication: (a) A project is a major modification for a regulatedNSR pollutant
      as defined in Â§ 299; (b) Determine whetherthe emissions increases from the project are significant as definedin Â§ 299 by summing the potential to emit from each newemissions unit and the difference between the potential to emit foreach existing
      unit affected by the project after the change and theactual emissions prior to the change; (c) Determine whether theproject results in a significant net emissions increase as definedin Â§ 299; (d) An emissions unit is considered affectedby the project
      if an emissions increase from the unit would occuras a result of the project, regardless of whether a physical changeor change in the method of operation will occur at the particularemissions unit; and (e) Subsection 204.17 pertains to projects
      thatresult in a significant increase in a regulated NSR pollutant, butdo not result in a significant net emissions increase.</text>

    <text>Any major stationary source subject to aPlantwide Applicability Limit (PAL) for a regulated NSR pollutantshall comply with the requirements set forth in Â§208.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>204.8.</num>
    <text>For sources and modifications subject toany preconstruction review program, the baseline for determiningcredit for emissions reductions is the emissions limit under theState Implementation Plan in effect at the time the application toconstruct is
      filed, except that the offset baseline shall be theactual emissions of the source from which offset credit is obtainedwhere: (a) The demonstration of reasonable further progress andattainment of ambient air quality standards is based upon theactual
      emissions of sources located within the designatednonattainment area; or (b) The State Implementation Plan does notcontain an emissions limitation for that source or sourcecategory.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>204.9.</num>
    <text>In determining offset credits, thefollowing provisions shall also apply: (a) Where the emissionslimit under the State Implementation Plan provides for greateremissions than the potential to emit of the source, offset creditswill be granted only for
      control below the potential to emit; (b)For an existing fuel combustion source, credit shall be based onthe allowable emissions under the applicable State ImplementationPlan for the type of fuel being burned at the time the applicationto construct
      is filed: (1) If the existing source commits to switchto a cleaner fuel at some future date, emissions offset creditbased on the allowable (or actual) emissions for the fuels involvedis not acceptable, unless the permit is conditioned to require
      theuse of a specified alternative control measure which would achievethe same degree of emissions reduction should the source switchback to a dirtier fuel at some later date; and (2) The Departmentshould ensure that adequate long-term supplies of
      the new fuel areavailable before granting emissions offset credit for fuelswitches; and (c) Emissions reductions achieved by shutting down anexisting source or curtailing production or operating hours belowbaseline levels may be generally credited
      if such reductions aresurplus, permanent, quantifiable, and federally enforceable: (1)The shutdown or curtailment is creditable only if it occurred on orafter the date of the most recent emissions inventory used in theplan&amp;#8217;s demonstration
      of attainment, unless an earlier cutoff datehas been specified in the plan; (2) In no event may credit be givenfor shutdowns that occurred prior to August 7, 1977; and (3) Forpurposes of this subsection, the Department may choose to considera prior
      shutdown or curtailment to have occurred after the date ofits most recent emissions inventory, if the inventory explicitlyincludes as current existing emissions the emissions from suchpreviously shutdown or curtailed sources.</text>
