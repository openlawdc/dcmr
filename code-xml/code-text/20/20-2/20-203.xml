    <text>The emission limitation for any pollutant required of any source shall not be affected by the following:</text>

      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>Any source&amp;#8217;s stack height that exceeds GEP stack height, with GEP stack height meaning the greater of the following:</text>

      <num>(3)</num>
      <text>The height demonstrated by a fluid model or a field study approved by the Director, which ensures that the emissions from the stack do not result in excessive concentrations of any air pollutant as a result of atmospheric downwash, wakes, or eddy
        effects created by the source itself, nearby structures or nearby terrain features; or</text>

    <num>203.2.</num>
    <text>For purposes of modeling to establish emission limitations, the lesser of the physical stack height and the following measurements shall be used:</text>

      <text>Sixty-five (65) meters (two hundred thirteen feet (213 ft.));</text>

      <text>The height demonstrated by a fluid model or a field study approved by the Director, which ensures that the emissions from the stack do not result in excessive concentrations of any air pollutant as a result of atmospheric downwash, wakes, or eddy

    <text>In determining whether a demonstration is performed satisfactorily, the Mayor shall take into consideration, among other factors, the methods, documents, and practices used in performing the demonstration.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>203.4.</num>
    <text>The provisions of §§ 203.1 and 203.2 shall not apply to stack heights in existence, or dispersion techniques implemented prior to December 31, 1970, except when a source proposes to connect to a stack built prior to December 31, 1970.</text>

    <num>203.5.</num>
    <text>Before the Mayor issues a permit to a source based on a GEP stack height that exceeds the height allowed by § 203.1(a)(1) or 203.1(a)(2), the Mayor shall notify the public of the availability of the demonstration study and shall hold a public hearing
      on the study if a hearing is requested within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Mayor gives notice of the study.</text>

    <num>203.6.</num>
    <text>Section 203 shall not restrict, in any manner, the actual stack height of any source; however, the actual stack height of a source may be regulated under this chapter.</text>
