  <heading>FUEL-BURNING PARTICULATE EMISSION (§ 20-600)</heading>
  <level>
    <num>600.1.</num>
    <text>The emission of particulate matter from any fuel burning equipment shall not be in excess of the rate determined by the following formula:</text>
    <text>E = 0.17455 H-0.23522</text>
    <text>Where:</text>
    <text>E = Allowable emissions in pounds per million British Thermal Units (BTUs) of heat input, and</text>
    <text>H = Heat input to the fuel-burning equipment in millions of BTUs per hour;</text>
    <text>Provided, that:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>Nothing in § 600.1 shall be construed to allow the emission of particulate matter from any fuel-burning equipment in excess of the rate of thirteen hundredths pound (0.13 lb) per million BTU of heat input; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Nothing herein shall be construed to require the emission of particulate matter from any fuel-burning equipment to be lower than the rate of two hundredths pound (0.02 lb) per million BTU of heat input.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>600.2.</num>
    <text>Compliance with or violation of § 600.1 shall be determined by performance tests conducted when the fuel-burning equipment (from now on referred to as &amp;#8220;equipment&amp;#8221;) is operating under conditions encountered in normal operation that
      create the worst emissions in relation to allowable emissions. Tests shall be conducted at the maximum continuous operating capacity of the equipment unless the Mayor has reason to believe that the worst emissions in relation to allowable emissions
      occur under other conditions.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>600.3.</num>
    <text>For equipment equipped for the blowing of soot, the frequency of soot blowing during performance tests shall be proportioned to the frequency of soot blowing during the conditions at which the equipment is tested.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>600.4.</num>
    <text>Equipment shall not be specially tuned or optimized immediately before performance testing unless the owner or operator of the equipment represents in writing to the Mayor that the equipment will be maintained in an optimized condition subsequent
      to performance testing.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>600.5.</num>
    <text>The conditions for testing may be modified by the Mayor to suit specified sampling conditions or needs based on good practice, judgment and experience; Provided, that no such modification shall have the effect of increasing the stringency of the standard.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>600.6.</num>
    <text>When determining compliance with or violation of § 600.1 by performance tests, the test results shall be calculated using the method described in § 60.45(f)(5) of Title 40 CFR, revised as of July 1, 1982.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>600.7.</num>
    <text>The blowing of soot from any fuel-burning equipment fired by solid fuels shall be prohibited except during the hours of 10 a.m to 4 p.m.; Provided, that the Mayor may allow the blowing of soot during other periods upon a finding that the blowing of
      soot is desirable for the efficient operation of the fuel-burning equipment or for the safety of personnel or equipment.</text>
