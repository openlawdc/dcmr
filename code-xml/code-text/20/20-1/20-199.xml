    <text>When used in Chapters 1 through 9 of this title, and in forms prescribed under those chapters, where not otherwise distinctly expressed or manifestly incompatible with the intent of this subtitle, the following terms shall have the meaning ascribed:</text>
    <text>Actual emissions – the actual rate of emissions of a pollutant from an emissions unit, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (f):</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>In general, actual emissions as of a particular date shall equal the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during the twenty-four (24) month period which precedes the particular date and which is representative
        of normal source operation;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Actual emissions shall be calculated using the unit’s actual operating hours, production rates, and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the selected time period;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>When a project involves multiple emissions units or multiple regulated NSR pollutants, or both, only one (1) consecutive twenty-four (24) month period within the last five (5) years must be used to determine the actual emissions for all pollutants
        and for all the emissions units affected by the project;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(d)</num>
      <text>The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive twenty-four (24) period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual emissions;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(e)</num>
      <text>The Department may allow the use of a different time period within the last five (5) years upon determining that it is more representative of operations; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(f)</num>
      <text>For any emissions unit which has not begun normal operations on the particular date, actual emissions shall equal the potential to emit of the unit on that date.</text>
    </level>
    <text>Administrator – Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency or an authorized representative.</text>
    <text>Affected facility &amp;#8211; in §702 of this subtitle each individual source within a petroleum refinery complex that could potentially leak volatile organic compounds to the atmosphere, including, but not limited to, pump seals, compressor seals,
      seal oil degassing vents, pipeline valves, flanges and other connections, pressure relief devices, process drains, and open ended pipes.</text>
    <text>Air pollutant &amp;#8211; dust, fumes, gas, mist, smoke, vapor, odor, particulate matter, or any combination thereof, except that these terms shall not include uncombined water in the atmosphere unless it presents a safety hazard.</text>
    <text>Air pollution &amp;#8211; the presence in the outdoor atmosphere of one or more pollutants in sufficient quantities and of characteristics and duration as are likely to be injurious to public welfare, to the health of humans, plant or animal life,
      or to property, or which interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of life and property.</text>
    <text>Allowable emissions – the emission rate of a stationary source calculated using the maximum rated capacity of the source (unless the source is subject to enforceable limits which restrict the operating rate, hours of operation, or both) and the most
      stringent of the following:</text>

      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The applicable standards as set forth in 40 C.F.R. parts 60, 61, and 63;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Any applicable State Implementation Plan emissions limitation, including those with a future compliance date; or</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>The emissions rate specified under any requirement or permit condition that is enforceable as a practical matter, including those with a future compliance date.</text>

    <text>Best available control technology (BACT) – an emissions limitation (including a visible emissions standard) based on the maximum degree of reduction for each regulated NSR pollutant which would be emitted from any proposed major stationary source
      or major modification which the Department, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such source or modification through application of production processes
      or available methods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of such pollutant. In no event shall application of best available control technology result in emissions of
      any pollutant that would exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable standard under 40 C.F.R. parts 60, 61, or 63. If the Department determines that technological or economic limitations on the application of measurement methodology to a particular
      emissions unit would make the imposition of an emissions standard infeasible, a design, equipment, work practice, operational standard, or combination thereof, may be prescribed instead to satisfy the requirement for the application of BACT. Such
      standard shall, to the degree possible, set forth the emissions reduction achievable by implementation of such design, equipment, work practice or operation, and shall provide for compliance by means that achieve equivalent results.</text>
