    <text>When used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed (some of the definitions were codified in the Acts, thus indicated as [Statutory], and are reprinted below for regulatory efficiency):</text>
    <text>Abatement – a set of measures, except interim controls, that eliminates lead-based paint hazards by either the removal of paint and dust, the enclosure or encapsulation of lead-based paint, the replacement of painted surfaces or fixtures, or the removal
      or covering of soil, and all preparation, cleanup, disposal, and post-abatement clearance testing activities associated with such measures. [Statutory]</text>

    <text>Child-occupied facility – a building, or portion of a building, constructed prior to 1978, which as part of its function receives children under the age of six (6) on a regular basis, and is required to obtain a certificate of occupancy as a precondition
      to performing that function. The term &amp;#8220;child-occupied facility&amp;#8221; may include a preschool, kindergarten classroom, and child development facility licensed under subchapter II of Chapter 20 of Title 7 of the D.C. Official Code.
      The location of a child-occupied facility as part of a larger structure does not make the entire structure a child-occupied facility. Only the portion of the facility occupied or regularly visited by children under age six (6) shall be considered
      the child-occupied facility. [Statutory]</text>
    <text>Clearance examination – an evaluation of a property to determine whether the property is free of any deteriorated lead-based paint and underlying condition, or any lead-based paint hazard, underlying condition, lead-contaminated dust, and lead-contaminated

    <text>Clearance report – a report issued by a risk assessor, a lead-based paint inspector, or a dust sampling technician that finds that the area tested has passed a clearance examination, and that specifies the steps taken to ensure the absence of lead-based
