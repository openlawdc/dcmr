    <text>Noise &amp;#8211; this term shall have the same definition as &amp;#8220;sound,&amp;#8221; in the Act.</text>
    <text>Noise disturbance &amp;#8211; any sound which is loud and raucous or loud and unseemly and unreasonably disturbs the peace and quiet of a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities in the vicinity thereof, unless the making and continuing of the

      occur, the duration of the noise. In addition, the Mayor may consider the magnitude of the noise relative to the maximum sound levels permitted under this act, the possible obstruction or interference with vehicular or pedestrian traffic, the number
      of people that are or would be affected, and such other factors as are reasonably related to the impact of the noise on the health, safety, welfare, peace, and quiet of the community. A noise shall not be considered a noise disturbance if it is
      made during noncommercial public speaking during the daytime and does not exceed 80 decibels inside the nearest occupied residence in districts zoned R-1A, R-1B, R-2, R-3, or R-4. Except as it may otherwise conflict with provisions of this act,
