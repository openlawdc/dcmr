    <text>Sales of eligible foods such as those listed in § 443.10(a), (b) and (c) shall be exempt from sales tax if sold in larger quantities whether purchased with cash or food stamps.</text>

    <text>If a sale combines taxable eligible food items, such as those listed in § 443.10, with nontaxable eligible food items, and if the purchase is to be made in part with food stamps and in part with cash, the vendor shall allocate the food stamps to the
      taxable food items first, then to the nontaxable food items.</text>
    <text>For example: A customer arrives at the check-out stand with five dollars ($ 5.00) in food stamps and five dollars ($ 5.00) in cash. The amount of the purchase totals eight dollars ($ 8.00) of nontaxable eligible food in two dollars ($ 2.00) of taxable
      items first and then allocate the remaining three dollars ($ 3.00) of food stamps to the nontaxable food items. Thus, in this case, no sales tax would be collected.</text>
