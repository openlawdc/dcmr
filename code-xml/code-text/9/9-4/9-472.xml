    <text>Real property maintenance services performed on the construction site shall not be considered &amp;#8220;other services performed as part of construction.&amp;#8221; Real property maintenance services, such as trash hauling, window cleaning, building
      cleaning, or any of the services listed at §§ 472.2, 472.6, 472.8, 472.9, 472.10 and 472.11, performed on the construction site shall be subject to the District sales tax. &amp;#8220;Other services performed as part of construction&amp;#8221; includes

    <text>A vendor purchasing real property maintenance services from another vendor may issue a resale certificate for the taxable services rendered. The certificate shall be preserved by the vendor accepting the certificate and shall be the authority for
      that vendor not to add reimbursement for the tax to the price of the service.</text>
    <text>For example, Company A is performing a janitorial contract for XYZ Management Company. Included in the contract are services for window cleaning and trash removal. These services are subcontracted to B and C. Company A may issue a certificate of resale
      to B and to C. Neither B nor C would collect tax from Company A for the services they rendered. However, Company A would collect tax from XYZ.</text>
