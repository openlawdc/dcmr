    <num>1103.5.</num>
    <text>The following are examples of the application of §§ 1103.1 to 1103.4:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>On January 1, 2001, Company D, a QHTC, hires 10 employees at an annual salary of $40,000 each. Since the workers perform the activities described in D.C. Official Code § 47 -1817.1(5)(A)(iii); they are classified as qualified employees. None of
        the qualified employees are affected by the restrictions of § 1103.3. The annual payroll each year for the 10 qualified employees is $400,000. For tax years 2001 and 2002, Company D is entitled to a tax credit equal to 10% of the annual salaries
        of $400,000 received by the 10 qualified employees, or $40,000.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Assume the same facts as in example 1, except the annual payroll for each year is $600,000. For tax years 2001 and 2002, Company D is entitled to a tax credit of only $5,000.00 for each qualified worker, or $50,000, since the limitation of § 1103.2
        would apply.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>Assume the same facts as in example 1, except 5 of the qualified employees are entry level and are paid $30,000 each and 5 of the qualified employees are highly skilled and are paid $70,000 each. For tax years 2001 and 2002, the limitation of §
        1103.1 applies to the 5-entry level qualified employees and the limitation of § 1103.2 applies to the highly skilled qualified employees. Therefore, Company D is entitled to a tax credit of $40,000, calculated as follows: (1) the total annual
        wages paid to the entry level qualified employees is $150,000 of which 10%, or $15,000, is available for the credit, (2) the total annual wages paid to the highly skilled qualified employees is $350,000 and since the credit for each of the five
        highly skilled qualified employee exceeds $5,000, only $25,000 is available for the credit, (3) $15,000 plus $25,000 totals $40,000.</text>
