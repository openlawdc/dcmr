  <level>
    <num>3702.2.</num>
    <text>In determining the maximum amount of the allowable federal credit, it shall be presumed that the maximum allowable federal credit determined in accordance with §2011(b) of the Internal Revenue Code subject to the limitations of §§ 2011(e) and (f)
      was claimed and that all other requirements of § 2011 were satisfied. Failure to claim the maximum amount of the federal credit on the federal estate tax return shall not affect the amount of the District estate tax due.</text>

    <text>For resident decedents owning no real or tangible personal property located outside the District, the District estate tax shall equal the federal credit (determined in accordance with the Act and §§ 3702.1 and 3702.2 of this chapter.</text>
    <text>Example: The decedent was domiciled in the District with all of the decedent&amp;#8217;s property located in the District. The value of the decedent&amp;#8217;s total gross estate is nine hundred twenty thousand dollars ($920,000) and the allowable
      deductions are one hundred seventy thousand dollars ($170,000). The allowable credit for state death taxes (&amp;#8220;federal credit&amp;#8217;) is twenty thousand and four hundred dollars ($20,400). Consequently, the District estate tax due is
      twenty thousand and four hundred dollars ($20,400).</text>

    <text>For resident decedents owning property located outside the District, the District estate tax shall equal the federal credit (determined in accordance with the Act and §§ 3702.1 and 3702.2) reduced by the lessor of one of the following:</text>

    <text>Example: The decedent resided in the District but owned a summer beach house in Maryland. The value of her gross estate is one million four hundred fifteen thousand dollars ($1,415,000) and the allowable deductions are four hundred fifteen thousand
      dollars ($415,000). The allowable credit for state death taxes (&amp;#8220;federal credit&amp;#8221;) is thirty-three thousand two hundred dollars ($ 33,200). The District estate tax will be thirty-three thousand two hundred dollars ($33,200) reduced
      by the lesser of the tax actually paid by the estate to Maryland or the amount allowed by statute. In this case, the thirty-three thousand two hundred dollars ($33,200) is reduced by the statutory amount of eleven thousand six hundred fourteen dollars
      ($11,614). The District estate tax is twenty-one thousand five hundred eighty-six dollars ($21,586).</text>

    <text>The District estate tax shall be imposed on the estate of a nonresident decedent to the extent that the decedent&amp;#8217;s property has a taxable situs in the District. The tax is computed under the following formula:</text>
