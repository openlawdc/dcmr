      <text>The Separate Return Limitation Year (SRLY) provisions of IRC § 172 and IRC § 1502, and the federal income tax regulations thereunder, shall apply in those cases where a member of a District of Columbia affiliated group which has a D.C.-apportioned
        net operating loss carryforward leaves the group and either files a separate District of Columbia franchise tax return or joins in the filing of a consolidated return with a different District of Columbia affiliated group. The prorated amount
        assigned to each member who incurred the loss is determined by the following formula:</text>

    <text>(A/B) x C = D</text>
    <text>A/B = Ratio based on one corporation&amp;#8217;s loss to total corporation losses</text>

    <text>D = Prorated amount of consolidated net operating loss assigned to the member.</text>
