    <text>If the taxpayer first meets the requirement for filing a declaration after September 15th (or in the case of a fiscal year taxpayer, after the 15th day of the 9th month of the fiscal year), the taxpayer may file an income tax return on or before the
      15th day of the 1st month of the succeeding taxable year (in lieu of making a declaration) and the return shall be considered a declaration. In such cases, the entire tax shall be paid with the return.</text>

    <text>If the taxpayer fails to file a declaration at the time required (including any extension of time), he or she shall pay, when the declaration is filed, all installments of estimated tax which he or she would have paid had he or she filed the declaration
      at the required time. Any remaining installments of tax shall be paid in the amounts and at the times they would be payable if the declaration had been filed at the required time.</text>
