    <text>The Agency may offer a game enhancement to the KENO Game that shall be known as KENO SPIN. Nothing in sections 928 and 929 shall be construed to repeal, amend or modify any provisions of this title concerning KENO except as provided herein.</text>
    <text>KENO SPIN offers KENO players a chance to multiply their KENO winnings by a factor of 1,2,3,4,5, or 10 in any single drawing.</text>

    <num>928.2.</num>
    <text>If a player wins KENO and played KENO SPIN, the player&amp;#8217;s winnings will be multiplied by the KENO SPIN number that was selected in the KENO SPIN drawing. The KENO SPIN drawing selections are 2,3,4,5,10, or &amp;#8220;Try Again&amp;#8221;.
      The notation, &amp;#8220;Try Again&amp;#8221; represents the number one (1) in the KENO SPIN drawing.</text>

    <text>A KENO SPIN wager is an additional $1.00 for every dollar wagered for KENO. For example, if a player wagers $2.00 for 3 consecutive drawings, the KENO amount wagered is $6.00. If the player wants to add KENO SPIN the ticket cost will double for a
      total cost of $12.00. The maximum KENO SPIN wager is $200.</text>

    <text>A separate random KENO SPIN drawing will be conducted for each KENO drawing. The KENO SPIN drawing will be selected by a computer-driven random number generator. The results of each KENO SPIN drawing will be displayed along with the corresponding
      KENO drawing results on a monitor at identified agent locations. Drawing results are also available on all lottery agent or claim center lottery terminals.</text>
