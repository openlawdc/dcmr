    <text>Prize Reserve Funding. Two and one thousand one hundred eighty-seven ten thousandths percent (2.1187%) of sales, including any specific statutorily mandated tax of a Selling Lottery to be included in the price of a lottery ticket, may be collected
      and placed in trust in the Sizzler Prize Pool or in one or more prize reserve accounts until the prize reserve accounts reach the amounts designated by the MUSL Product Group.</text>

    <text>In certain rare instances, the Hot Lotto® set prize amount may be less than the amount shown. In such case, the Sizzler prizes will be a multiple of the new Hot Lotto® prize amount. For example, if the Match 5 of the first set and none of the second
      set Hot Lotto® set prize amount of $30,000.00 becomes $27,000.00 under the rules of the Hot Lotto® game, then a Sizzler player winning that prize would win $81,000.00 ($27,000.00 x 3).</text>
