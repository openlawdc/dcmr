    <num>708.1.</num>
    <text>Any person seeking issuance of a non-First Amendment activity permit for a non- First Amendment parade, march, race, or walk-a-thon shall file an application with the Chief of Police on a form issued by the Chief of Police in person or by mail at
      the Metropolitan Police Department, Special Operations Division Headquarters, currently located at 2301 L Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20037. Application forms can be obtained on line at mpdc.dc.gov. Application forms will also be sent by fax

    <text>708.2 Where an application for a permit is filed sixty (60) days or more prior to the date of the proposed non-First Amendment activity, the application shall receive final action no later than thirty (30) days prior to the proposed date of the event.
      This provision shall not apply where the applicant has voluntarily agreed to waive the thirty (30) day time limit</text>

    <num>708.3.</num>
    <text>Subject to section 708.4, an application for a non-First Amendment activity permit shall be filed not less than fifteen (15) days before the date on which the event is proposed to be conducted. Applicants are encouraged to submit applications for
      approval of a permit as far in advance as is practical. The purpose of the notice and permit approval process is to avoid situations where more than one group seeks to use the same space at the same time. Early submission gives the Chief of Police
      or his or her designee and the applicant the maximum time to resolve any issues that may arise, and minimizes the possibility that an approved permit will already have been issued to another group for the desired time and place. It also provides
      the Metropolitan Police Department and other District agencies the ability to provide appropriate police protection, traffic control, and other support for participants and other individuals.</text>
