  <level>
    <num>543.4.</num>

  </level>
  <level>
    <num>543.7.</num>
    <text>Erosion and sediment control measures shall be in place to stabilize an exposed area as soon as practicable after construction activity has temporarily or permanently ceased but no later than fourteen (14) days following cessation, except that temporary
      or permanent stabilization shall be in place at the end of each day of underground utility work that is not contained within a larger development site.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>543.8.</num>
    <text>Permanent stabilization of streets and parking areas shall be with base course crushed stone or other Department-approved measures.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>543.9.</num>
    <text>Measures shall be implemented and corrective action taken, including as specified by the Department, to prevent the discharge to District sewers or District waterbodies of erodible material or waste material including those materials that have been
      transported off site.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>543.10.</num>
    <text>A site disturbing greater than five thousand square feet (5,000 ft2) of land shall:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>Adhere to a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) that:</text>
    </level>
    <text>The Department provides in its Stormwater Management Guidebook,</text>
    <text>The Department approves as including the minimum measures in the Department-provided SWPPP; or</text>
    <text>Is required under the Construction General Permit issued by Region III of the United States Environmental Protection Agency; and</text>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Post a legible copy of the SWPPP on site.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>543.11.</num>
    <text>A person shall avoid work on a slope in excess of fifteen percent (15%), to the maximum extent practicable. Where avoidance is not practicable, the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan for the site shall be designed, signed, and sealed by a professional
      engineer, licensed in the District of Columbia, and the applicant shall incorporate additional protection strategies which the Department may require in order to prevent erosion or transportation of sediments from the site.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>543.12.</num>
    <text>Except on an area that is undergoing construction, perimeter controls that disturb land, including dikes, swales, ditches, and perimeter slopes, shall be stabilized within one (1) week of initial land disturbance or redisturbance:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>On the surface of each disturbed area; and</text>
    </level>
    <text>On each associated slope greater than three (3) horizontal to one (1) vertical (3:1).</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>543.13.</num>
    <text>Runoff from the site shall be controlled by either diverting or conveying the runoff through areas with erosion and sediment control measures, such as through the installation of lined conveyance ditches, channels, or checkdams.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>543.14.</num>
    <text>Critical area stabilization shall be applied to each cut and fill slope:</text>
    <text>That is equal to or steeper than 3:1;</text>
    <text>That is flatter than 3:1 if the Department determines that the soil characteristics require it; and</text>
    <text>To every cut and fill slope when construction is out-of-season for planting and until permanent protection can be provided.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>543.15.</num>
    <text>If the Department determines that a cut and fill slope is likely to result in erosion by stormwater of sediment from the site onto adjacent property or a nearby waterbody, then the cut and fill slope shall be protected against erosion by the use of
      structural diversions that are protected by vegetation or matting, in a frequency and manner that a geotechnical or civil engineer licensed in the District of Columbia has determined, based on site conditions, is sufficient to prevent erosion.</text>
  </level>

    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>

    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
