  <level>
    <num>807.1.</num>
    <text>The purpose of this section is to establish minimum safety standards for the design and use of non-portable, mechanical lift, tapered, rear or side loading solid waste (refuse) containers (also referred to in this section as &amp;#8220;slant-refuse
      bins&amp;#8221; or simply &amp;#8220;bins&amp;#8221;) to reduce or eliminate hazards that may exist in the instability of these bins.</text>
