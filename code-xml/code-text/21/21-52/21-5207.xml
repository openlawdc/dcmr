      <text>Creditable Service</text>
    </level>
    <text>1. In computing an employee&amp;#8217;s creditable service for severance pay purposes, all service that is creditable for annual leave accrual purposes is included as creditable service for severance pay purposes; however, military service is not
      to be counted unless it interrupts otherwise creditable civilian service.</text>
    <text>2. Additional service credit shall be provided as follows:</text>
    <text>A. Four (4) years for an employee who qualifies for veterans preference as provided in §5207.13; and</text>

    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>Computation of Severance Pay</text>
    </level>
    <text>1. Severance pay shall be calculated as follows:</text>
    <text>A. Base severance pay is computed on the basis of one (1) week&amp;#8217;s basic pay at the rate received by the employee immediately before separation for each year of creditable service up to and including ten (10) years and two (2) week&amp;#8217;s
      of basic pay at the rate received by the employee immediately before separation for each year of creditable service beyond ten (10) years; and</text>
    <text>B. An age allowance computed on the basis of ten percent (10%) of the total base severance pay for each year by which the recipient&amp;#8217;s age on the date of separation exceeds forty (40) years.</text>
    <text>2. The age allowance specified in subsection 5207.22(c)1.B. shall be computed on an employee&amp;#8217;s total years of age over age forty (40), by providing credit at the rate of twenty-five percent (25%) of a year for each three (3) months that
      the employee&amp;#8217;s age exceeds age forty (40).</text>
    <text>3. Basic pay means the regular or base salary or wages paid by the Authority to an individual immediately before separation, specifically excluding overtime, compensatory time, gainsharing, awards, bonuses, on-call pay, call-in pay, call-back pay,
      hazard pay, differentials, and premium pay.</text>
    <text>4. If the severance pay based on age and service exceeds twenty-six (26) weeks of pay at the employee&amp;#8217;s rate of basic pay received immediately before separation, the severance pay payable will be limited to the twenty-six (26) weeks of pay.</text>

    <text>A. Severance payments will be paid in installments on the same pay period intervals as if the individual were still employed until the severance pay is exhausted.</text>
    <text>B. If the individual dies before severance pay is exhausted, the payments will be continued to the survivor of the individual until exhausted.</text>
    <text>C. Severance payments are subject to all applicable federal, District of Columbia, and state employment taxes.</text>
    <text>2. Restrictions</text>
    <text>A. Severance pay is not a basis for calculation for payment of any other type of Authority or Federal Government benefits, and it may not be included in the basis for computation of such benefits. A period covered by severance pay is not a period
      of Authority service or employment.</text>
    <text>B. Employees who are receiving disability compensation based on the individual&amp;#8217;s compensable injury either under D.C. Code § 1-623.01 et seq. or the Authority&amp;#8217;s Worker&amp;#8217;s compensation provider are not eligible for severance
