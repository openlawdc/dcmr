    <text>1106.1 If requested, the Director may allow a person to conduct a site-specific study to change the numerical criteria when at least one (1) of the following conditions exists:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The species, or endangered species, at the site are more or</text>

    <text>If the criteria in subsection 1104.8 are found to be unsuitable for the District waters based upon the conditions described in subsection 1106.1, when requested to do so, the Director may adopt site-specific criterion for Class C waters, except for
      mercury and selenium, or for Class D waters, only when a site-specific study necessitates.</text>

    <num>1106.3.</num>
    <text>When requested to do so, based upon the conditions described in subsection 1106.1 and, if warranted, the Director shall allow site-specific studies to generate scientific information regarding:</text>

    <num>1106.4.</num>
    <text>A person or persons planning to conduct a site-specific study shall submit a complete plan of study to the Director for approval, and the site-specific study shall be carried out only after the Director approves the study in writing, subject to the

      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>For noncarcinogens:</text>
    </level>
    <text>NEW CRITERIA = (RfD x WT)/(FC x L x FM x BCF)</text>
    <text>where RfD is the reference dose from the EPA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database, WT is seventy (70) kilograms, FC is the daily fish consumption by the exposed population in kilograms per day, L is the ratio of lipid fraction of fish
      tissue consumed to three percent (3%), FM is the food chain multiplier and BCF is the bioconcentration factor for fish with three percent (3%) lipid.</text>

    <num>1106.11.</num>
    <text>If the effluent limitation for a metal in a discharge permit is specified as &amp;#8220;total recoverable&amp;#8221;, and the criterion for it in subsection 1104.8 is specified as &amp;#8220;dissolved&amp;#8221;, either of the following two (2) approaches
      based on The Metals Translator: Guidance for Calculating a Total Recoverable Permit Limit From a Dissolved Criterion, EPA-823-B-96-007, June 1996, may be used, subject to prior review and approval by the Director:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The criterion may be used as total recoverable for the purpose of establishing effluent limitations; or</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>A site-specific ratio between the dissolved and total recoverable metal may be developed by systematic monitoring and analysis of the effluent and of the receiving water at the edge of the mixing zone during periods that reflect the environmental
        conditions upon which the permit was issued. This ratio shall incorporate considerations to avoid toxicity to aquatic organisms from deposition to the sediment outside of the mixing zone. The ratio of dissolved to total recoverable metal shall
        then be used to determine the total recoverable effluent limits based on the dissolved metal criterion.</text>
