  <level>
    <num>1157.1.</num>
    <text>Except as specified in ยง 1157.2, the monitoring requirements shall apply to the owners and operators of landfills, solid waste piles (other than piles of gravel, resident soils and other such material), land spreading disposal facilities, surface
      impoundments of wastes and solid waste discharge facilities.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>1157.2.</num>
    <text>The monitoring requirements shall not pertain to other programs and activities of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs already covered by a promulgated rule that has specific monitoring requirements including the federal discharge permits
      program and Hazardous Waste Management, 20 DCMR 40.</text>

    <num>1157.3.</num>
    <text>All permitted facilities requiring ground water monitoring shall submit for approval, a ground water monitoring program to determine representative background water quality and the quality of the water passing the point of compliance.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>1157.4.</num>
    <text>Background monitoring points shall be located at points where potential sources of ground water contamination from the permitted site will not affect ground water quality.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>1157.5.</num>
    <text>The monitoring program shall include, but not be limited to, the uppermost aquifer and any aquifer in the point of compliance that is hydrologically connected to the surface waters of the District and antidegradation segments and drinking water aquifers
      of adjacent jurisdictions. At a minimum, the monitoring program shall include the following:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>One (1) upgradient well and three (3) downgradient wells installed at appropriate locations and depth to yield ground water samples from the uppermost aquifer and all hydrologically connected aquifers below the active portion of the facility;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>All monitoring wells shall be cased to maintain the integrity of the monitoring well bore hole. The casing shall allow collection of representative water samples. The well shall be constructed in such a manner as to prevent contamination of the
        samples, the sampled strata, water bearing aquifers and prevent contamination between aquifers;</text>

      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>A sampling and analysis plan;</text>

      <num>(e)</num>
      <text>A quarterly sampling frequency for the first two (2) years. If early warning values are not reached or a trend analysis shows no significant contamination, sampling frequency will either be reduced or discontinued on approval of the Director; and</text>
