    <text>Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI) &amp;#8211; a performance index that measures the average time required to restore service to the average customer experiencing a sustained interruption per sustained interruption. The measure is

    <text>Major service outages &amp;#8211; customer interruption occurrences and durations during time periods when 10,000 or more of the electric utility&amp;#8217;s District of Columbia customers are without service and the restoration effort due to this
      major service outage takes more than twenty-four (24) hours.</text>

    <text>Manhole explosion &amp;#8211; incident in which a release of energy from the manhole occurs and one or more manhole covers are dislodged from their respective frames, or other debris, such as cement or dirt, is projected into the air.</text>
    <text>Momentary interruption &amp;#8211; loss of electric service of a duration limited to the time required to restore electric service by automatic and supervisory-controlled switching operation or by manual switching at a location where an operator is

    <text>Non-major service outages &amp;#8211; customer service outages caused by the failure of devices such as breakers, fuses, feeder lines, substation equipment, etc., lasting over eight (8) hours, regardless of how many customers are affected; or customer

    <text>Power quality &amp;#8211; the characteristics of electric power received by the customer, with the exception of sustained interruptions and momentary event interruptions. Characteristics of electric power that detract from its quality include waveform
      irregularities and voltage variations, either prolonged or transient.</text>
    <text>Smoking manhole &amp;#8211; a manhole incident in which smoke, but no visible flame, is escaping from holes in the cover or around the cover&amp;#8217;s edge.</text>
