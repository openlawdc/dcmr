  <heading>TECHNICAL STANDARDS AND ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (ยง 15-4008)</heading>
  <level>
    <num>4008.1.</num>
    <text>The technical standard to be used in evaluating all interconnection requests under Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4 reviews, unless otherwise provided for in these procedures, is IEEE Standard 1547. Until IEEE 1547.2, &amp;#8220;Application Guide
      for IEEE 1547 Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems&amp;#8221; is completed and approved, the PJM Interconnection Planning Manual Attachment H, which is available at www.pjm.com/committees/mrc/downloads/20060911-item-03-
      attachment-h-to-manual-14b-2-to-10-mw.pdf, shall be used as a guide (but not a requirement) to detail and illustrate the interconnection protection requirements that are provided in IEEE 1547.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4008.2.</num>
    <text>When an interconnection request is for a small generator facility that includes multiple energy production devices at a site for which the interconnection customer seeks a single point of common coupling, the interconnection request shall be evaluated
      on the basis of the aggregate nameplate capacity of multiple devices.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4008.3.</num>
    <text>When an interconnection request is for an increase in capacity for an existing small generator facility, the interconnection request shall be evaluated on the basis of the new total nameplate capacity of the small generator facility.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4008.4.</num>
    <text>An EDC shall maintain records of the following for a minimum of three (3) years:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The total number of and the nameplate capacity of the interconnection requests received, approved and denied under Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4 reviews;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>The number of interconnection requests that were not processed within the timelines established in this rule;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>The number of scoping meetings held and the number of feasibility studies, impact studies, and facility studies performed and the fees charged for these studies;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(d)</num>
      <text>The justifications for the actions taken to deny interconnection requests; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(e)</num>
      <text>Any special operating requirements required in interconnection agreements that are not part of the EDC&amp;#8217;s written and published operating procedures applicable to small generator facilities.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4008.5.</num>
    <text>An EDC shall provide a report to the Commission containing the information required in Section 4008.4, paragraphs (a)-(c) within ninety (90) calendar days of the close of each year.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4008.6.</num>
    <text>An EDC shall designate a contact person and contact information on its website and the Commission&amp;#8217;s website for submission of all interconnection requests and from whom information on the interconnection request process and the EDC&amp;#8217;s
      electric distribution system can be obtained regarding a proposed project. The information shall include studies and other materials useful to an understanding of the feasibility of interconnecting a small generator facility at a particular point
      on the EDC&amp;#8217;s electric distribution system, except to the extent that providing the materials would violate security requirements or confidentiality agreements, or otherwise deemed contrary to District or federal law/regulations. In appropriate
      circumstances, the EDC may require confidentiality prior to release of information.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4008.7.</num>
    <text>When an interconnection request is deemed complete, a modification other than a minor equipment modification that is not agreed to in writing by the EDC, shall require submission of a new interconnection request.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4008.8.</num>
    <text>When an interconnection customer is not currently a customer of the EDC at the proposed site, the interconnection customer, upon request from the EDC, shall provide proof of site control evidenced by a property tax bill, deed, lease agreement, or
      other legally binding contract.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4008.9.</num>
    <text>To minimize the cost of interconnecting multiple small generator facilities, the EDC or the customer may propose a single point of common coupling for multiple small generator facilities located at a single site. If the interconnection customer rejects
      the EDC&amp;#8217;s proposal for a single point of common coupling, the interconnection customer shall pay the additional cost, if any, of providing a separate point of common coupling for each small generator facility. If the EDC rejects the customer&amp;#8217;s
      proposal for a single point of common coupling without providing a written technical explanation, the EDC shall pay the additional cost, if any, of providing a separate point of common coupling for each small generator facility.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4008.10.</num>
    <text>Small generator facilities shall be capable of being isolated from the EDC. For level 2-4 small generator facilities interconnecting to a primary line, the isolation shall be by means of a lockable, visible-break isolation device accessible by the
      EDC. For level 2-4 small generator facilities interconnecting to a secondary line, the isolation shall be by means of a lockable isolation device whose status is clearly indicated and is accessible by the EDC. The isolation device shall be installed,
      owned and maintained by the owner of the small generation facility and located between the small generation facility and the point of common coupling. A draw-out type circuit breaker with a provision for padlocking at the draw-out position can be
      considered an isolation device for purposes of this requirement. Level 1 interconnections do not require an external isolation device.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4008.11.</num>
    <text>A level 2-4 interconnection customer may elect to provide the EDC access to an isolation device that is contained in a building or area that may be unoccupied and locked or not otherwise readily accessible to the EDC, by installing a lockbox provided
      by the EDC that shall provide ready access to the isolation device. The interconnection customer shall install the lockbox in a location that is readily accessible by the EDC, and the interconnection customer shall permit the EDC to affix a placard
      in a location of its choosing that provides clear instructions to the EDC&amp;#8217;s operating personnel on access to the isolation device. In the event that the interconnection customer fails to comply with the terms of this subsection and the
      EDC needs to gain access to the isolation device, the EDC shall not be held liable for any damages resulting from any necessary EDC action to isolate the interconnection customer.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4008.12.</num>
    <text>Any metering necessitated by a small generator interconnection shall be installed, operated and maintained in accordance with applicable tariffs. Any such metering requirements shall be clearly identified as part of the small generator interconnection
      agreement executed by the interconnection customer and the EDC.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4008.13.</num>
    <text>The EDC shall design, procure, construct, install, and own any Distribution Upgrades. The actual cost of the Distribution Upgrades, including overheads, shall be directly assigned to the interconnection customer. The interconnection customer may be
      entitled to financial contribution from any other EDC customers who may in the future utilize the upgrades paid for by the interconnection customer. Such contributions shall be governed by the rules, regulations, and decisions of the Commission.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4008.14.</num>
    <text>EDC monitoring and control of small generator facilities shall be permitted only if the nameplate rating is equal to or greater than 3 MW. Any monitoring and control requirements shall be consistent with the EDC&amp;#8217;s written and published requirements
      and shall be clearly identified as part of an interconnection agreement executed by the interconnection customer and the EDC.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4008.15.</num>
    <text>The interconnection customer shall design its Small Generator Facility to maintain a composite power delivery at continuous rated power output at the Point of common coupling at a power factor within the power factor range required by the EDC&amp;#8217;s
      applicable tariff for a comparable load customer. The EDC may also require the Interconnection Customer to follow a voltage or VAR schedule if such schedules are applicable to similarly situated generators in the control area on a comparable basis
      and have been approved by the Commission. The specific requirements for meeting a voltage or VAR schedule shall be clearly specified in Attachment 3 of the &amp;#8220;District of Columbia Small Generator Interconnection Rule Level 2-4 Standard Agreement
      for Interconnection of Small Generator Facilities&amp;#8221;. (Under no circumstance shall these additional requirements for reactive power or voltage support exceed the normal operating capabilities of the Small Generator Facility.)</text>
