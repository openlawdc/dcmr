    <num>4002.1.</num>
    <text>Interconnection equipment shall be deemed certified with this Chapter upon establishment of the following:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The interconnection equipment has been tested in accordance with the appropriate codes and standards referenced in this Chapter by any nationally recognized testing laboratory (&amp;#8220;NRTL&amp;#8221;) recognized by the United States Occupational
        Safety and Health Administration (&amp;#8220;OSHA&amp;#8221;) to test and certify interconnection equipment pursuant to the relevant codes and standards listed in Section 4002.4.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>The interconnection equipment has been labeled and is publicly listed by such NRTL at the time of the interconnection application.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>The interconnection customer verifies that the intended use of the interconnection equipment falls within the use or uses for which the interconnection equipment is labeled, and is listed by the NRTL.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4002.2.</num>
    <text>If the interconnection equipment is an integrated equipment package such as an inverter, then the interconnection customer shall show that the generator or other electric source being utilized is compatible with the interconnection equipment and is
      consistent with the testing and listing specified for this type of interconnection equipment.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4002.3.</num>
    <text>If the interconnection equipment includes only interface components (switchgear, multi-function relays, or other interface devices), then an interconnection customer shall show that the generator or other electric source being utilized is compatible
      with the interconnection equipment and is consistent with the testing and listing specified for this type of interconnection equipment.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4002.4.</num>
    <text>To meet the requirements for certification, interconnection equipment shall be evaluated by an NRTL in accordance with the following codes and standards:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>IEEE 1547.1 Standard for Conformance Tests Procedures for Equipment Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Underwriters Laboratories (&amp;#8220;UL&amp;#8221;), UL 1741 Inverters, Converters, and Controllers for Use in Independent Power Systems;</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4002.5.</num>
    <text>The interconnection equipment shall meet the requirements of the most current approved version of each document listed in Section 4002.4, as amended and supplemented at the time the interconnection request is submitted for certification.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4002.6.</num>
    <text>Certified interconnection equipment shall not require further design testing or production testing, as specified by IEEE Standard 1547 Sections 5.1 and 5.2, or additional interconnection equipment modification to meet the requirements. However, nothing
      herein shall preclude the need for an onsite Witness Test or operational test by the interconnection customer.</text>
