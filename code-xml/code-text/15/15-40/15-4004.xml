  <heading>LEVEL 1 INTERCONNECTION REVIEWS (ยง 15-4004)</heading>
  <level>
    <num>4004.1.</num>
    <text>For Level 1 Review, the EDC shall use Level 1 procedures for evaluation of all interconnection requests to connect inverter-based small generation facilities when:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The small generator facility has a nameplate capacity of 10 kW or less; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>The customer interconnection equipment proposed for the small generator facility is certified.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4004.2.</num>
    <text>For Level 1 Adverse Impact Screens, the EDC shall evaluate the potential for adverse system impacts using the following screens, which must be satisfied:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>For interconnection of a proposed small generator facility to a line section on a radial distribution circuit, the aggregated generation on the line section, including the proposed small generator facility, shall not exceed fifteen (15) percent
        of the line section&amp;#8217;s annual peak load.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>For interconnection of a proposed small generator facility to an area network with two (2) two-way power flow or to a spot network distribution system with two (2) two-way power flow, there shall be no reverse power conditions through the EDC network
        protector. The proposed small generator facility shall not cause network protector cycling; cause inadvertent network protector opening; or impact any other customer under any conditions (including fault conditions).</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>For interconnection of a proposed small generator facility to the load side of spot network protectors and, when aggregated with other generation, load may not exceed five (5) percent of the spot network&amp;#8217;s maximum load.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(d)</num>
      <text>When a proposed small generator facility is to be interconnected on a single-phase shared secondary line, the aggregate generation capacity on the shared secondary line, including the proposed small generator facility, may not exceed 20 kW.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(e)</num>
      <text>When a proposed small generator facility is single-phase and is to be interconnected on a center tap neutral of a 240 volt service, its addition may not create an imbalance between the two sides of the 240 volt service of more than twenty (20) percent
        of the nameplate rating of the service transformer.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(f)</num>
      <text>Construction of facilities by the EDC on its own system is not required in order to accommodate the small generator facility.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4004.3.</num>
    <text>The Level 1 Interconnection Review shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>An EDC shall, within ten (10) business days after receipt of the interconnection request, inform the interconnection customer in writing or by electronic mail that the interconnection request is complete or incomplete and indicate what materials,
        if any, are missing.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>When an interconnection request is complete, the EDC shall assign a queue position.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>The EDC shall, within fifteen (15) business days after the end of the ten (10) business days noted above in paragraph (a), verify that the small generator facility equipment can be interconnected safely and reliably using Level 1 screens and provide
        an interconnection agreement to the customer. If deemed necessary by the EDC, the EDC shall conduct a spot or area network impact study at its own expense within the fifteen (15) business days referenced above.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4004.4.</num>
    <text>Unless the EDC determines and demonstrates to the interconnection customer that a small generator facility cannot be interconnected safely or reliably to its system and provides a letter to the interconnection customer explaining its reasons for denying
      an interconnection request, the EDC shall approve the interconnection request subject to the following conditions:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The small generator facility has been approved by local or municipal electric code officials with jurisdiction over the interconnection;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>A certificate of completion has been received by the EDC from the interconnection customer. Completion of local inspections may be designated on inspection forms used by local inspecting authorities;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>The EDC has either waived the right to a Witness Test or completed its Witness Test in accordance with Section 4004.6; and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(d)</num>
      <text>The interconnection customer has signed a small generator interconnection agreement. If an interconnection customer does not sign the agreement within thirty (30) business days after submission by the EDC by mail or electronic mail, the interconnection
        request may be deemed withdrawn unless the deadline has been extended in writing by mutual agreement of the parties.</text>
    </level>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4004.5.</num>
    <text>Within ten (10) business days of the estimated commissioning date, the EDC may, upon reasonable notice and at a mutually convenient time, conduct a Witness Test of the small generator facility to ensure that all equipment has been appropriately installed
      and that all electrical connections have been made in accordance with applicable codes. If the EDC does not perform the Witness Test within the ten (10) business day period or such other time as is mutually agreed to by the parties, the Witness
      Test is deemed waived.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4004.6.</num>
    <text>When a small generator facility is not approved under a Level 1 review, the interconnection customer may submit a new interconnection request for consideration under Level 2, Level 3, or Level 4 procedures.</text>
