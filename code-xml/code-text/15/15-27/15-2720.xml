      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Results for this measure shall be calculated by dividing the number of installation dates met by the total number of installation date commitments made. Results shall be stated as a percentage rounded to the hundredth using traditional mathematical
        rounding;</text>
    </level>
    <text>Data collected for this measure shall be disaggregated into residential and business customer categories and reported by these categories; and</text>
    <level>
      <num>(d)</num>

    <level>
      <num>(e)</num>
      <text>Results for this measure shall be calculated by dividing the number of initial trouble reports by the total number of access lines. This figure is then multiplied by one hundred (100). Results shall be reported to the hundredth decimal place, rounded
