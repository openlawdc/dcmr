    <text>2706.1 Applicability</text>
    <text>This section applies when a CLEC that has one (1) or more customers proposes to abandon the provisioning of telecommunications services to the local exchange voice services market or a portion of the local exchange voice services market (including,

      to:</text>
    <text>Terminate service to an individual customer for reasons uniquely applicable to that customer (for instance, because the customer has failed to pay charges due to the CLEC);</text>
    <text>Withdraw a feature of a service (for instance, caller ID or call waiting);</text>
    <text>Limit availability of a service so that the service is available only to the CLEC’s customers who already subscribe to that service; or</text>
    <level>
      <num>(d)</num>
      <text>Change a rate, term or condition for a service.</text>
