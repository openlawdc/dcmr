  <level>
    <num>4103.1.</num>
    <text>The retail rates to SOS customers of the Electric Company will consist of the sum of the following components:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The seasonally-differentiated and, if applicable, time-of-use differentiated load weighted average price of all awarded contracts for Wholesale Full Requirements Service for each SOS Customer Group;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Retail charges designed to recover, on an aggregate basis, FERC-approved Network Integrated Transmission Service charges (“NITS”) and related charges and any other PJM charges and costs incurred by the Electric Company directly related to the Electric
        Company’s SOS load obligation for each SOS Customer Group. According to Commission Order No. 12395 and the PEPCO/Conectiv merger Settlement Agreement, the Electric Company has agreed to accept a “transmission deadband” which would adjust transmission
        and distribution rates so that the overall rates remain constant, unless transmission rates increase or decrease more than ten (10) percent. Any future increase in transmission rates will be constrained by the “transmission deadband” provision
        approved in Order No. 12395;</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>An administrative charge; and</text>

    <text>Parties to the proceedings can file comments within seven (7) days calendar days and reply comments within 12 calendar days of the Electric Company’s submission of the retail rates and administrative charge pursuant to Section 4103.2. The Commission
      shall thereafter issue an Order approving or rejecting the retail rates and/or administrative charge. The Electric Company shall file a revised tariff setting forth the new retail rates and/or administrative charges within seven (7) calendar days

    <text>The Administrative Charge will be designed to recover the Electric Company’s incremental costs for procuring and providing the service. Actual incremental costs shall include, but not be limited to, a proportionate share of SOS customer uncollectibles
      for each SOS Customer Group, Commission Consultant expenses (as described in Section 4108.2), wholesale bidding expenses, working capital expenses related to SOS for each SOS Customer Group, wholesale supply transaction costs related to wholesale
      supplier administration and transmission service administration, wholesale payment and invoice processing, incremental billing process expenses, customer education costs, incremental system costs, and legal and regulatory filing expenses related
      to SOS requirements.</text>

      Company’s distribution rates, including the determination of the Electric Company’s return for providing distribution service.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4103.6.</num>
    <text>All customers eligible for SOS will be informed of the applicable SOS retail rates, to the extent practical, for the service at least two (2) months prior to the beginning of each service year. If it is not practicable to provide such notice, the
      Electric Company shall file with the Commission and serve upon the Parties notice of that fact, the reasons for the delay, and the expected date for the provision of such information.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>4103.7.</num>
    <text>Retail prices to customers shall be adjusted at least twice a year to reflect seasonal pricing and other appropriate price changes. Prior to each year of SOS, the Electric Company shall file with the Commission, estimates of actual incremental costs
      for the upcoming year. Such costs will be collected from customers, on a load weighted average, subject to an annual adjustment to reflect actual costs.</text>

    <text>All investment, revenue and expenses associated with the provision of SOS by the Electric Company shall be separate from investment, revenues and expenses associated with the Electric Company’s distribution service so that there will be no subsidization
