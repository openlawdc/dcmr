  <heading>PLAN ASSETS (§ 7-1901)</heading>
  <level>
    <num>1901.1.</num>
    <text>Individuals who exercise any discretionary authority or discretionary control regarding the management or disposition of plan assets or who provide investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to plan assets may be deemed to be fiduciaries
      under § 102(20)(A) of the Reform Act (D.C. Official Code § 1-702(20)(A) (2011 Repl.)) unless an exception applies.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>1901.2.</num>
    <text>This rule describes what constitutes plan assets with respect to the Funds&amp;#8217; investment in another entity for purposes of the fiduciary duties imposed by the Reform Act. This rule is intended to be modeled after the U.S. Department of Labor’s
      (DOL) plan assets regulation, as amended (29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-101).</text>
    <text>Generally, when the Funds invest in another entity, the Funds’ assets include its investment, but do not, solely by reason of such investment, include any of the underlying assets of the entity. However, in the case of the Funds&amp;#8217; investment
      in an equity interest of an entity that is neither a publicly-offered security nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, its assets include both the equity interest and an undivided interest
      in each of the underlying assets of the entity, unless it is established that:</text>
    <text>the entity is an operating company, or</text>
    <text>equity participation in the entity by benefit plan investors and by the Funds is not significant.</text>
    <text>Therefore, any person who exercises authority or control respecting the management or disposition of such underlying assets, and any person who provides investment advice with respect to such assets for a fee (direct or indirect), is a fiduciary of
      the Funds.</text>

    <text>1901.3 Equity Interests and Publicly-Offered Securities.</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>An “equity interest” means any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable law and which has no substantial equity features. A profits interest in a partnership, an undivided ownership interest
        in property and a beneficial interest in a trust are equity interests.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>A “publicly-offered security” is a security that is:</text>
    </level>
    <text>freely transferable,</text>
    <level>
      <num>(2)</num>
      <text>widely held (more than 100 holders unrelated to management and to each other), and</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(3)</num>
      <text>registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (or scheduled to be registered subsequent to an initial public offering).</text>

  </level>
  <level>
    <num>1901.4</num>
    <text>1901.4 Operating Company.</text>
    <text>An “operating company” is an entity that is primarily engaged in the production or sale of a product or service other than the investment of capital, plus hybrid entities known as a “venture capital operating company” or a “real estate operating company.”</text>
  </level>

    <num>1901.5</num>
    <text>1901.5 Insignificant Equity Participation.</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>Equity participation in an entity by benefit plan investors or by the Funds is “significant” on any date if, immediately after the most recent acquisition of any equity interest in the entity, 25 percent or more of the value of any class of equity
        interests in the entity is held by benefit plan investors or by the Funds. For this purpose, the value of any equity interests held by a person (other than a benefit plan investor) who has discretionary authority or control with respect to the
        assets of the entity or any person who provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets, or any affiliate of such a person, shall be disregarded.</text>
    </level>
    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>A “benefit plan investor” is any of the following:</text>
    </level>
    <text>any employee benefit plan (as defined in § 3(3) of ERISA)), that is subject to the provisions of Title I of ERISA;</text>
    <text>any plan described in and covered by § 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code; or</text>
    <text>any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of, and to the extent of, benefit plan investors’ investment in the entity.</text>
    <level>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>An “affiliate” of a person includes any person, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the person. For this purpose, “control”, with respect to a person other than an
        individual, means the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of such person.</text>

  <level>
    <num>1901.6</num>
    <text>1901.6 Joint Ownership.</text>
    <text>For purposes of this rule, where the Funds jointly own property with others, or where the value of the Funds&amp;#8217; equity interest in an entity relates solely to identified property of the entity, such property shall be treated as the sole property
      of a separate entity.</text>

    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>When the Funds own all of the outstanding equity interests (other than director&amp;#8217;s qualifying shares) in an entity, its assets include those equity interests and all of the underlying assets of the entity.</text>
