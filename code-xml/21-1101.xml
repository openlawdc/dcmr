    <text>1101.3 The Director may remove a designated use, establish a partial use, or establish sub-categories of a use for a particular surface water segment or body if a use attainability analysis can demonstrate that attaining the designated use is not
      feasible because:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>Naturally occurring pollutant concentrations prevent the attainment of the use;</text>

      <text>Natural, ephemeral, intermittent or low flow conditions or water levels prevent the attainment of the use, unless these conditions may be compensated for by the discharge of sufficient volume of effluent discharges without violating the District’s
        water conservation requirements to enable uses to be met;</text>

      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>Human caused conditions or sources of pollution prevent the attainment of the use and cannot be remedied or would cause more environmental damage to correct than to leave in place;</text>

      <num>(d)</num>
      <text>Dams, diversions or other types of hydrologic modifications preclude the attainment of the use, and it is not feasible to restore the waterbody to its original condition or, to operate the modification in a way that would result in the attainment
        of the use;</text>

      <text>Physical conditions related to the natural features of the waterbody, such as the lack of proper substrate, cover, flow, depth, pools, riffles, and the like unrelated to water quality, preclude attainment of aquatic life protection uses; or</text>

    <text>A designated use specified in section 1101 may not be removed, and a partial use that involves the removal of the designated use, may not be established if:</text>

      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The use is actually attained in the surface water segment or body on or after November 28, 1975, unless a use requiring more stringent criteria is added; or</text>

    <level>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>The uses will be attained by implementing effluent limits required under sections 301(b) and 306 of the federal Clean Water Act and by implementing cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control.</text>

    <text>If a permittee requests the Director to conduct a use attainability analysis and provides a reasonable basis for the need, the Director shall:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>Conduct a public meeting in the watershed of the affected segment or waterbody to inform the public of the nature of the use change requested and the basis of the request, and solicit the opinions and views of the public prior to determining whether
