    <text>Baseline control period emissions &amp;#8211; a representative average of the actual NOx emissions from a stationary source during two (2) consecutive control periods within the five (5) years preceding an opt-in application, which is not greater
      than the allowable emissions for that source as established by a District permit or regulation.</text>
    <text>Budget &amp;#8211; the numerical result in tons per control period of NOx emissions that results from the application of the emission reduction requirement of the OTC MOU, dated September 27, 1994, which is the maximum amount of NOx that may be emitted
      from the budget sources collectively during a given control period.</text>
    <text>Budget source &amp;#8211; a fossil-fuel-fired boiler or indirect heat exchanger with a maximum design heat input of two hundred fifty (250) mmBtu/hr or more or an electric generating facility with a rated output of fifteen (15) MWe or more. This term
      also applies to any person who applies to opt into and has been accepted for the NOx Budget Program.</text>
    <text>Compliance account &amp;#8211; a budget source&amp;#8217;s NATS account in which are held current and future year allowances useable for a specific designated control period as indicated by their unique serial number. Continuous emissions monitoring
      system or CEMS &amp;#8211; the equipment used to sample, analyze and measure air pollutants and provide a permanent record of emissions expressed in 1b./mmBtu and tons per day. The following component parts are included in a continuous emissions

    <text>General account &amp;#8211; a NATS account that is not a compliance account.</text>
    <text>Heat input &amp;#8211; the product (expressed in mmBtu/time) of the gross calorific value of the fuel (expressed in Btu/lb.) and the fuel feed rate into the combustion device (expressed in fuel mass/time) and does not include the heat derived from
      preheated combustion air, recirculated flue gases, or exhaust from other sources.</text>
    <text>Indirect heat exchanger &amp;#8211; combustion equipment in which the flame or products of combustion are separated from any contact with the principal material in the process by metallic or refractory walls, which includes steam boilers, vaporizers,
